IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29844  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. L. THURSTON  
Filed: 12 August 2025  

Mr H stands before this court to be sentenced following conviction on two counts: one of conducting an act in preparation for terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one of possession of an article for a purpose connected to terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct in question spans a period commencing in late 2022 through to his arrest in February 2025.  

The defendant was apprehended at 07:15 on 18 February 2025 by Counter-Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM) officers, who executed warrants at his registered address on Selwyn Road. The warrants were authorised pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 and followed scrutiny of encrypted communications intercepted under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. At the point of arrest, Mr H was found with multiple electronic devices, including a laptop, an external hard drive, and storage media containing encrypted user accounts evidencing a pattern of deliberate concealment.

The policing operation that led to this arrest was the culmination of a long and resource-intensive investigation. The digital forensic efforts required coordination between the CTPWM’s digital investigations unit and experts from the National Crime Agency’s cyber division. Delays in decryption were exacerbated by the use of custom encryption keys and virtual private network (VPN) infrastructures routed through multiple jurisdictions. This exemplifies the increasing complexity of contemporary counter-terrorism investigations, which demand both technical expertise and extensive inter-agency cooperation. It should be noted that the operational resources devoted to this case—measured in analyst hours and technological expenditure—reflect the gravity with which such threats are regarded by law enforcement and the state.  

In the earlier stages of this matter, the court encountered unavoidable procedural delays. The Legal Aid Agency’s initial reluctance to authorise external expert forensic costs led to an adjournment of the plea and trial preparation hearing originally scheduled for 24 April 2025. Such administrative hurdles are regrettably frequent in cases involving sensitive digital material and costly decryption contracts. While the court does not seek to impugn the LAA’s commitment to justice, systemic underfunding is a reality that continues to undermine the proper and timely administration of cases carrying such public importance.  

The backdrop to the case is framed not solely by statutory infringement but by wider societal concerns. The domestic counter-terrorism landscape increasingly wrestles with a post-internet landscape where ideological extremism transmutes rapidly through online forums and encrypted messaging services. The role of so-called “self-radicalisers,” prone to consuming and repurposing violent rhetoric absent direct contact with traditional terrorist networks, complicates prevention strategies and risk assessment. It is within this contemporary context that Mr H’s conduct is to be understood.  

It is similarly germane to mention supportive material received from various agencies and community organisations, illustrating the multifaceted public safety challenge faced by practitioners. The West Midlands Prevent Partnership provided a detailed chronological record of interventions between 2021 and 2024, noting the defendant's partial but ultimately unsustained engagement with deradicalisation programmes. Locally-based charities, including the Midlands Youth & Community Alliance, offered letters attesting to Mr H’s intermittent voluntary activity in food distribution schemes but emphasised his failure to maintain consistent attendance. Such contributions, while commendable on their own terms, must be weighed against the overall picture of risk and offending.  

The defendant’s initial custody status included brief periods on police bail with stringent conditions including electronic monitoring and restricted internet access. This measure, while necessary, placed additional administrative pressure on probation resources, which continue to operate under significant strain. Notably, in July 2024, a Probation Officer assigned to the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) reported constraints due to staff shortages, limiting capacity for closer supervision. These operational realities, though peripheral to the defendant’s culpability, illuminate the systemic challenges facing public protection regimes.  

Early in the proceedings, a referral was made to the National Health Service’s forensic mental health team for assessment under section 35 of the Mental Health Act 1983. Dr Anita Bellamy provided a comprehensive report, stating: “The defendant does not currently meet the threshold for detention under the Act but displays marked cognitive rigidity and an elevated propensity towards absolutist thinking patterns.” The report further notes a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with comorbid intermittent depressive disorder. Although treatment options have been mooted, engagement has been minimal and intermittent. It bears emphasis that no psychiatric disorder was deemed sufficient to diminish criminal responsibility, a finding consistent with principles enunciated in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, where mental health factors were carefully weighed against the public interest in containment.  

The court has also considered historical material, including correspondence from the defendant’s sister, Ms Leila H, who described family circumstances characterized by intermittent housing instability and periodic father absence. While acknowledging family support can sometimes serve as a mitigating feature, the court notes that these circumstances are not uncommon in urban, economically-challenged areas and do not in themselves excuse engagement in harmful activity.  

The Crown notes that this case was listed initially for trial on 15 July 2025 but was vacated following a late defence application to admit further expert witness evidence, including a probation report and additional psychological assessments. The court accepted the application in the interests of fairness, bearing in mind precedent such as R v. Gordon [2019] EWCA Crim 485, which reinforces the overriding objective of avoiding injustice, even at the cost of delay.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

As established in law, notably in the Supreme Court judgment of R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, the phrase “terrorist purpose” encompasses behaviours intended either to advance a political, religious or ideological cause or to intimidate the public, and the court’s sentencing must take account of the nature and extent of that purpose. Mr H’s activities, viewed in the aggregate, plainly manifest concerted intent, involving not just passive ideological alignment but actionable preparation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The Crown’s case benefitted from extensive digital forensic reports, including those prepared by the National Cyber Crime Unit. Their findings detailed encrypted files with names suggestive of weapon schematics and homemade explosive formulas. The use of encrypted partitioning software, specifically VeraCrypt, further evidences an intention to obfuscate material from lawful scrutiny — an aggravating factor noted in R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 1347 relating to possession of illicit terrorist literature, which confirmed the sufficiency of preparatory acts with partial document possession.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

It is noteworthy that during remand, routine cell searches revealed literature unrelated to the charges – specifically, a volume on urban architecture and several issues of an electronic magazine for model railway enthusiasts. These items, while entirely innocent in themselves, were tendered by defence counsel to mitigate character and to assert idiosyncratic hobbies, though their relevance to the terrorist conduct is, of course, negligible.  

Mr H’s interaction with the community outside of court proceedings includes participation in a local environmental restoration group, as reflected in letters from the Solihull Green Spaces Partnership. These outline his involvement in clearing invasive plant species, an initiative of limited scope but nonetheless representing a degree of civic engagement. This activity has been used to argue for a more nuanced and multifaceted view of the defendant’s personality, acknowledging that individuals are not unidimensional in their social identities.  

The court also heard submissions related to procedural fairness and the exercise of discretion under the Criminal Procedure Rules, especially regarding the timing of the guilty pleas. Mr H entered formal pleas late in proceedings, at the last possible moment before trial commencement, prompting the court to reflect on the principles set forth in R v. Haslett [2021] EWCA Crim 902 and R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440, cases highlighting the reduced credit available for pleas entered post-full disclosure and extensive trial preparation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Among the evidence, an origin point was established relating to Mr H’s international travel history. Records document a trip to Istanbul in April 2024, officially declared as a “heritage sightseeing” visit. However, intelligence indicated that he made attempts to attend gatherings in the city widely associated with radical Mars-based ideology groups. Although the defendant’s plans were disrupted by flight cancellations, such attempts at situating himself closer to affected regions remain pertinent to the assessment of motivation and risk.  

The furtherance of this evidence was painstaking and exacting. The Crown’s disclosure schedule grew over 600 exhibits, all requiring multi-agency vetting to protect sensitive intelligence sources. The court remarks parenthetically on the burden this places on judicial administration and acknowledges the professionalism of case officers involved.  

References have been made to co-defendants in separate proceedings linked to the same investigation, none of whom appear before this court and whose offences include offences unrelated to the present indictment, such as a conviction for burglary committed during a residential burglary in a different regional jurisdiction and the possession of illegal firearms. None of these co-defendant activities implicate Mr H directly. Further, one co-defendant was noted in agency reports to have failed to surrender for prosecution and remains at large.  

The present case, however, remains solely concerned with Mr H’s conduct. It is important to emphasise that offences committed by others—though part of the broader investigative picture—do not provide mitigation or aggravation in his sentencing. Courts must resist the temptation to conflate separate cases, a caution underscored in R v. Calderwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1627.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Debriefing from financial crime experts identified a cryptocurrency transaction trail involving the defendant. Approximately £1,900 was transferred from an anonymous wallet linked to Mr H’s pseudonymous accounts to a vendor specialised in acquiring dual-use chemical components. The use of tumblers and chain-hopping software to obfuscate transactions poses significant challenges to enforcement and highlights the evolving intersection of finance and terrorism.  

Additional peripheral observations include the presence of unrelated unpaid parking fines identified on the defendant’s records, as well as a number of minor traffic contraventions during 2022. Although raised during mitigation submissions as indicative of a disregard for administrative rules, such breaches are commonplace and bear no materiality to the seriousness of the offences before the court.  

The court has also been provided with logs of covert surveillance conducted by CTPWM agents. On 10 December 2024, Mr H was observed engaging in activity along the Aston Canal embankment, captured across multiple CCTV angles. The monitoring required significant technical expertise to reconcile distorted imaging and ambient conditions, an illustration of the operational difficulty in real-time threat monitoring. Though the observed behaviour was brief, its synchronisation with encrypted communications provided corroborative evidence to the prosecution.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to the defendant’s background, Mr H is 31 years old with an undergraduate degree in computer science obtained from a post-1992 university in the West Midlands. Employment history includes work as a junior software developer until an abrupt resignation in mid-2023, reportedly linked to an internal investigation into unauthorised use of company devices. His previous employer described him as “intelligent, focused but socially reticent.” Letters from former colleagues, while laudatory of his technical skills, cautioned against extrapolating these to character without reference to conduct.  

The defendant resides in rented accommodation in a working-class neighbourhood notable for high rates of social housing turnover and limited community cohesion. His landlord, while not directly involved in these proceedings, was subject to a noise abatement notice during 2023 after complaints by neighbours unrelated to Mr H but illustrating local environmental stressors.  

Further submissions referenced a psychological evaluation by Dr Yasmine Patel, a consultant forensic psychiatrist. Dr Patel’s report is thorough and professionally rendered, noting the defendant’s tendency towards “black-and-white thinking” but confirming the absence of a diagnosable psychotic disorder. The report highlights a significant risk of re-offending due to “unresolved ideological extremism if left unaddressed by structured interventions.” Defence proposals for engagement with the Home Office’s Desistance and Disengagement Programme are acknowledged but tempered with caution given completion statistics hovering at just under 60%.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

In concluding observations, the court must balance multiple factors: the gravity and sophistication of the defendant’s terrorist preparation, the level of planning evidenced by encrypted procurement and travel, the professional and personal background, and the mitigation rooted in lack of previous convictions and late guilty plea.  

This matter was listed for sentencing today following completion of the necessary reports and after full consideration of written and oral submissions on behalf of both the Crown and the defence. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the diligent advocacy of Ms Clara Wentworth KC for the Crown and Mr Josh Simmons, instructed on behalf of Mr H under a Legal Aid representation order. Their preparedness and professionalism reflect well upon the criminal justice system.  

The court directs that a pre-sentence report be compiled forthwith by the West Midlands Probation Service. Such a report should include a detailed risk assessment, with particular attention to the suitability and likely effectiveness of high-intensity cognitive behavioural programmes and monitoring by MAPPA on release. Consideration should also be given to potential conditions of licence, including electronic monitoring, restricted internet access, and mandatory participation in accredited disengagement schemes. I request feedback on the availability of suitable approved premises and access to structured psychological services during any period of custodial sentence imposed.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The hearing has been transcribed in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded in accordance with statutory obligations. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of sentencing. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
