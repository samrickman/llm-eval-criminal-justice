IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/32944  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. M. FAIRBROOK  
Filed: 16 September 2025

Mr H appears before this court for sentence having been convicted after trial on charges contrary to sections 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences principally concern conduct occurring between March 2023 and Mr H’s arrest in January 2025.

The defendant's case has been subject to numerous procedural stages since early 2025, including a contested pre-trial hearing on 17 April 2025, at which significant disputed disclosure issues were resolved. The adjournments occasioned by the COVID-19-induced delays to court operations should also be recorded—they have added a layer of complexity to the management of this matter, as has the sporadic industrial action affecting both court staff and judicial officers in the West Midlands Crown Court centre over the past six months.

In the course of the proceedings the court has been provided with extensive reports from Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM), forensic digital analysts, and an independent forensic accountant. These documents outline a broad and sophisticated investigative operation utilising a blend of traditional surveillance methods, intrusive cyber analysis, and multi-jurisdictional intelligence sharing. Particular commendation is due to Detective Chief Inspector Rowan Evans for his persistence in overseeing this investigation amidst competing demands on his unit. It is well-recognised, albeit scarcely remarked upon in public debate, that the resources allocated to counter-terrorism remain under intense strain as rising demand meets finite operational capacity.

Beyond the immediate ambit of this case, the court notes with some concern the documented pattern of rising antisocial behaviour in the city centre of Birmingham, as reported in the 2024 Annual Crime Statistics issued by the West Midlands Police Authority. Although unrelated to the defendant’s conduct, the polishing of CCTV infrastructure following a series of graffiti incidents on the Midland Metro line and the installation of new licensing conditions in night-time venues form part of the backdrop to the city’s broader public safety challenges. The unconnected arrest of a local man for affray during the October 2024 pub brawl between rival groups—resulting in serious injury to two bystanders—serves as a reminder of the manifold and varying dangers confronting enforcement agencies. These episodes, while peripheral, impinge on the overall operational climate faced by police officers tasked with the more high-profile investigations such as the present.

A further procedural note: the defendant was remanded in custody throughout the pre-trial period save for a brief interval in September 2024 when bail was granted subject to stringent conditions including electronic monitoring and a curfew from 9pm to 6am. Bail was subsequently revoked following an application by the prosecution predicated upon alarm arising from the discovery of additional encrypted devices during a follow-up warrants search executed in early November 2024.

The court is reminded that the genesis of modern terrorism legislation in the United Kingdom can be traced to the legislative reforms enacted under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974, albeit significantly augmented over the ensuing decades. This framework has evolved steadily, most recently in the form of the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019. Though not directly applicable here, an understanding of the historical underpinnings contextualises the current statutory provisions under which Mr H has been convicted.

In reviewing sentencing precedents, the court draws specific attention to R v. Bashir [2018] EWCA Crim 214, in which the Court of Appeal assessed the appropriate weight to be given to the possession of digital materials illustrating terrorist training manuals, emphasizing the categorisation of such possession not merely by the quantity of files involved but, more crucially, by the intended use and integration within wider preparatory activity. That case, alongside R v. Saeed [2020] EWCA Crim 557, underscores the judiciary’s recognition of the particular potency of digital communication in advancing terrorist aims and the resultant augmentation of culpability.

Whilst not bearing on mitigation, Mr H’s educational achievements merit mention. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics from the University of Warwick, awarded with upper second-class honours in 2018. Professional references tendered by former colleagues at a Birmingham-based engineering consultancy praise his technical competence, attention to detail, and reliability, though both his line manager and HR observed concerns arising from his sudden withdrawal from workplace social events and mounting absences beginning January 2023. No formal grievance or disciplinary proceedings ensued during his tenure.

The defendant’s personal history includes a protracted period of political disengagement from 2019 until mid-2022 when, according to a Channel panel referral dated August 2022, ideological concerns began to emerge. The Channel Case Management Panel’s documentation describes multi-agency attempts to engage Mr H in cognitive behavioural interventions, mentorship via community organisations, and referral to vocational re-training services—all of which were met with intermittent participation. Feedback from the Caldersfield Prevent Hub highlights both the complexity and ambiguity of counter-radicalisation efforts in cases where intrinsic motivation remains elusive. These attempts, whilst not halting the eventual offending, align with a model of intervention that stresses persistence over instant success.

Not unconnected to the broader theme of mental health services, the court notes an ongoing national challenge in securing timely assessments within forensic psychiatry. The East Midlands NHS Foundation Trust has advised that waiting lists for secure psychological evaluation can presently extend beyond six months for medium security facilities. Despite this, expert psychiatric and psychological evaluations in the present case were completed within four weeks of remand, reflecting efficient collaboration between agencies.

At the case management hearing of 28 March 2025 there was a note made on the court file referencing unavoidable interpreter service delays. Mr H’s preferred language being Urdu necessitated the use of a certified court-approved interpreter. On that occasion, the late arrival of the interpreter caused a 45-minute delay, emphasizing the quotidian operational frustrations faced by court officials and litigants alike.

Investigators have presented enduring challenges in the examination of recovered encrypted data, including partitioned digital 'volumes' accessed via provisional key recovery techniques. This case presented similar hurdles as encountered in R v. Barakat [2021] EWCA Crim 381, where the possession of partial instruction sets for improvised explosive devices was deemed sufficient to uphold intent, notwithstanding the incompleteness of physicalised materials. The difficulty inherent in forensic validation of encrypted storage continues to prompt debate on evidential standards.

A notable observation lies in the patterns of communication documented from the defendant’s devices, which include frequent references to a now-disbanded extremist network identified in intelligence assessments as “The Caledonian Initiative.” Notably, the network's public activity had ceased some two years prior to the defendant’s arrest, although archival fragments remained extant on darkweb platforms.

At the sentencing stage, the Crown invites the court to treat the reproduction of symbolic references to past atrocities as aggravating, arguing that the defendant’s online posts sought not only to memorialise but to incite. The defence, by contrast, characterise these posts as examples of the defendant’s distorted but misguided attempts at political commentary.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

Whilst the court acknowledges the relevance of such material to establishing intent and mindset, it must separate the defendant's actions from the broader genealogies of extremist literature. The proliferation of digital content presenting political violence in glamorised form—although widespread across many subcultures—cannot alone establish criminality absent demonstrable intent to effectuate harm. In this vein, R v. Sheikh [2019] EWCA Crim 1549 offered considered guidance on the evidential distinction between rhetorical extremism and preparatory conduct.

Further forensic analysis revealed the presence of video files depicting the construction of homemade mortars, with time-stamped modifications corresponding to dates shortly preceding covert surveillance observations of Mr H engaging in visits to industrial estates on the outskirts of Birmingham. These findings, supported by witness statements from manufacturing specialists employed nearby, contributed to establishing the depth of the preparation undertaken.

A remark from the defence that such materials might have been collected for academic or research purposes is not supported by accompanying contextual evidence. The court recalls, however, that a certain degree of intellectual curiosity regarding ordnance design features in many innocuous disciplines such as history of technology or chemistry.

The court notes that alongside the more incriminating digital artefacts, investigators retrieved several personal artefacts believed to relate to normal recreational pursuits, including a set of vintage vinyl records, a model railway set, and assorted botanical books. Such items offer little to no insight into criminality and invoke reminiscences of passing cultural fashions, albeit alien in a counter-terrorism investigation.

Equally tangential are the contemporaneous, though uncharged, allegations of noise nuisance lodged against the landlord of the property the defendant occupied. Complaints concern persistent late-night music and associated disturbances, yet no direct link has been established to the defendant himself. Similarly, local community forums have referenced sporadic incidents of antisocial behaviour in the neighbourhood, including unconnected fly-tipping and minor damage to public transportation signage. These occurrences, while indicative of broader social concerns, are distinctions unrelated to the present sentencing.

The defendant has no previous convictions for offences involving violence, possession of weapons, or public order breaches. It is noteworthy, however, that his former roommate was subject to police enquiry in 2022 following the discovery of a small quantity of cannabis during an unrelated search warrant; the defendant was not implicated or present at that time.

International travel records indicate that Mr H undertook a short visit to Lithuania in late 2023. The defence reports this trip was purely touristic, though it is recorded that on the day of arrival he made contact with an individual later revealed to have links to a prohibited organisation under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The Crown points to this as indicative of the defendant’s efforts to broaden operational networks.

It may be remarked that the process of inter-agency cooperation involving the Metropolitan Police Service and Europol played a decisive role in mapping this cross-border relationship. Such cooperation, however, is not always seamless. For example, a recent case involving a co-defendant on a related prosecution recorded procedural delays caused by administrative errors between national liaison points, resulting in the temporary loss of crucial forensic evidence.

Further procedural observation is made of the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of funding requests for expert evidence. The defence solicitor’s applications for psychiatric assessment were delayed by six weeks due to internal processing backlogs despite repeated follow-ups. This unfortunate trend of under-resourced support impairs the constitutional right to a fair trial and is a matter of continuing concern across the legal sector.

The defendant engaged the services of a forensic accountant specialising in cryptocurrency transactions. Her analysis traced a transfer of £3,500 to an unregulated exchange operating primarily through overseas servers. Such financial transactions, increasingly ubiquitous in criminal milieus, present complex investigatory challenges given the anonymisation techniques utilised.

The court reflects on the seminal guidance of R v. Eqar [2020] EWCA Crim 280 regarding the evidentiary threshold for establishing knowledge and intention in cases involving digital assets. Although cryptocurrency affords plausible deniability for defendants, the courts have displayed an increasing willingness to infer culpability from transactional patterns and contextual factors.

There is also an emerging phenomenon of so-called “crypto tumblers” or “mixers,” which obfuscate transaction trails through complex layering protocols. The operational difficulty faced by law enforcement agencies in unmasking terrorist financing networks amplified via such devices cannot be overstated.

In a separate development of no direct bearing on Mr H, the recent conviction of his former employer’s finance manager for embezzlement and benefit fraud necessitated unrelated audits and has drawn media attention due to the company’s regional prominence.

Personal mitigation material confirms that Mr H is a 30-year-old man of stable family background. Letters from his sister, Ms Rania Hashim, portray a younger brother trapped by isolation and ideology, recalling shared childhood experiences in Birmingham’s Lozells district. Ms Hashim’s correspondence, formally presented to the court by the defence solicitor, stresses the psychological pull of online echo chambers and the limited opportunities for reintegration he faced after redundancy from technical employment in late 2022.

The court has also received written submissions from the Black Country Resettlement Trust, which has offered support for Mr H’s continued engagement with vocational training and possible mentoring following release. While their intervention is commendable, one must guard against undue optimism in cases where prior efforts to disrupt extremist pathways have faltered.

Comparable community-based projects have encountered challenges, particularly given widespread public scepticism and fluctuating funding streams. For instance, the recently publicised collapse of the Midlands Youth Outreach Programme due to budgetary shortfalls leaves a vacuum in youth engagement efforts within the local area.

Expert psychiatric evidence presented by Dr Miriam Feldman confirms no formal diagnosis of mental disorder nor any indication of diminished responsibility. The report notes, however, the presence of “significant cognitive inflexibility and a propensity for dualistic moral reasoning,” which are identified as risk factors for entrenched extremist belief systems. The assessed risk of serious harm remains elevated absent substantial therapeutic engagement.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

It should be remarked that the 2023 Sentencing Council guidelines for terrorism set out a structured approach whereby factors such as the seriousness of intended harm, degree of planning, and potential for casualties must be carefully balanced against mitigating circumstances. The overarching principles emphasise public protection, deterrence, and the necessity of reflecting the gravity of offending.

Within that framework, the court acknowledges limited mitigating factors: the defendant’s lack of prior convictions, earlier steps to engage with community services, and eventual guilty plea—albeit entered late in proceedings after overwhelming evidence and at the threshold of trial.

This court must take a firm stance reflective of the seriousness of the offences and the tangible threat posed by the defendant's planning and preparations. The presence of materials indicative of explosive manufacturing, combined with the defendant’s deliberate efforts to obscure communication channels and use cryptocurrency to finance further activities, significantly elevate culpability.

I direct that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared with particular attention to Mr H’s rehabilitation prospects, risk of reoffending, and suitability for participation in focused deradicalisation and cognitive-behavioural programmes. The Probation Service is also asked to assess housing stability, access to vocational training, and psychological support arrangements.

The court also wishes to place on record its appreciation for the work of all agencies involved in the investigation and prosecution of this case, including Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service, and the Digital Forensics Unit of the West Midlands Police. Despite resource pressures and competing priorities, their diligent efforts have been exemplary.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 September 2025, in Court 11 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for registration.

These are the orders of the court.
