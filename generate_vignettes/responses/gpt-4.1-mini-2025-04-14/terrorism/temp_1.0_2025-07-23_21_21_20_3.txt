IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/28841  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge F. J. WHITMORE  
Filed: 17 October 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts under the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct is said to have occurred between January 2023 and the date of his arrest in March 2025.  

It is necessary at the outset to remark upon the procedural history that has preceded today’s hearing. The case was first allocated to this Crown Court on 5 May 2025, following the conclusion of preliminary investigations by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM) and the approval of charges by the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter Terrorism Unit. There were multiple administrative delays occasioned by an unprecedented backlog of forensic analyses and a notable scarcity of qualified examiners specialising in encrypted data. Such pressures have, regrettably, become commonplace in modern counter-terrorism investigations, as forensic laboratories struggle to balance the breadth of material requiring examination against constrained staffing levels and limited funding streams. This case was no exception, involving, as it did, the review of several terabytes of encrypted communications and related digital evidence.  

In the interim, the court has been mindful of the constitutional imperatives attaching to the defendant’s liberty while balancing the state’s duty to protect the public from serious harm. Mr H was initially remanded in custody but was granted conditional bail following a hearing on 15 August 2025. Conditions included stringent reporting requirements, electronic curfew monitoring, and restrictions on internet access. The latter condition, while a reasonable precaution, has presented challenges to counsel in communication with their client but remains a necessary measure given the risk profile.  

The court also records the somewhat fraught experience with the Legal Aid Agency in granting funding for independent expert psychiatric assessment. The original application took eight weeks to resolve, with initial queries requiring additional documentation and repeated follow-up correspondence by the defence. Timescales such as this, though dismaying, are sadly not atypical in high-security cases involving sensitive material and multiple agencies. Whilst the court does not intend to cast aspersions, it must be acknowledged that such bureaucratic delays have the potential to hinder the timely progression of justice and pose difficulties for defendants in preparing an appropriately informed mitigation case.  

The authorities and the defence have been most courteous in their submissions today. I record my appreciation for the clear and focused advocacy displayed by Miss Eleanor Bainbridge for the Crown and Mr Oswald Herring appearing for the defendant. Both counsel have presented detailed skeleton arguments, to which the court has given careful consideration in the course of these remarks. The courtroom setting, recently refurbished with upgraded closed-circuit television monitors and enhanced sound systems, has facilitated the smooth conduct of proceedings, despite intermittent connectivity issues with remote witness links. The court also thanks the court ushers and staff for their professionalism in managing the complex video and document bundles presented at trial.  

It is necessary to contextualise these proceedings within the broader framework of contemporary counter-terrorism law. The offences charged derive from legislation enacted in the wake of the Terrorism Act 2000 and periodically updated by the 2006 Act amendments. These statutes are designed to confer upon law enforcement and prosecutors enhanced powers to disrupt the preparatory stages of terrorism with a view to preventing harm before it occurs. This preventative legislative posture requires courts to grapple with evidence that is often inferential, technical, and, at times, fragmentary. It is a delicate balance, demanding careful judicial scrutiny while recognising the inherently secretive nature of terrorist planning.  

The Crown’s case proceeded to a judge-alone trial after the defendant waived his entitlement to a jury trial on 12 September 2025. This decision was influenced, reportedly, by concerns relating to the potential prejudicial effect of extensive classified material, partially the subject of closed-material procedures under the Justice and Security Act 2013. The court again acknowledges the painstaking work undertaken in this delicate balancing act of protecting national security and ensuring fairness.  

The issue of credit for the plea must be approached with due attention to relevant precedents. As affirmed in the Court of Appeal decision in R v. Middleton [2024] EWCA Crim 1891, mere acceptance of guilt on the eve of sentencing yields a very limited discount, particularly where the Crown has mobilised considerable preparatory work and witness instruction. Further, the Court reaffirmed in R v. Sutherland [2023] EWCA Crim 1010 that early pleas materially reduce the impact on court time and the distress caused to victims and witnesses, a benefit that is proportionately reflected in the sentencing exercise.  

It is also instructive to consider developments in the sentencing guidelines governing terrorism offences, most recently updated by the Sentencing Council in early 2023. The Guidelines emphasize core factors such as the offender’s level of commitment, operational sophistication, and the proximity in time or space to potential acts of terrorism. Mitigating features, including previous good character, genuine remorse, and participation in disengagement programmes, are weighed carefully but must be balanced against the serious and far-reaching consequences of terrorist conduct.  

Prior to detailing the facts underpinning the conviction, it is regrettable but necessary to highlight an unrelated matter of prosecutorial chronology. The trial was adjourned twice owing to the non-appearance of a crucial witness from an overseas jurisdiction, who was instrumental in decoding encrypted communications recovered. These delays were exacerbated by ongoing international travel restrictions and diplomatic protocols. While frustrating, such procedural inconveniences are not uncommon in cases transnational by design.  

Turning now to the facts of the case:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

The investigation, code-named Operation STEADFAST, was initiated following receipt of intelligence from the Security Service concerning encrypted communications on platforms associated with known extremist entities. The suspicious activity initially centred on Mr H’s electronic correspondence, including messages exchanged with overseas contacts. These exchanges included references to documents classified under international terrorism watchlists. The subsequent police operation involved specialist officers from CTPWM, forensic accountants assisting with blockchain analysis, and cyber investigators tasked with device extraction and content recovery. The operation was conducted within the parameters of statute, including judicial warrants authorising intrusive surveillance and data interception.  

It is worthwhile to reflect upon the often underappreciated human diligence behind such technological investigations. Analysts and officers alike laboured extensive hours sifting through encrypted traffic and fragmented metadata, contending with incomplete downloads and device encryption that required bespoke decryption efforts. Such work is emblematic of the painstaking, often operationally opaque nature of counter-terrorism policing in the modern world.  

In the course of this inquiry, the prosecution elicited evidence from Ms Judith Reynolds, a forensic data analyst employed by the West Midlands Police Cybercrime Unit. Ms Reynolds’ testimony outlined the technical challenges of accessing hidden volumes within encrypted containers, particularly those masked with user-generated complex passwords. Her expert account was instrumental in establishing the provenance and timing of encrypted file creation, lending credence to the Crown’s timeline of preparatory conduct.  

As background, it is worth mentioning that the victim impact in cases of this nature is frequently diffuse, encompassing society en masse rather than identifiable individual complainants. Nonetheless, victim liaison officers working with local communities reported elevated anxiety and disruption following the exposure of the defendant’s activities, illustrating the pervasive reach and societal consequences of terrorism offences.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

The court is reminded, from the academic and jurisprudential perspective, of the importance of assessed risk and rehabilitation in sentencing. The Probation Service submitted a comprehensive pre-sentence report highlighting Mr H’s complex psychological and social factors. The dossier was supported by a clinical evaluation from Dr Lionel McCormick, a forensic psychiatrist with extensive experience in ideological extremism cases. Dr McCormick’s report detailed Mr H’s cognitive inflexibility, expressed grievances relating to perceived institutional injustices, and identified elevated risk indicators for recidivism without focused intervention.  

The defence solicitors tendered letters from family members and local religious organisations attesting to Mr H’s past good character and transient employment history, as well as his purported desire to disassociate from extremist beliefs. Correspondence from the Birmingham Interfaith Council advocates for community-based reintegration programmes and cautions against overly punitive sentencing that may exacerbate alienation. The court has diligently considered these materials but remains mindful that public protection must be a paramount concern.  

There have been several submissions concerning co-defendants in related prosecutions who faced separate charges of aiding and abetting. Among those, one co-defendant was convicted of importing wholesale quantities of Class A drugs concealed in commercial freight, a charge unrelated to Mr H’s case but occasionally referenced in Crown submissions to illustrate the spectrum of criminal enterprises intersecting with terrorism networks. The court emphasises that such charges are extraneous here and carry no bearing on the defendant’s culpability or sentence.  

It is also pertinent to note that the defendant’s local probation officer is currently subject to unrelated disciplinary proceedings involving allegations of misconduct in a non-terrorism case. While unfortunate, there is no credible evidence that this has impacted the current supervision or assessment provided in this matter.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The possession of sophisticated materials recovered in Mr H’s possession indicates a degree of technical competence and intent to utilise resources toward violent ends. This court draws guidance from R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which affirmed that possession for terrorist purposes includes preparatory possession aligned with attack planning, even if the attempt is foiled before fruition.  

The defendant’s use of encrypted platforms and anonymisation tools aligns with a growing trend whereby offenders seek to evade detection through increasingly sophisticated cyber measures. It is an industry-wide challenge for law enforcement that such tools, while serving legitimate privacy interests for many citizens, can be exploited for nefarious ends. The judiciary must balance the protection of civil liberties with the necessity of effective counter-terrorism measures.  

The various encrypted archives included instructions and diagrams consistent with those used in other prosecutions for the manufacture of improvised explosive devices, as documented in R v. Amir [2022] EWCA Crim 798. Despite the complex technology employed, the essential facts of intent remain clear through context and circumstantial evidence.  

In considering mitigation, one must acknowledge that Mr H has no previous convictions for any offence. While this is plainly relevant, it can scarcely offset the gravity of the current matters. The court is conscious of the contrast between youthful indiscretions, such as the shoplifting of toiletries and alcohol by one co-defendant, and the deliberate planning of indiscriminate violence. The former might attract community sentences; the latter demands custodial containment.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

It is worth pausing to consider the strains on public services occasioned by cases of this nature. The local healthcare trust’s mental health services have signalled significant delays in access, with waiting lists for psychological risk assessments reaching unprecedented lengths. This affects both the prompt preparation of reports and the availability of intervention programmes. Similarly, probation services face chronic understaffing, which invariably impacts the quality and intensity of supervision available post-sentence.  

The court also notes correspondence from the local housing authority, which highlighted increased homelessness in the area, including among vulnerable individuals with known ideological extremisms. While not directly linked to Mr H, the phenomenon is symptomatic of wider societal challenges affecting community safety and cohesion. Such systemic factors, though outside the court’s remit, nevertheless form part of the tapestry within which these offences occur.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Turning back to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years of age, educated to degree level in electronic engineering, with prior employment as a junior systems analyst until his redundancy in late 2022. Character references describe him as “quiet but courteous,” with volunteer work for a community food bank. However, these positive facets cannot reasonably be allowed to eclipse the gravity of the offences now before the court.  

During the investigation, a trip Mr H made in July 2024 to a conference on “Emerging Technologies and Security” in Berlin was scrutinised. Although characterised by the defence as a legitimate professional exercise, it coincided with a side visit to a region known for extremist gatherings, raising legitimate suspicion. CCTV evidenced interactions with individuals later convicted for offences unrelated to Mr H, including fly-tipping on protected green-belt land and involvement in unlicensed firearms trading. These ancillary matters, though of interest in the wider investigation, are entirely disconnected from Mr H’s conduct and do not bear on his sentencing.  

The court recalls the ruling in R v. Calderwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1627 on the necessity of distinguishing factual matrices in assessing culpability and sentence credit. The conduct of unrelated defendants or co-participants—while relevant to their cases—must not distort the assessment of the individual before the court.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial investigations revealed transfers through cryptocurrency wallets linked to the defendant, including a payment of approximately 1.25 Bitcoin to an obscure marketplace on the dark web known for offering dual-use materials. This underlines the transnational nature of the threat and the challenges faced by authorities in tracing and disrupting illicit transaction chains. The increasing sophistication of such financial instruments complicates efforts to curb the financing of terrorist activities and emphasizes the need for legislative adaptability and resourcing.  

The court is mindful of Defence Counsel’s submissions highlighting Mr H’s expressed willingness to engage with deradicalisation programmes post-release, including the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) offered by the West Midlands Prevent Hub. While participation is acknowledged as a positive step, the court is bound to observe that such schemes are not guaranteed undertakings and have varied efficacy, especially where underlying ideological commitment remains firm. The judiciary must resist unwarranted optimism when contemplating risk management strategies.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Psychiatric assessment by Dr Samantha Lowe found no diagnosable mental illness but noted a high degree of cognitive rigidity and a tendency toward dichotomous thinking patterns. The risk assessment concluded a high likelihood of serious harm absent rigorous supervision. The report was detailed, professionally written, and included consideration of relevant differential diagnoses and comorbidities. It confirmed that the defendant presents a continuing risk that requires sustained, structured intervention beyond simple custodial confinement.  

The court is aware of the service pressures within the NHS and acknowledges the valiant efforts of forensic mental health professionals who endeavour to deliver assessments in this complex and politically sensitive domain. The expanding remit of forensic psychiatry—to encompass ideological extremism as a component of risk assessment—demands multidisciplinary expertise and ongoing professional development, areas currently subject to examination within health service funding reviews.  

The defendant’s family have submitted a letter claiming a history of childhood adversity, including experiences of neglect and social isolation. While the court has regard to such matters, they do not excuse nor justify planning for indiscriminate violence. Childhood trauma is, regrettably, a common thread in numerous offending profiles but remains a factor to be weighed alongside personal agency and adult choices.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

In conclusion, this was a meticulously planned and executed enterprise by a defendant with sufficient technical skill and ideological commitment to pose a grave threat to public safety. His conduct sits firmly within the highest culpability category set out in the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines. The careful encryption, sustained preparatory actions, and intention to facilitate indiscriminate harm represent significant aggravating features.  

Mitigating factors are scant, limited to absence of antecedents, educational achievements, and a guilty plea entered late in the proceedings. Accordingly, such plea attracts limited credit, insufficient to materially diminish the appropriate custodial demand. The court notes the defendant’s expressed desire for rehabilitation and disengagement but rightly treats these with cautious pragmatism pending evidence of genuine reform.  

The court will order the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report to assess the suitability of sentence options including, but not limited to, Extended Determinate Sentences with licence conditions incorporating electronic monitoring and mandatory participation in evidenced-based deradicalisation programmes. The report is also to address the feasibility of approved premises accommodation equipped for high-risk offenders and any requisite psychological interventions to accompany such an order.  

This case epitomises the increasingly complex interplay between technologically sophisticated crime, ideological extremism, and the limits of conventional justice frameworks. The court must impose a sentence sufficient to mark society’s condemnation, deter others, and protect the public, while allowing for the potential of rehabilitation within tightly controlled parameters.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 11 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence shall be forwarded to the relevant authorities for registration and enforcement.  

These are the orders of the court.
