IN THE CROWN COURT AT HACKNEY  
R v. MR H  
Case No. H2025/14728  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. B. Cleary  
Filed: 17 August 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction on a representative count of theft, specifically shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The conduct spans a protracted period between October 2023 and April 2025 and primarily affected small-to-medium retail establishments within the Hackney borough and adjoining districts.

Procedural History and Preliminary Observations  
The genesis of this prosecution lies in an initiative undertaken by the Hackney Retail Crime Partnership—a coalition consisting of local police units, council enforcement officers, and representatives from affected business owners. This partnership's stated aim is to combat rising instances of shop theft, an issue that, while often diminished in public discourse as trivial, imposes tangible costs on shopkeepers, employees, and by extension, the community at large.

The investigation into your actions commenced in earnest on 8 February 2025, following a series of complaints backed by video surveillance and loss-prevention reports. It is critical to recognise that such investigations are not undertaken lightly. Rather, they require the coalescence of multi-agency collaboration, resource allocation, and hours of painstaking review of often low-quality footage. Officers routinely face the unenviable task of piecing together fragmented visual data, aligning it with witness accounts, and navigating the complexities of data protection and evidential protocols.

You were arrested on 20 April 2025 and interviewed under caution. Initially, you denied the allegations, but forensic analysis of clothing and footwear recovered from your residence corresponded closely with images circulated by retail partners. Your eventual acceptance of guilt came only after substantial evidential compilation and pre-court disclosure.

It is regrettable, though unsurprising, that your guilty plea was entered at the eleventh hour, late in the process and shortly before trial. The Court of Appeal in R v. Delaney [2023] EWCA Crim 1567 has reiterated that while credit for a plea remains at the court’s discretion, the timing and frankly tactical nature of a plea entered at such a stage must temper the amount of credit offered. The courts must balance the imperative of rewarding genuine remorse against the significant costs borne by victims, witnesses, and the justice system when cases are contested—only to result in last-minute admissions.

The Hardship and Burden of Investigations  
The investigative protocols deployed in your case drew upon a range of modern policing techniques, including the collation of CCTV from multiple retail partners and the utilisation of data-sharing platforms such as the Urban Retail Intelligence Network, which aims to identify serial offenders through behavioural pattern analysis. This multi-faceted approach represents a considerable investment in intelligence-led policing, designed to focus scarce resources effectively. Nonetheless, it carries a cumulatively significant public expense—not merely in financial terms but also in operational opportunity cost. As expert witnesses on police resourcing have observed, prolonged investigations into so-called “low-harm” offences frequently divert capacity from critical areas such as violent crime units or child protection services.

The court also notes, with recognition, the continuing work of the Hackney Shopkeepers’ Association, whose frontline members have consistently demonstrated resilience despite frequent adverse interactions with persistent offenders. Their submissions, while unable to participate directly today, have been made available to the court and reveal the psychological wear endured by retail employees tasked with the unenviable role of confronting and apprehending offenders without formal training or support beyond basic conflict resolution workshops.

This court continues to monitor the evolving relationship between local authorities and voluntary organisations aimed at mitigating acquisitive crime, including the nascent Hackney Community Theft Diversion Scheme, which seeks to provide early intervention through housing support and skills development. While the effectiveness of such programmes varies and depends heavily on uptake, they represent a promising avenue for reducing reoffending rates and therefore merit mention.

The Legal Aid Agency’s Role and Challenges  
It would be remiss not to highlight the procedural difficulties experienced when attempting to obtain funding for independent expert assessment in this matter. Mr H’s defence team made an application on 4 May 2025 for approval of a forensic psychological evaluation to explore underlying factors contributing to the offending pattern. The Legal Aid Agency—whose role in ensuring equal access to justice is nonetheless vital—took until 16 June 2025 to grant that authority. This delay disrupted case management timetables and further impeded the timely resolution of the proceedings.

Regrettably, such delays are far from exceptional. Similar concerns have been raised in recent Justice Committee reports, noting that the Agency’s procedural frameworks, while designed to ensure oversight, frequently function as inadvertent barriers to cost-efficient case progression. This is particularly damaging in cases like yours, where timely evaluation might have facilitated more tailored community interventions and potentially averted custodial outcomes.

Sentencing Context and Case Law Considerations  
The statutory framework applicable here is well established. Theft offenders fall to be sentenced under the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft and similar offences, published in January 2022, which emphasises assessment of harm, culpability, and mitigation.

The monetary value of the property stolen in your case, while relatively modest when measured per incident, exhibits a cumulative magnitude which cannot be ignored. Nor can the intangible effect on staff morale and the broader local economy be dismissed. The frequent targeting of essential goods and over-the-counter medicines magnifies local harm in ways that transcend mere financial calculation.

The court has taken into account relevant appellate authorities, including R v. Garnett [2021] EWCA Crim 1730, which underscored that repeat offending, especially when conducted with the use of planning and concealment methods, justifies enhanced sentencing weight. Likewise, R v. Morris [2020] EWCA Crim 1192 affirmed the importance of considering the impact on staff and the disruption to legitimate business activities as aggravating factors.

Although outside the present factual matrix, the court has also reflected on R v. Whittle [2019] EWCA Crim 2045, pertaining to offences of affray following a violent public altercation involving pool cues at a licensed premises. While wholly distinct from the current proceedings, Whittle serves as a reminder of the justice system's wide remit and the necessity of tailoring sanctions to the specifics of each case. Furthermore, the case highlighted the utility of immediate custodial sentences in circumstances where public confidence in law and order is undermined by reckless behaviour.

The breadth of criminal offences considered by appellate courts over recent years impresses upon this court the diversity of threats to public safety. Whether the running of unlicensed waste disposal sites (as in R v. Linstead [2022] EWCA Crim 1456) or the smuggling of narcotics concealed in vehicle compartments (R v. Haslow [2021] EWCA Crim 1754), the judiciary must calibrate punishment to risk, harm, and societal expectations.

Facts of the Offending  
The facts of the case are as follows:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

Throughout the period in question, you exhibited a repeated pattern of behaviour characterised by calculated selection of high-demand commodities and exploitation of moments during staff shift changes or when attention was diverted elsewhere in the store environment. Evidence shows you engaged in the concealment of such items within clothing or personal effects, sometimes removing security tags by force or manipulation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

You wore distinctive apparel noted in multiple recorded incidents, which formed a key part of the surveillance evidence. Behavioural analysts have observed your use of feigned telephone conversations to distract store employees, as well as employing modified bags designed to shield concealed items from detection.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Staff at one affected pharmacy reduced opening hours and deployed two-person teams during busy periods as a direct response to the anxiety generated by your repeated visits. Statements describe an atmosphere of fear and diminished job satisfaction, with at least one employee requesting a transfer to a different store.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Despite warnings from community liaison officers and incursions of out-of-court disposals in prior years, notably in 2021 and 2022, there was a clear recurrence of similar offending behaviour, which persisted unmitigated until your arrest.

Expert Reports and Risk Assessments  
The court has considered the detailed psychiatric evaluation prepared by Dr Susan Hawthorne, a consultant forensic psychologist with a specialism in repeat acquisitive offending and behavioural health. Dr Hawthorne’s report, dated 29 July 2025, finds no evidence of a major mental illness, but identifies features suggestive of emotional dysregulation, situational impulsivity, and a mild level of dependence on alcohol. Critically, the report remarks on your demonstrable reluctance to engage with available support services, despite numerous referral attempts made by probation and community outreach teams.  

This report elaborates: “The client presents with a complex pattern of risk behaviours intertwined with socio-economic stressors, but a pattern of avoidance of therapeutic engagement hinders efforts to achieve meaningful intervention.”  

The Probation Service pre-sentence report echoes these conclusions, highlighting that while your motivation appears linked to financial instability and housing insecurity, your attempts to access assistance have been sporadic and largely ineffective. The probation officer notes that waiting times for access to mental health counselling within the local NHS framework exceed six months—a challenge common across urban centres—but stresses that your case is complicated by your failure to pursue earlier offered alternatives, including third-sector addiction services and budgeting workshops.

In my experience, these patterns are sadly not unusual. There remains a chasm between the support available—in principle—and the extent to which those in need engage with it in practice. This gap results in sustained pressure on emergency accommodation services and the justice system alike.

While I acknowledge the mitigating relevance of your socio-economic condition, exacerbated by systemic shortfalls in public services, these circumstances do not diminish personal responsibility. The law requires a balance between compassion and accountability.

General Observations on Context and Public Safety  
The court notes the wider context within which acquisitive crime occurs today. National data indicates a worrying upward trajectory in shoplifting offences, coinciding with economic austerity measures and inflationary pressures. According to figures presented by Ms Jennifer Collins, a criminal intelligence analyst at the Metropolitan Police Service, recorded retail theft rose by nearly 14% between 2022 and 2024 across London boroughs, with disproportionately high rates in disadvantaged areas.

The complex interplay between social deprivation, substance misuse, and opportunity for crime frequently manifests in cases such as this. It is tempting to view individual offending as symptomatic of broken communities or fractured social support. Yet, as this court has underscored in past decisions, notably in R v. Fairbanks [2018] EWCA Crim 1293, such contextual factors inform but do not excuse. The rule of law demands that those who transgress—even in hardship—be held to account equally.

Moreover, public confidence rests not merely on sanctions but on the visible consistency and fairness of justice. Retail workers, small business owners, and customers alike are entitled to expect that theft does not go unpunished or unaddressed. It is notable that the courts approach petty crime with measured gravity precisely because of its wider effect on community cohesion and perceived social order.

The court also wishes to register appreciation for the efforts of the Hackney Victim Support Service, which provided comprehensive victim impact statements reflecting the experienced distress and economic loss sustained by retailers and employees. Their balanced analysis highlights the intersection of personal trauma and wider financial consequence.

Sentencing Approach and Future Directions  
The Sentencing Council guidelines urge courts to consider repeated offending as an aggravating feature warranting escalation of sentence severity. Persistent acquisitive conduct, marked by evident planning and disregard for prior warnings, exhibits considerable culpability.

Although you ultimately pleaded guilty, the lateness of your plea limits the extent of discount available. Your decision delayed final resolution and prolonged the anxious waiting period for victims and witnesses. As the Court of Appeal stated in R v. Pittman [2024] EWCA Crim 901, the timing of a plea directly influences sentencing credit and reflects the offender’s acceptance of responsibility.

The court is, however, cognisant of your personal circumstances, including housing instability and limited employment history. It is a lamentable reality that access to stable accommodation and meaningful opportunity remains elusive for many. These matters will inform the content and recommendation of the forthcoming pre-sentence report. The probation officer will be asked to consider the applicability of tailored interventions, including cognitive behavioural programmes focused on impulse control and acquisitive offending, as well as supported pathways addressing alcohol misuse.

The court looks favourably upon interventions that encompass restorative justice elements where feasible, in recognition of the potential for victim-offender mediation to alleviate some of the harm. It is also recommended that, where capacity allows, debt management and budgeting support be integrated into any community-based disposal. The probation service may wish to liaise with local charity organisations such as Hackney Community Outreach and the London Poverty & Gambling Support Network, who offer specialised assistance in these domains.

Finally, though unrelated to you personally, it is of passing note that one of your former flatmates is undergoing separate proceedings relating to unconnected cannabis possession, a matter that the CPS has advised carries no direct bearing upon your case.

Conclusion  
I shall therefore defer sentence to permit the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, which shall take into account the totality of the circumstances—including securable risk, mitigation, and prospects for rehabilitation.

I thank Ms Fiona McCandless, who appears for the Crown, and Mr James Wright for the defence, acting under a Legal Aid representation order. Despite the Agency’s administrative hurdles, their professionalism has been exemplary in securing your rights.

The court is grateful to Court Staff for their assistance today. I acknowledge that the hearing room in Hackney Crown Court was recently refurbished to improve accessibility and comfort for all participants—a welcome development that reflects the judiciary’s commitment to inclusion.
