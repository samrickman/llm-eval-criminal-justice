IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/04561  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. L. FLETCHER  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence on a charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge represents a course of conduct involving repeated shoplifting from multiple retail premises located across the Greater Manchester area over the course of approximately two years.

Procedural History  
The prosecution arises following an investigation initiated by the Greater Manchester Police Retail Crime Unit, prompted by reports submitted from the local Business Crime Reduction Panel, which coordinated intelligence from several independent retailers and larger chain stores. The initial reports, dating from mid-2023, detailed a series of thefts from stores in the Wythenshawe, Didsbury, and Chorlton districts—areas characterised by a mix of residential and commercial developments. Although the offences were low value individually, the cumulative effect on retailers and their staff was significant, particularly given the frequency of offending and the perceived brazenness of certain incidents.  

The investigation benefitted from the use of closed-circuit television footage, store receipt reconciliations, and statements from witnesses, which slowly pieced together a pattern of repeat offending. Notably, during the investigative period there was also engagement with local volunteer-run outreach services, which sought to offer support for those at risk of entering the criminal justice system owing to socioeconomic vulnerabilities. The Safer Neighbourhoods Team liaised closely with the retail business proprietors and community groups to document the incidents and to assess the broader impact.  

It is important to note that while the current charge relates to the Theft Act offence, ancillary agencies were also alerted to issues of concern connected, though not exclusive, to Mr H’s circumstances. Outreach reports noted erratic housing tenure and intermittent engagement with support services. The Probation Service submitted an early report flagging these vulnerabilities alongside the challenges in engaging such individuals in a meaningful manner.  

You were arrested on 22 August 2025 following the execution of a warrant at an address in Hulme. The arrest was the result of sustained intelligence-gathering operations, including mobile phone data analysis authorized by warrants issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Such operational activity, while resource intensive, reflects the contemporary policing approach to serial retail theft, which prioritises not only investigative efficiency but also victim safeguarding and broader public confidence.  

Initial interview under caution was conducted promptly by trained officers specialising in acquisitive crime. While you initially denied involvement, the substantial evidential package presented included footage matched with possessions found following a lawful search. A formal charge was brought on 29 August 2025.  

The case was transferred to this Crown Court unit under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme, a framework designed to expedite prosecution of serious and complex matters. Several procedural listings were held, including a plea and trial preparation hearing on 10 September. At that hearing, you entered a guilty plea to the representative count.

It must be added that the court is acutely aware of the cumulative pressures faced by retail staff and law enforcement alike in confronting acquisitive offending. The apparent increase in such offences has been noted in national statistics and discussed in parliamentary debates. The window for resolution offered by the BCM process aims to balance efficiency with fairness, but challenges inevitably arise — including competing case priorities, resource limitations, and the precarity of vulnerable witnesses whose attendance may be unpredictable.  

The court is furthermore cognisant of a recent investigation led by the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service into an unrelated incident of arson in a commercial unit proximate to one of the locations associated with the present offences. This earlier case, involving significant damage caused by deliberately set fire to storage units containing flammable materials, resulted in extended court proceedings and multiple trial dates. In contrast, I note that the current matter has not suffered from similar disruption or delay, notwithstanding the increasingly congested Crown Court schedules exacerbated by staff shortages and industrial action.  

The Law and Sentencing Framework  
The legal principles governing theft under the Theft Act 1968 are well established. Section 1 sets out that an individual is guilty of theft if they dishonestly appropriate property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it. The multiplicity and deliberateness of repeated shoplifting offending elevate its seriousness beyond isolated incidents.  

Sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council for theft offences emphasise factors such as persistence, planning, targeting of vulnerable victims, breach of trust, and impact on victims and communities. Although the offending here does not involve violence or threats, the psychological and economic effect on store staff and owners is material.  

The Court of Appeal has provided further guidance on credit for guilty pleas in acquisitive crime matters. In R v. Keeley [2023] EWCA Crim 1355, the court drew attention to the importance of early admissions, noting that “credit for a plea will be curtailed where that plea is made only when the evidence becomes overwhelming.” While it is always legitimate to test the Crown’s case, the court must ensure credit is proportionate to the timing and sincerity of the plea.  

In R v. Milford [2021] EWCA Crim 784, the appellate court upheld a custodial sentence imposed for repeated theft from charity shops, stressing that offences against such community-oriented businesses attract higher culpability. This reflects the broader societal interest in protecting goodwill-based enterprises, which rely heavily on public trust and volunteer labour. Though this matter concerns multiple retail formats, the principle of heightened scrutiny applies equally where repeated breaches demonstrate flagrant disregard for social norms.  

Turning to R v. Stanton [2020] EWCA Crim 2154, that case concerned a course of behaviour involving trespass and criminal damage to railway infrastructure—specifically theft of copper cabling causing network disruption and posing safety risks. The Court of Appeal emphasised the danger posed to public utilities and the community by thefts with wider ramifications. While the instant case involves shoplifting rather than infrastructure theft, the principle that acquisitive offences can undermine public confidence and safety remains salient.

It would be remiss not to mention the case of R v. Denham [2022] EWCA Crim 683, concerning possession of offensive weapons in a school car park. The court there underscored the gravity associated with offences in sensitive locations and the associated risk of harm. Although such weapons offences fall outside the present facts, the case serves as a judicial reminder of the broad spectrum of criminal conduct encountered by the courts, highlighting how contextual considerations inform sentencing.

I note with some disquiet that the Legal Aid Agency continues to experience grave difficulties in processing timely applications in this jurisdiction. In this case, the defence’s efforts to secure funding for psychiatric and social work assessments encountered avoidable delays of two months, despite the clear procedural urgency. Such systemic inefficiencies strain all participants in the justice system, increasing workloads and undermining public confidence.  

Similarly, the Probation Service faces chronic understaffing, which hampers delivery of vital pre-sentence reports. Those reports assist courts in calibrating rehabilitative efforts and public protection measures. Current constraints reduce the scope and depth of assessments, adversely affecting justice outcomes. The court emphasises that robust probation engagement is a critical component of a proportionate sentencing process.

Reference should also be made to the established role of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership model across Greater Manchester. Intended to facilitate inter-agency collaboration, intelligence-sharing, and strategic deployment of resources, this model has been heralded in policy circles as an exemplar of coordinated response to acquisitive crime. However, operational realities remain challenging. Information exchange protocols vary between stakeholders, and teams face frequent resourcing shortfalls.

Furthermore, some voluntary sector organisations operating within the community dungeon have reported consistent underfunding, limiting their capacity to offer wraparound services including financial advice, crisis accommodation, and addiction support. Such limitations inevitably feed into the broader social matrix within which offending occurs.

Victim Impact and Community Considerations  
Victim impact statements have been obtained from affected retailers. They describe not only financial loss but also stress, anxiety, and depletion of workplace morale. Several employees reported feeling compelled to partake in additional security duties, leading to extended hours and fatigue. The psychological impact, though less visible than physical harm, is acute and enduring.

The court also recognizes the importance of safeguarding the environment within which shop staff operate, especially in independent stores which lack the corporate support of national chains. The closure of local amenities due to persistent shrinkage has been linked to community decline and social isolation in some deprived areas.

I note correspondence received from the Manchester City Neighborhood Watch Association. While not directly connected to your offending, these representatives express concern about the accumulation of petty acquisitive crime in their areas and the knock-on effects on community cohesion.

Approaches to Rehabilitation and Mitigation  
A psychiatric report was commissioned on behalf of the defence and prepared by Dr Marianne Lowther, Consultant Clinical Psychologist. Dr Lowther concluded that while there is no diagnosable major mental illness, there is clear evidence of impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and heightened anxiety associated with unstable accommodation. The report also highlights mild substance misuse issues relating to alcohol and prescribed medication, likely exacerbating difficulties in judgement and impulse control.

While these factors may provide some context for the offending, I must emphasize that awareness of personal vulnerabilities does not exempt one from accountability. The court is frequently reminded that many individuals experiencing similar challenges nonetheless avoid criminal conduct and engage proactively with available support services.

The pre-sentence report, prepared by Probation Officer Emily Harding, corroborates these findings and notes limited engagement with community support initiatives despite multiple offers of assistance. The assessment indicates medium risk of reoffending and points to the need for a structured intervention programme, ideally incorporating cognitive skills training and financial management support.

The defence counsel, Mr Richard Evans, has submitted letters from local outreach providers and charities outlining steps taken to encourage Mr H’s involvement with practical and therapeutic services. The judge acknowledges the persistence and commitment of these organisations, which operate in a landscape marked by funding shortfalls, high case loads, and overstretched personnel.

It is worth reflecting that many of these bodies rely substantially on volunteer labour, who provide critical front-line assistance in contexts where public sector provisions are insufficient. Their role extends to advocacy, crisis intervention, and bridging gaps between statutory services and isolated individuals. Their contributions warrant formal acknowledgment.

The Arguments on Sentence  
The prosecution, represented by Ms Laura Grant, submits that the cumulative seriousness of the repeated offences, coupled with the lack of meaningful engagement with available support and previous criminal history, warrants a custodial sentence to deliver both punishment and deterrence.

The defence accepts the gravity of the offences and the need for a firm response but urges the court to consider community-based alternatives, pointing to Mr H’s personal difficulties, absence of prior violent offending, and the potential for rehabilitation if proper support is secured.

Legal submissions referenced the sentencing guideline published by the Sentencing Council in 2022, emphasizing the importance of proportionality, the evaluation of harm and culpability, and the role of both mitigating and aggravating factors.

Additional Observations  
In this period, the court notes an increase in reports relating to street homelessness and undesignated rough sleepers in the Manchester city centre and surrounding districts. Such socio-economic pressures are relevant background factors, although not directly attributable to this case.

Similarly, recent enhancements to the court building itself, including upgraded security systems and improved accessibility features, have marginally facilitated case management for vulnerable defendants, victims, and professionals alike. The refurbishment project, completed in April 2025, involved multiple stakeholders, including local charities and persons with lived experience.

The court also acknowledges receipt of a letter from one of Mr H’s siblings, Ms Annette H., whose own proceedings for benefit fraud are unrelated but nevertheless cast light on a family environment marked by economic hardship and fractured relational dynamics.

It is noteworthy that a co-defendant in an unrelated matter appearing in this court is currently at large following failure to appear; that case involved serious charges including affray and possession of a bladed article. While entirely separate, the matter alludes to the wider challenges local law enforcement faces in ensuring effective custody management and compliance with bail conditions.

Sentencing Options and the Court’s Approach  
The court recognizes the complexity inherent in cases straddling criminal behaviour, personal vulnerability, and systemic shortcomings. The sentencing exercise must delicately balance accountability with opportunity for rehabilitation, community protection with proportionality.

In considering all material, the court will request a full pre-sentence report, including an up-to-date risk assessment and suitability for structured community interventions. Particular attention should be paid to possible engagement with programmes targeting impulsivity and acquisitive offending, alongside consideration of housing stability and substance misuse treatment.

This court is firmly of the view that neither punitive excess nor leniency motivated by sympathy alone can serve the ends of justice. The response must be measured, evidence-based, and attuned both to the needs of the defendant and the wider public interest.

These sentencing remarks have been delivered on the 14th day of September 2025 in Court 4 at the Manchester Crown Court. The hearing has been conducted in open court, transcribed, and recorded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is presently advised of his right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
