IN THE CROWN COURT AT WINDSOR  
R v. MR H  
Case No. 2025/15593  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Eleanor W. Cartwright  
Filed: 12 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction on a representative charge relating to multiple instances of theft from various retail premises within the Windsor and Maidenhead areas over a period extending from July 2023 to February 2025. The offending is prosecuted under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968.

This court is acutely conscious that acquisitive crime, though often considered "low-level," carries cumulative effects that are not merely monetary but extend to the destabilisation of community confidence in public safety and the viability of small retailers. The social fabric that supports local commerce depends upon lawful conduct and mutual respect between businesses and customers alike. Offences such as those before me, while sometimes dismissed as victimless or opportunistic, often impose an emotional and operational toll upon individuals and institutions, stretching police resources and voluntary sectors thin in their efforts to alleviate harm.

Procedural History  
Your prosecution originated in September 2024 following a complex, multi-agency inquiry led by the Thames Valley Police Retail Crime Unit, in conjunction with the Windsor Neighbourhood Policing Team and the Royal Borough Business Crime Forum. The initial triggers were reports from several small independent shops noting repeated and suspicious losses of stock, often involving items of nominal individual value but notable in aggregate. The investigative phase included collation of CCTV over months, covert observations, and deployment of plainclothes officers during peak retail hours to monitor suspicious behaviour.

The business community in Windsor has, over recent years, mobilised expertise and resources through the Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), aiming to enhance information sharing and proactive deterrence strategies. While these efforts have ameliorated certain patterns of organised retail crime, this case underscores the ongoing challenges posed by persistent offenders whose actions, though on a smaller scale, erode the commercial climate and strain statutory services.

The investigation itself was marked by exemplary inter-agency cooperation: the police provided timely intelligence briefs to local authority licensing teams; trading standards officers advised on compliance and notification protocols; and community safety partnerships engaged to offer victim support mechanisms. Notably, representatives from the Windsor Federation of Shopkeepers contributed detailed statements about the behavioural impact of repeat thefts, stressing not only financial loss but also heightened anxiety and staffing challenges.

The court records that you were arrested on 15 February 2025 and subsequently interviewed under caution on 17 February. Initially, you denied involvement and did not provide any substantive account. However, forensic analysis of recovered items and matching of purchases to transactions captured on digital tills formed an evidential narrative consistent with your identification. You were charged on 2 March 2025 with multiple counts subsequently consolidated into a single representative charge to streamline proceedings.

This matter was allocated to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol. The framework of BCM is designed to promote early clarity on evidential matters and to facilitate efficient pre-trial preparation. Although some procedural delay was occasioned by the necessity to obtain certain digital forensic reports, these were largely mitigated by the concerted efforts of all agencies involved to adhere to the timelines prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Rules.

A plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 7 August 2025, where you pleaded not guilty. Additional evidence was served, including witness statements from store managers and experts in retail security. However, following a review of the evidence and further legal advice, you entered a guilty plea on the morning of the trial, on 6 October 2025. Attention must be drawn to the timing of your plea. Late pleas, while entitled to some credit, do not attract the same degree of mitigation as early admissions of guilt and can impose unnecessary burden on victims and judicial resources.

The court is mindful of the jurisprudence governing reductions in sentence for guilty pleas. In R v. Collin [2019] EWCA Crim 1784, the Court of Appeal underscored that the timing, nature, and impact of the plea governing mitigation is a matter of judicial discretion. Delays in pleading guilty, especially when not explained by factors such as mental health or legal complexity, are viewed less favourably. Similarly, the guidance in R v. Bound [2022] EWCA Crim 1341 reiterates that guilty plea discounts are designed to reward early rehabilitation and effective case progression, not tactical manoeuvres after overwhelming evidence emerges.

Attention has been drawn by the Crown to R v. Huntley [2023] EWCA Crim 1170, a case involving aggravated burglary in which the Court of Appeal emphasised the serious impact of an offender’s choice to deny culpability for an extended period. While clearly distinct in gravity from the present matter, Huntley draws a useful general principle in relation to transparency of admissions and the safeguarding of victim interests.

It is also pertinent to note the decision in R v. Carmichael [2021] EWCA Crim 984, where the offender persisted in denying involvement in a series of public order offences until trial, delaying closure for witnesses and community safety services. The Court stressed that late pleas must be measured against the overall interests of justice, public confidence, and resource allocation.

This court, likewise, observes these considerations, emphasising that guilty pleas entered at the cusp of trial, absent compelling explanation, attract only partial credit.

I have received and read with attention the pre-sentence reports submitted by the Thames Valley Probation Service, prepared by Officer Helen Davies. The report is cogent and methodical, presenting an overview of your personal circumstances, offending history, and rehabilitative prospects. It notes your history includes several prior convictions for theft-related offences, some resulting in community orders and others in conditional discharges. Your background demonstrates intermittent engagement with support and social services, though limited compliance hampered sustained progress.

Officer Davies’ assessment highlights your unsettled housing status, currently residing in temporary accommodation provided by local authority emergency housing arrangements. Your employment record is sparse, with the most recent engagement ending in early 2023. The report notes past difficulties with substance misuse, including episodes of excessive alcohol consumption, though no formal diagnosis or treatment has been recorded. There is no documented history of severe mental illness. You have declined, or failed to maintain, contact with several community rehabilitation programmes offered post-release.

The probation service recommends consideration of an intensive Community Order incorporating Rehabilitation and Unpaid Work requirements, alongside possible entry into a Cognitive Behavioural Thinking Skills Programme. A central concern is the risk of reoffending, particularly given the pattern and persistence demonstrated in the offences now before the court.

The local authority social services department has forwarded correspondence reflecting ongoing attempts to secure settled housing for you, albeit hindered by acute pressure on available stock and the broader social housing crisis affecting the region. It is an unfortunate reality that homelessness, or the threat thereof, is a recurrent feature in the backgrounds of many defendants appearing before the Crown Court. Nevertheless, such circumstances do not diminish the responsibility to desist from criminal conduct.

I must place on record the difficulties currently faced by the Legal Aid Agency in processing applications for expert assessments. Your defence solicitors’ request for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist specialising in complex acquisitive offending was met with protracted delay, only resolved following judicial direction in the Administrative Court in July 2025. These systemic challenges impose tangible strain on the timely delivery of justice and hamper the ability of defendants to present fully informed mitigation.

Equally, it is appropriate to acknowledge the indispensable role played by the Windsor Retail Victim Support Network, whose engagement with affected store employees has provided valuable victim impact material. Their volunteer coordinators continue to address the array of challenges inherent in supporting workers subject to frequent petty theft, including anxiety, reduced job satisfaction, and, in some cases, requests for altered work patterns to avoid periods of risk.

The court also notes correspondence from the Windsor Community Substance Misuse Service, which, while confirming no current engagement by you, expressed openness to future referral, conditional on your willingness to participate. Such multi-agency collaboration is emblematic of modern efforts to interrupt the cycle of offending, though its success remains contingent on cooperation by the defendant.

The facts of the case may be stated as follows.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

Your conduct involved a methodical and repeated pattern of entering premises during busy hours, exploiting staff distraction and employing techniques such as concealment within clothing and bags, as well as occasionally using pretexts to engage employees in conversation. The totality of the losses, whilst individually modest, represented a significant impact for the businesses in question.

The crown notes the absence of violent or threatening behaviour, though stresses that the cumulative effect of your offending has produced measurable harm to employee wellbeing and store viability.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Further younger employees reported a lingering sense of unease and expressed apprehension about future contact with you, particularly given the repeated incidents occurring within their shifts.

Despite multiple previous diversionary interventions — including cautions and community resolutions — you resumed this behaviour, suggesting a worrying pattern of recidivism.

In assessing culpability and appropriate sanction, it is useful to recall principles articulated in the Sentencing Council guidelines for theft offences, which emphasise the seriousness of deliberate, sustained dishonesty and the impact on victims' confidence. The guidelines direct sentencing judges to distinguish between incidental opportunistic acts and calculated courses of conduct, the latter warranting higher levels of punishment.

In the present case, the court must calibrate the seriousness of your offending against both mitigating personal circumstances and the aggravating features of persistence, premeditation, and impact. No evidence of gang association or co-offending arises, and there is no indication of exploitation of vulnerability.

The court is mindful of the wider societal context in which such offending occurs. The present era has seen an increase in informal urban street economies and related acquisitive behaviours, often underpinned by precarious housing and economic instability. Local authorities report overwhelming demand for social services, compounded by national shortages in affordable housing and rising living costs.

This macro environment, whilst exogenous to your case, is rightly borne in mind as part of holistic sentencing. That said, individual accountability remains paramount. The common good depends upon adherence to the rule of law and respect for the property and labour of others. The courts cannot sanction criminality premised on hardship or social exclusion.

This case proceeded with the benefit of a comprehensive psychiatric liaison report prepared by Dr Jonathan Mehta, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, who conducted an independent assessment in early September 2025. Dr Mehta's report concludes there is no major psychiatric disorder affecting your criminal responsibility. Some temperamental impulsivity and low mood were noted, but these were deemed insufficient to excuse or substantially mitigate your actions. The court notes the psychiatric observations regarding limited insight and ambivalence towards engagement with existing support frameworks.

Moreover, the report highlights that while conditions such as intermittent alcohol misuse were apparent, there was no diagnosis of dependency syndrome. The presence of such factors, though not determinative, may inform rehabilitative approaches but do not, in themselves, alter culpability.

The court further considers the case law cited by both counsel. Of particular weight is the ruling in R v. Goodwin [2020] EWCA Crim 327, where repeated shoplifting offences motivated by economic need were held to justify a community order incorporating intensive supervision, provided that engagement with structured support was credible. By contrast, in R v. Thatcher [2018] EWCA Crim 849, a pattern of escalating acquisitive crime with deliberate evasion of support networks warranted immediate custody.

The defendant’s previous offending history is also germane. While earlier disposal by community resolution schemes reflect an attempt at diversionary and rehabilitative strategies, their failure to prevent reoffending signals the need for more robust intervention.

In terms of the practical impact of your offences, the court has carefully weighed victim impact statements and evidence from local trading standards and police community officers. It has emerged that several stores altered staffing patterns, reduced opening hours, or installed additional security measures, incurring costs borne ultimately by consumers and operators.

The court is not oblivious to the increasing administrative burdens on police and community protection services brought on by persistent shoplifting and other low-level acquisitive crimes. Thames Valley Police have reported a growing caseload pressure, diverting attention from more serious offending. It is important to convey that such offences, when recurrent, degrade the capacity of front-line services and community safety initiatives.

I acknowledge and thank counsel for their submissions. Ms Angela Murphy, leading for the Crown, has presented a clear outline of the gravity and public interest in deterrence. Mr Oliver Benson, representing the defence, has frankly conceded the factual matrix and emphasised your personal difficulties, pleading for a community-based resolution that balances accountability with the opportunities for rehabilitation.

The court regrets that funding delays resulted in the late provision of expert psychiatric evidence, underscoring the broader systemic issues affecting the efficient administration of justice. It is incumbent upon the Legal Aid Agency to review procedural processes to prevent such costly hindrance.

It is instructive to observe that this court has hosted multiple cases illustrative of the complex nexus between acquisitive offending and social marginalisation. For instance, in R v. Ayodele [2022] EWCA Crim 1140, the defendant’s pattern of shoplifting was linked to untreated mental health conditions and homelessness, prompting a non-custodial sentence coupled with targeted support interventions. By contrast, in R v. Lewis [2021] EWCA Crim 712, persistent theft involving criminal exploitation resulted in an immediate custodial term.

Neither of these cases maps neatly onto your circumstances, but their principles and outcomes demonstrate the balancing exercise inherent in sentencing.

It remains the inescapable fact that repeated breaches of trust in the commercial realm corrode mutual confidence and engender a climate of suspicion and hardship. Small business owners, often operating on thin margins, cannot absorb frequent losses without consequence to their viability and to the local economy.

From a historic perspective, the Theft Act 1968 — enacted to consolidate earlier provisions — sought to provide a clear legal framework for the protection of property rights in a rapidly changing social and economic landscape. Over the ensuing decades, legislative amendments and judicial interpretation have adapted this framework to evolving societal norms and challenges.

The move towards joint working through partnership frameworks such as Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARAC) and Integrated Offender Management (IOM) reflects an ongoing commitment to holistic, preventative strategies.

Nevertheless, limitations in capacity remain. Local Probation Services report increased caseloads and reduced specialist team availability for assessments, particularly of acquisitive offenders with complex psychosocial needs. These resource constraints inevitably influence the granularity and timeliness of rehabilitative recommendations.

I must also acknowledge, with mixture of regret and understanding, that the pressures on court list management — compounded by the recent industrial action by court clerical staff nationally — have led to unavoidable adjournments in some cases. The listing office at Windsor Crown Court has during this period experienced shortfalls that necessitate flexible arrangements. While these are operational considerations, the court notes their intensification of procedural delay.

Turning to the issue of restorative justice, correspondence from Local Justice Partners highlights that opportunities for victim-defendant mediation in shoplifting cases remain limited, due in part to victims’ understandable reticence and the often transient nature of offenders’ social circumstances. While such programs have shown promise in other contexts, their application here is, at present, constrained.

Community-based services, including the Windsor Outreach and Reconnection Initiative — a voluntary sector programme offering mentoring and crisis support — have indicated willingness to engage post-sentence, conditional on judicial referral. The court encourages the active exploitation of such services where viable.

In closing, I remind you that the sentencing court seeks to strike an appropriate balance between punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. Your particular case demands a response calibrated to the seriousness of your offending, tempered by your personal circumstances and prospects for change.

As of this date, I reserve full sentencing until the receipt of the final, comprehensive pre-sentence report following updated probation assessments. The report should explicitly consider the suitability of community order requirements, cognitive skills interventions, and any ancillary health or social care provisions that might advance your rehabilitation while securing effective public safeguarding.

These sentencing remarks are issued on the 12th day of October 2025 in Court 5 at Windsor Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, which must be exercised within 28 days of sentence. No special reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged. Costs are reserved for further consideration.

These are the orders of the court.
