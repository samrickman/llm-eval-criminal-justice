IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL SOUTH  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/15743  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. E. Hale  
Filed: 14 September 2025

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentencing following your conviction on a count of theft from retail premises, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans various incidents in the Bristol city centre and outlying neighbourhoods over the period of approximately 18 months. This list notably commences in the spring of 2024 and continues into early 2025.

Procedural History  
The Crown Prosecution Service laid charges against you after an investigation conducted primarily by the Bristol City Centre Neighbourhood Policing Team in conjunction with the Avon Somerset Business Crime Reduction Partnership. The latter, an initiative established in 2016, aims to facilitate information sharing and operational cooperation between local retailers, police forces, and community stakeholders, seeking to curtail the rise of acquisitive crime in the urban commercial zone. According to reports received, the incidence of such offences necessitating intervention has progressively increased year-on-year, despite innovative measures targeting offenders and repeat locations.

It should be recorded at the outset that this case arose amidst the complex challenges afflicting contemporary policing and local government services. Reduced funding, increased demand, and workforce shortages have conspired to limit preventative capacity, resulting in enhanced dependence on reactive enforcement and investigatory work. The network of retail outlets implicated here includes both large chain stores and smaller independent pharmacies, each of which has suffered financial damage and operational disruption due to persistent shoplifting activity.

Your arrest took place on 11 April 2025, following coordinated activity involving local police officers and retail security personnel. A number of CCTV captures and witness statements formed the basis for your identification. There is no suggestion of violence or use of force in relation to your actions, though victims and employees have testified to distress caused by repeated targeting. You were initially interviewed under caution on 13 April 2025, during which you declined to make any comment. Forensic analysis of seized items — which included clothing and a small backpack — yielded fibres and trace materials consistent with those observed in various security videos.

A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 2 June 2025. At this hearing, you entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was listed for 12 August 2025 but was ultimately vacated after your defence team applied for, and was granted, an adjournment to permit expert psychiatric evidence to be obtained. Subsequent hearings proceeded, and it was only on 3 September 2025, shortly before the commencement of trial, that you changed your plea to guilty.

The court is constrained to remark upon the regrettably familiar phenomenon of last-minute plea shifts in cases of this nature. It has become commonplace for defendants to maintain innocence until the evidence becomes insurmountable, thereby placing avoidable pressure upon courts, victims, and prosecuting authorities alike. We grapple daily with the adverse impacts of such delays upon judicial efficiency, the well-being of those affected by the offence, and the proper utilisation of finite resources.

This behaviour is not to be rewarded generously by way of credit. The principle of credit for early guilty pleas, established in R v. McEwan [2019] EWCA Crim 517, emphasises that only when a plea is entered at the first reasonable opportunity should the full reduction apply. The later the plea, the less credit is due, reflecting the diminished value of the concession.

Notwithstanding this, the court notes that your guilty plea does represent some acceptance of responsibility for the conduct in question. Any expressed remorse will be considered alongside other factors pertinent to sentencing. However, the timing of your plea tempers the weight to which that admission is entitled.

The matter was listed before this court at Bristol Crown Court, which, it may be noted, was officially opened in 1998 by Her Majesty. The court is a key venue within the circuit, presiding over serious crime and hosting specialist magistrates’ appeal sittings. The courtroom itself underwent refurbishment in 2023, improving accessibility and technological capacity.

The probation service’s pre-sentence report, prepared by Officer Caroline Benton, details your background and relevant offending history. Your record includes three prior convictions for theft-related offences, predominantly shoplifting, with one matter resolved by conditional discharge in 2021. You have not, historically, been known to pose a direct risk of violence to others. The report notes current unemployment and unstable housing as factors in your social circumstances.

In her report, Officer Benton highlights your apparent disengagement from support services offered within the community, including financial literacy courses and local substance misuse programmes. This is compounded by a noted history of episodic alcohol misuse and periods of social isolation. Her professional assessment underscores the need for focused intervention targeting impulsivity, problem-solving skills, and social connectedness.

A psychological assessment was carried out by Dr Edmund Voss, consultant forensic psychologist, whose report was submitted to this court and made available to both parties. Dr Voss describes you as presenting with mild to moderate difficulties in executive functioning, which may impair decision-making and self-regulation in stressful contexts. He does not diagnose a formal mental illness, but notes traits consistent with borderline personality organisation, specifically relating to emotional volatility and interpersonal insecurity.

Dr Voss recommends engagement with a structured cognitive behavioural therapy programme tailored to address offending behaviour, highlighting that such treatment could reduce recidivism rates and enhance long-term public safety. However, he also cautions that your previous history of non-compliance with community orders and sporadic engagement with voluntary services may limit effectiveness without sustained support.

The impact upon victims and retail staff cannot be overstated. Submissions received from the Bristol Independent Retailers’ Association detail financial losses accrued, the frustration of employees subjected to repeated victimisation, and the resultant anxiety leading to staff absences and de-staffing during certain shifts to reduce exposure. One victim describes adapting workplace routines, including the installation of additional security tagging and CCTV cameras, which represent further economic investment.

Moreover, the representations praise your letter to the court, which expressed what was described by your defence counsel as “thoughtful reflection” on the wider consequences of your conduct. It is regrettable that such insight came several months into proceedings.

The sentencing guidelines applicable in this jurisdiction are those promulgated by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guidelines for theft offences, last revised in April 2024. These guidelines recommend consideration of factors including the value of property taken, degree of planning or sophistication involved, impact on victims, and presence of aggravating or mitigating considerations.

In particular, aggravating features include previous convictions for similar offences, targeting vulnerable businesses, and failure to desist despite prior intervention. Mitigating factors may include early guilty plea, genuine remorse, and engagement or willingness to engage with rehabilitative programmes.

The principles of sentencing articulated in R v. Lister [2022] EWCA Crim 1789 remain authoritative here: punishment must reflect culpability, with due regard to the need to deter both the individual and wider community, protect the public, and promote rehabilitation where practical.

Turning briefly to less immediately relevant judicial material, the court recalls recent appellate decisions concerning unrelated matters that, whilst in the realm of criminal law, bear only tangential significance here. For instance, in R v. Featherstone [2023] EWCA Crim 463, a case involving arson endangering life, the sentencing principles reinforced the primacy of public safety yet do not materially affect theft-related sentencing. Similarly, R v. Choong [2024] EWCA Crim 528 considered aspects of disclosure obligations in complex fraud trials, a matter presently of no import.

Such references serve as reminders of the broad and varied landscape of criminal jurisprudence within which this case is situated, though the court remains judicious in applying precedent apt to the facts before it.

The criminal justice system currently faces significant systemic challenges. The Legal Aid Agency continues to suffer from chronic underfunding and administrative inefficiencies, contributing to delays in the instruction of experts and briefings in cases such as this. These issues reflect broader societal underinvestment and jeopardise timely access to justice—matters that have also been highlighted by the Justice Select Committee in recent reports.

Similarly, the National Probation Service remains overstretched, impacted by high caseloads and recruitment difficulties. The capacity to deliver comprehensive rehabilitative services is consequently diminished. These structural realities underscore the importance of courts issuing carefully reasoned orders to optimise the use of available resources.

Prison services are likewise under strain, with occupancy rates persistently exceeding target thresholds. The deployment of short custodial sentences in cases of this nature—which often entail sentences of less than 12 months—carries critical implications, particularly in terms of access to rehabilitative programming and post-release supervision. Alternatives to custody, where appropriate, may better serve public safety and facilitate the reduction of reoffending.

In discharging its responsibilities today, this court has carefully balanced these competing considerations.

The court has also received extensive correspondence and reports that, while of significant interest, bear upon wider systemic issues more than your personal circumstances. For example, letters from local homelessness charities detail the increasing prevalence of street sleeping in Bristol and the myriad challenges faced by vulnerable populations. While undeniably important, these matters, though related to your housing insecurity, do not mitigate the gravity of the offence.

Further input from the Bristol Retail Trust highlights the cumulative effect of shop theft on community trust, business viability, and the erosion of
