IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTFORD  
R v. MR H  
Case No. HCT/2025/05637  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. R. Bramwell  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence in relation to charges arising from a course of conduct involving shoplifting offences under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending took place over a number of months across multiple retail establishments within the Newark and Hartfield commercial areas. The Crown accepts, and it is so recorded, that this is a representative charge intended to encapsulate your repeated conduct.

Procedural History  
Your case was initially lodged with the Magistrates’ Court in early April 2025 and subsequently proceeded by way of committal to the Crown Court by remittal pursuant to s.51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, having been deemed triable either way due to the persistent nature of the offending and the involvement of multiple premises. The transfer to this jurisdiction was effected on 15 July 2025. Much of the procedural progress has been in line with the expectations set out under the Better Case Management regime — a framework designed to streamline the pre-trial process, reduce delay, and improve the overall administration of justice.

The BCM initiative carries with it substantial expectations of co-operation among the relevant agencies involved, including police, prosecution counsel, defence representatives, and court administrators. While the underlying scheme remains laudable in principle, the court must acknowledge that compliance is inconsistent. There have been regrettable examples, across the country, of delays caused by incomplete disclosure, late expert reports, and intermittent availability of defence counsel — all underscored by ongoing pressures on court resources exacerbated by national strike actions and periodic IT disruptions. It is a testament to the efforts of the individuals here that, notwithstanding such challenges, this case has thus far been conducted more expeditiously than many.

The initial hearing took place on 21 April 2025 in Magistrates’ Court at Newgate, at which you were granted conditional bail to reside at a nominated address with restrictions on your movement and requirements to appear at each hearing. You have complied with these bail terms without reported incidence. The preliminary plea and trial preparation hearing was scheduled for 25 June 2025 but adjourned to 30 June 2025 to accommodate an application made by the defence to instruct a forensic psychologist with expertise in acquisitive offending, specifically in relation to patterns of impulsivity and recidivism. This application, as the court records with some frustration, experienced multiple delays in approval owing to protracted correspondence between your solicitors and the Legal Aid Agency.

It is a matter which this court cannot emphasise enough: the timely sanctioning of expert assessments is critical, particularly in cases where clinical input has the potential to materially influence sentencing alternatives and risk management strategies. The bureaucratic inertia displayed by the Legal Aid administration in routine matters such as this is, at best, disheartening—and at worst, detrimental to the delivery of justice.

The forensic psychological evaluation was completed by Dr Helen Truscott, Consultant Clinical Forensic Psychologist, whose report was lodged 15 August 2025. Her detailed and professionally written assessment included a review of your early history, prior criminal records, and an exploration of underlying motivational factors for the offending behaviour. Dr Truscott was also clear in noting that no formal diagnosis of mental illness was applicable in your case, but she highlighted features consistent with emotional dysregulation, poor impulse control, and elements of socio-economic marginalisation.

A plea and trial preparation hearing was conducted on 30 June 2025 at this court. At that time, and for reasons articulated by your legal team, you entered a not guilty plea. The Crown fully complied with disclosure obligations, supplying voluminous evidence including closed-circuit television footage, witness statements, and forensic findings connecting you to multiple incidents. The case was set down for a contested trial beginning on 15 September 2025.

On the day fixed for trial, however, your counsel applied to alter your plea to guilty on all counts. The application was unopposed by the Crown and accepted by the court. Such late pleas, though permissible, attract reduced credit for mitigation of sentence as set out in well-established authority.

It is important to remind ourselves that the use of plea credit is governed not by mechanical formulae, but by substantive considerations of timing, acceptance of responsibility, and overall impact on the administration of justice. The Court of Appeal’s judgment in R v. O’Donnell [2023] EWCA Crim 1751 made clear that a plea entered just prior to trial, rather than at the earliest opportunity, warrants a commensurately lower discount.

Turning to the position of victims and ancillary parties, the court has received and carefully reviewed several victim statements. The statements, obtained through liaison with the Hartford Business Crime Reduction Partnership, articulate profound concerns about employee safety, economic loss, and the ongoing distress caused by repeated thefts. There is clear evidence that store employees endured heightened anxiety and operational disruption as a consequence of the offending, with some staff members requesting alterations to their shifts as a precautionary measure. These are not minor considerations; they reveal the real-world implications of your behaviour extending well beyond the immediate financial cost.

The court has also considered correspondence from the Hartfield Community Support Network—a voluntary organisation that assists vulnerable persons in crisis, including those experiencing homelessness and substance dependency. While unrelated directly to your case, their communications highlight the severe operational pressures under which local agencies function, serving populations marked by intersecting vulnerabilities. This agency notes a marked increase in shoplifting incidents in the region, manifesting as one facet of a broader pattern combining economic deprivation and social exclusion.

It is fitting to acknowledge the diligence of the probation officers responsible for supporting individuals engaged with the justice system in this locality. However, the court notes with regret the recurrent shortage of staff within the National Probation Service, a nationwide issue that has resulted in delayed assessments, restricted supervision, and truncated rehabilitative offerings. Such constraints necessarily factor into our consideration of appropriate sentencing options, particularly the feasibility of community-based disposals.

Past inquiries into the efficacy of multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) and multi-agency risk assessment conferences (MARAC) underscore the challenges of coordinating input from criminal justice agencies, social services, health providers, and voluntary organisations. While these frameworks function well where sufficient resource and leadership exist, gaps persist, threatening public safety and offender rehabilitation alike. Recent academic literature suggests that acquisitive offenders with a history of impulsivity and economic need may benefit from holistic interventions combining mental health treatment, vocational training, and structured community supervision—options this court will bear in mind.

Absence of serious violence in the conduct in question is noted. However, the court is mindful that the absence of physical harm does not equate to triviality. The offence of theft involves a fundamental breach of the property rights that underpin social trust and commercial viability. Persistent theft can corrode the confidence of small business operators and erode labour relations through indirect consequences such as increased workload, stress, and turnover.

The principles to be applied in sentencing theft are well-established. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the foundational legislative provision defining the offence and its components: dishonesty, appropriation, property belonging to another, and the intention to permanently deprive. Relevant sentencing guidance can be found in the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on Theft Offences (2021), which elaborates on culpability bands, harm categories, and the availability of alternative sentencing mechanisms such as community orders incorporating rehabilitation activities.

Case law pertinent to the crediting of guilty pleas includes the well-known ruling of R v. Ballard [2019] EWCA Crim 2734, emphasizing that significant reductions are seldom appropriate where pleas are entered at a late stage, particularly when trials are imminent and victims have undergone the stress of preparing for evidence. Further, R v. Holland [2020] EWCA Crim 475 reminds courts to calibrate mitigation according to both the timeliness of acceptance and the sincerity of remorse.

The facts of this case require more thorough engagement. The offences were not isolated nor accidental; they constitute a pattern reflecting deliberation and personalised modus operandi. Surveillance footage indicates consistent use of tactics such as concealment within clothing layers, uncooperative behaviour when challenged by staff, and repetition of visits to introduce a cumulative effect.

The impact on victims’ staff morale and business operations is documented as particularly acute in at least two independent pharmacies and a convenience store regarded as a community hub. These premises suffered not only financial loss but reputational harm, as customers expressed unease at the frequency of theft attempts.

Despite referral to diversion programmes following a previous caution in late 2023, there was a regrettable resumption of offending behaviour within a few weeks. Such relapse underscores the challenge in effecting sustained behavioural change absent intensive and well-resourced intervention.

The court has reviewed the pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Ms Imogen Reid, dated 5 September 2025, which highlights various factors bearing upon risk and rehabilitation. Ms Reid underscores your history of unstable accommodation, intermittent employment, and disengagement with support networks. The report characterises your risk of reoffending as medium and recommends, subject to court approval, enrollment in a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) group focused on acquisitive crime, alongside a Resettlement Pathway designed to address housing instability.

It is salutary to reflect on the burden that shoplifting places upon front-line police resources. Const
