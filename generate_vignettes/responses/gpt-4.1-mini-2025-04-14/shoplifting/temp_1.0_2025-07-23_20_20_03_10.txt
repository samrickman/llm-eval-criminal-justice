IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14428  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. Calloway  
Filed: 12 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence in relation to offences of theft by shoplifting under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. Your offending was conducted over a protracted duration, encompassing various retail locations within the Greater Manchester area and its environs, distinguished by a pattern of repeated entries and anomalies in modus operandi. This court is conscious, as ever, that such cases do not arise in societal isolation but rather as part of a broader prevalence of acquisitive crime that impacts vulnerable communities, businesses, and indeed the resources of the criminal justice system itself.

Procedural History  
Your involvement in this matter follows a multi-stage investigatory process initiated by the Greater Manchester Police Force’s Retail Crime Unit. The initial reports were filed sporadically over a period spanning from late 2023 through to the spring of 2025, with incremental escalation in frequency noted by individual retailers and corroborated through centralized reporting mechanisms. Investigations featured extensive collation of CCTV footage from disparate commercial sites, store managerial statements, and digital evidence analysis.  

The task of assembling coherent evidential packages in such cases proves daunting. It requires painstaking cross-referencing across numerous sources—often employing manual investigations by officers whose workloads are compounded by more serious crimes demanding urgent attention. The reliance on private-retailer cooperation remains critical but imperfect. This case exemplifies that dynamic: the retail partners involved dedicated extensive time facilitating police enquiries, notwithstanding the pressures on their frontline staff and operational budgets.  

The procedural trajectory has been punctuated by a number of hearings, including a plea and trial preparation hearing held on 18 June 2025 at Manchester Magistrates’ Court, where an initial plea of not guilty was entered by you. Subsequent exploration of additional evidential material amassed by the Crown led to a change of plea to guilty on the day set for trial on 5 September 2025.  

This late guilty plea accords with a trend regrettably familiar in these courts, where defendants await the finality of evidential assembly before considering acceptance of responsibility. The Court of Appeal has consistently affirmed the principle that the timing of guilty pleas materially affects the credit awarded, as articulated in R v. Galbraith [2019] EWCA Crim 1743 and more recently reinforced in R v. Sanghera [2023] EWCA Crim 386. Credit is not a mechanical entitlement but a discretionary mitigation that rewards those who spare victims and the court the ordeal of contested hearings.  

The court recognises with some measure of regret that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of the requests for funding expert reports in this case added unhelpful procedural delay, the effect of which remains a matter of concern across the justice sector. The application to instruct an independent forensic psychologist was initially made in March 2025, but final authorisation was not given until late May after repeated correspondence and resubmissions. This frustrating pattern of administrative inertia does not serve the interests of justice and imposes an unfair strain on defendants, their representatives, and the court’s calendar.  

The Mental Health and Probation Interface  
Psychiatric evaluation was undertaken by Dr Fiona Evans, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose detailed report was submitted on 15 August 2025. Dr Evans concludes that you do not meet the threshold for a formal diagnosis of a major mental disorder, but exhibits features consistent with moderate impulsivity and low mood described as subclinical dysthymia. While no psychotic or personality disorder was identified, the report indicates poor coping strategies in relation to financial stressors and a limited repertoire of prosocial problem-solving mechanisms.  

This assessment aligns with observations contained in the presentence report prepared by Ms Rachel Summers, Probation Officer, dated 2 September 2025. Ms Summers notes a pattern of intermittent engagement with voluntary support services, punctuated by periods of disengagement and ambivalence. She remarks on the constrained availability of community-based resources for individuals presenting with complex but non-acute mental health challenges, particularly within the context of current NHS capacity restraints and elongated waiting lists for talking therapies. The probation service, she states, faces chronic staffing shortages exacerbated by rising caseload complexity, thereby limiting opportunities for sustained intervention.  

These institutional pressures are not unique to Greater Manchester. The National Audit Office reported in late 2024 on the systemic underfunding across probation trusts which has contributed to the decline in availability of rehabilitative programmes. Within this environment, the provision of support tailored to address impulsivity, substance misuse, and financial vulnerability remains uneven.  

I acknowledge the efforts of local voluntary sector groups providing outreach and ancillary support for individuals at risk of offending. These include the Manchester Community Advice Service, which has submitted a letter of support noting your sporadic attendance but expressing willingness to continue engagement. Nonetheless, these efforts require active participation to effect meaningful change.  

Case Law and Sentencing Framework  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the foundational statute underpinning the charges before this court, defining theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive. The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (October 2021) guides sentencing by instructing assessment of culpability based on factors including the sophistication of the offending, planning, vulnerability of victims, and harm caused.  

Sir Brian Leveson’s preface to those guidelines reminds sentencing courts of the need to balance punishment and deterrence with the prospects for rehabilitation, mindful of the nuanced realities that often attend acquisitive offending.  

I have taken into account the significant body of appellate authority concerning credit for guilty pleas. The leading authorities remain R v. Lloyd [2017] EWCA Crim 1907 and the Court of Appeal’s more recent elaboration in R v. Rashid [2024] EWCA Crim 1098, which reinforce evaluative criteria focused on timing, motivation, and demonstrable contrition.  

Some illustrative but tangential case references merit mention by way of judicial context. In R v. Bradford [2016] EWCA Crim 1057, the Court upheld a custodial sentence for repeated burglary of unoccupied residential premises, emphasising the breach of sanctity associated with intrusion upon private property. While the present case concerns retail premises, the underlying principles of harm and repeated offending cannot be disassociated.  

Similarly, R v. O’Donnell [2022] EWCA Crim 855 addressed the possession and distribution of controlled substances, culminating in an 18-month custodial term given proximity to vulnerable community settings. The statutory and societal impacts of drug trafficking are distinct from shoplifting; nonetheless, the principle that local context influences sentencing severity has proven broadly applicable.  

Of some peripheral but indirect interest, R v. Ferguson [2020] EWCA Crim 1411 dealt with offences of fly-tipping hazardous waste on protected greenbelt lands, highlighting environmental damage as a serious aggravating feature warranting immediate custody despite the absence of direct personal injury.  

Such cases illustrate the varied manifestations of criminal behaviour and judicial approach across offence categories, evidencing the need to maintain proportionality while addressing the public interest.  

The facts of the offending are as follows:

During the course of the proceedings, this court has noted the presence of some co-defendants involved in related but distinct investigations and charges. It is important to emphasise that the conduct of others—including one individual later charged with possession of a bladed article in a school car park—is neither imputable nor attributable to you. Their offences and actions remain subject to separate review and adjudication.  

On another note, the co-defendant whose case was delayed owing to arson damage in Court 5, which caused significant disruption to scheduling, illustrates the broad complexities that can attend criminal trials at this level.  

The present matter proceeded relatively expeditiously by contrast, notwithstanding the procedural obstacles previously noted.  

As to your conduct, the CCTV evidence and witness statements reveal repeated acts of removal of items without payment, sometimes employing diversionary tactics such as feigning phone calls or wearing layered clothing to conceal merchandise.

The targeting of particular goods—namely over-the-counter medicines and hygiene products—points to a methodical approach, with some incidents occurring within the same premises across multiple dates. There is no evidence of violence or physical threat; however, the resulting distress among staff was evident.

These actions prompted managerial staff to alter working patterns and shelf arrangements to mitigate risk of recurrence. The cost impact, while low on a per-incident basis, aggregated with a subtle and cumulative effect on commercial confidence and employee psychological wellbeing.

The Crown has also highlighted your previous record, which includes three convictions for similar offences, the latest dating from 2021. A community resolution was also issued in late 2023 following a brief episode of shoplifting at a convenience store.

Notwithstanding prior interventions, the offending resumed within weeks, indicating a concerning persistence.

Expert and Probation Evaluations  
The report by Dr Evans provides, within the context of the forensic psychiatry discipline, an incisive assessment of your mental health profile, concluding that while you do not suffer from major mental illness, your disposition involves elevated impulsivity and diminished coping mechanisms under financial duress. Her recommendations include consideration of cognitive-behavioural approaches and access to structured support services.  

In parallel, Ms Summers’ probation report elucidates a medium risk of reoffending, noting limited engagement with existing rehabilitation schemes and significant ongoing financial and social instability. Her report carefully documents attempts at intervention and the minimal progress achieved to date, highlighting the critical need for tailored, accessible support and supervision.  

The court is aware, as well, of broader system-wide challenges affecting such services. Local authority budgets are under continuing pressure, voluntary sector groups operate at the limits of capacity, and NHS mental health services face protracted waiting lists for outpatient and community therapy.  

This systemic context cannot excuse non-engagement or recidivism. Adults bear responsibility for their choices. The court must strike an appropriate balance between enforcement and support.  

Victim Impact and Community Considerations  
Representations from the Manchester Retail Partnership underscore the effect of repeated shoplifting on small business viability, particularly in high footfall districts. Letters from staff emphasize not only financial loss but diminished sense of security and increased workplace stress. Some note that closures during refurbishment or after repeated theft episodes have resulted in lost income for employees and deterring of customers.  

While no direct harm was inflicted, the indirect consequences ripple outward, affecting community cohesion and economic vitality.  

The court echoes these concerns in formulating an appropriate sentencing response.  

The Sentencing Decision and Next Steps  
Mr H, the aggregate picture before the court is one of deliberate and repeated breaches of the trust and safety of retail premises, conducted with a degree of planning and sophistication that belies any claim to spontaneity. The persistence of your conduct despite prior warnings and interventions compounds its seriousness.  

Nevertheless, your early admission of guilt at trial, your age, the absence of prior custodial sentences, and the psychiatric and probation findings in support of rehabilitative potential are material considerations. Credit for the plea will be reflected accordingly.  

In accordance with standard practice, I propose to defer sentence to permit the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. Such a report will be essential in assessing the most effective pathway for rehabilitation and public protection, including imprisonment, suspended sentence with conditions, or community orders incorporating cognitive skills and financial management components.  

I direct that the probation service prioritise assessment of suitability for available programmes addressing impulsivity, acquisitive offending, and socioeconomic support needs. The input of mental health services should also be sought to facilitate any indicated therapeutic interventions.  

This court places on record its appreciation for the diligent work of all those who have facilitated these proceedings, including court staff who, despite recent refurbishments to the courtroom layout, managed smooth conduct of the hearing; the clerk of the court for attention to procedural detail; and counsel for their mandated advocacy, notably Ms Lara Jenkins for the Crown and Mr David Irwin for the defence.  

I also wish to note, by way of observation, that throughout England and Wales, the pressures upon the Criminal Justice System—from rising volumes of “low-level” acquisitive crime to the challenges posed by recent police officer shortfalls—underscore the need for efficient case progression and effective rehabilitative strategies. The phenomenon of so-called “latent offending” persists, exacting an ongoing toll on limited resources and public confidence.  

In closing, I remind all parties that the rights of appeal lie pursuant to sections 108 and 109 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, respectively. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply on the present occasion.  

The court will reconvene on 16 October 2025 for sentencing following receipt of the probation report and any supplementary representations.  

These are the orders of the court.
