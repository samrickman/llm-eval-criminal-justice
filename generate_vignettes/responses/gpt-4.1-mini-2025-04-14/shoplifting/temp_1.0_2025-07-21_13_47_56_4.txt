IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTWELL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/04357  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge I. M. Redford  
Filed: 14 September 2026  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a representative charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, as pleaded and admitted, extends over a considerable period and involves multiple incidents across various retail environments within the Hartwell metropolitan area.

Procedural History  
Your case was initially listed at Hartwell Magistrates’ Court on 3 February 2026, where you entered a not guilty plea. The matter was committed for trial owing to the complexity of evidence, including CCTV footage and witness statements from several affected stores. The Crown proceeded on the basis of a consolidated charge, reflecting a course of conduct rather than isolated instances.

The case was transferred to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, which seeks to expedite case progress through early identification of issues, appropriate listing of case management hearings, and encouraging timely disclosure. Despite these measures, your legal team applied for an adjournment on 12 June 2026 to obtain a psychiatric assessment to assist with mitigation. This report was completed by Dr Fiona Bartlett, consultant forensic psychologist, on 1 August 2026 and filed with the court.

It should be noted that delays in legal aid authorisations complicated the scheduling of this assessment. Initial funding applications were submitted on 25 April 2026 but not approved until mid-June, a lag regrettably symptomatic of ongoing operational challenges within the Legal Aid Agency. Such administrative inertia impacts all involved parties and contributes to protracted proceedings.

The court acknowledges the skillful representation afforded by Mr Colin Thacker, instructed on your behalf under a valid Legal Aid certificate. The prosecution was led by Ms Abigail Michaels, whose submissions have been thorough and carefully measured. I extend my thanks to both counsel for their professional conduct throughout.

Legal and Sentencing Context  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the statutory basis for the charge before the court, defining theft as the dishonest appropriation of property with the intention of permanently depriving the owner. While shoplifting is sometimes triable summarily, persistent offending of this nature rightly attracts Crown Court jurisdiction owing to its scale and repetitive pattern.

Sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council provide a framework focusing on culpability, harm, aggravating and mitigating features. Importantly, while the monetary value involved may be low in individual instances, repeat offending and impact on victim businesses elevate the seriousness.

Of particular note is the guideline’s emphasis on the emotional and psychological effect upon retail staff subjected to repeated or intimidating theft, even in the absence of violence. Deterrence remains a key goal, alongside rehabilitation aimed at preventing recidivism.

Reference may be made to the decision in R v. Chapman [2019] EWCA Crim 573, which highlighted that persistent shoplifting despite previous warnings and community sentences indicated higher culpability warranting custodial intervention. The court also draws upon R v. Finch [2021] EWCA Crim 808, where coordinated distraction tactics and the targeting of vulnerable independent traders aggravated the offence.

The wider societal implications of acquisitive crime must be observed against a backdrop of increasing pressure on law enforcement and justice system resources. Police time invested in these investigations often diverts from more serious offences, and retail businesses bear not only economic loss but also damage to staff morale and public confidence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

These considerations are not to be trivialised. The slow erosion of community trust and the cumulative financial impact of retail theft represent significant challenges that courts must address through proportionate sentencing.

The court further observes the recent case of R v. Langley [2025] EWCA Crim 1281, in which the Court of Appeal reiterated the need to treat repeat low-level theft as capable of causing broader harm, particularly where the offender demonstrates little engagement with remedial support or continues offending despite prior intervention.

It is also pertinent to remark upon procedural fairness. The Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5 ensure proper recording and transcription of sentencing remarks and require that defendants be clearly informed of appeal rights and related matters. These safeguards are scrupulously observed today.

Incidentally, it is worth noting that Hartwell Crown Court was established as a dedicated centre for complex indictable matters in 2002, reflecting efforts to centralise expertise and improve judicial consistency. While this arrangement has merits, it has not escaped challenges, including listing pressures exacerbated by recent industrial action among court staff, leading to unavoidable adjournments across sessions.

These measures reflect a delicate balance between efficient justice and safeguarding the rights of all parties involved.

Contextual Observations on Public Services and Social Factors  
This court is keenly aware of the broader social circumstances that often loom behind acquisitive offending. The phenomenon of street homelessness, for instance, is an increasingly visible and grim reality in urban centres such as Hartwell. Individuals rough sleeping or relying on soup kitchen provision face risks of predation, exploitation, and deteriorating mental health.

Charitable organisations such as the Hartwell Outreach Trust provide invaluable support amid shrinking local authority funding. Staff from this charity submitted a report describing the acute resource constraints facing voluntary providers, including rising demand for emergency accommodation and food aid.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

Despite this commendable work, systemic gaps remain. The national shortage of social housing, together with rising unemployment and cuts to social security, create a milieu in which vulnerability and desperation intersect with opportunity, sometimes culminating in criminal behaviour.

However, it is essential—and the court reiterates—that such social adversity, while contextually relevant, does not constitute a justification or excuse for offending conduct. The rule of law, personal responsibility, and respect for others’ property remain foundational.

Additional procedural reflection may be offered on the chronic strain faced by the Probation Service in areas such as Hartwell. Staff shortages, case backlogs, and competing priorities often limit the capacity for sustained supervision or rehabilitative programming. The court hopes that investment in these services will be forthcoming, to support comprehensive offender management.

This case also brings to mind the inter-agency collaboration required in contemporary criminal justice. Multi-agency risk assessment conferences (MARACs) and the Management of Offenders by Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) exemplify protocols designed to balance community safety and individual rehabilitation. While neither was directly engaged here, the court acknowledges the institutional complexities surrounding such forums.

Victim Impact and Community Response  
The court has considered victim impact statements from the managers and employees of several stores affected by your offending. There is a recurring theme of distress and apprehension induced by your repeated appearances.

Some staff report feelings of intimidation, heightened anxiety, and disruptions to their working routines, including the need to implement additional security measures or reduce lone working hours. These are non-trivial consequences that extend beyond financial loss.

The Hartwell Retailers Association submitted a general statement addressing rising levels of theft in the borough, warning of the potential cascading effects on local commerce, employment, and community vitality.

Correspondence from local elected officials underscores concerns over the adequacy of policing responses, while commending individual officers for their steadfast commitment despite resource constraints.

In considering these matters, the court acknowledges the delicate balance between upholding community safety and ensuring proportionate justice for individuals caught in difficult circumstances.

Psychiatric and Psychological Assessments  
Dr Fiona Bartlett’s forensic psychological report—commissioned at the request of your legal team—provides a detailed examination of your mental state and risk profile. Dr Bartlett notes that while no major psychiatric disorder is evident, there are personality traits consistent with impulsivity and emotional dysregulation.

Substance misuse history is present but assessed as mild and currently stable. Engagement with treatment services has been inconsistent. The report cautiously recommends cognitive-behavioural interventions focusing on decision-making and impulse control.

The assessment acknowledges your expressed financial hardship and unstable accommodation, but emphasises the need for active participation in support mechanisms. The court places weight on this expert analysis in forming conclusions about risk and suitable sentencing options.

The court also notes ancillary reports from housing authorities and social support agencies detailing your precarious residency arrangements. Temporary accommodation provided through the Hartwell Housing Solutions Scheme reflects limited availability and short-term tenancies.

Consideration is also given to mitigating letters submitted on your behalf from community workers at the Riverside Day Centre, who describe your polite demeanour and willingness to engage, albeit sporadically, with available programs.

The emergency services have their own perspective. For example, the Hartwell Fire Brigade submitted a briefing note concerning a recent spate of deliberate fire-setting incidents in the vicinity of local shops. While unrelated to your conduct, such reports underscore the varied sources of risk facing public places and commercial premises.

The court expressly recognises the difficulties inherent in balancing rehabilitative hopes against public protection imperatives.

Analysis of Offending Behaviour  
It is appropriate now to address the circumstances of the offending for which you have been convicted, within the constraints of the consolidated charge. Evidence before the court demonstrates a sustained and calculated approach to shoplifting, characterised by repeated visits to certain stores where you exploited periods of low staff presence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}. The items taken include over-the-counter medications, personal care products, and convenience foods of relatively low individual value but cumulatively significant.

The modus operandi involves concealment of goods, occasional use of distraction techniques, and attempts to circumvent security measures such as electronic tags and CCTV observation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

Staff at victim premises describe a mounting sense of vulnerability and reduced confidence, leading to adjustments in working patterns and rostering to minimise lone working during your typical visiting hours.

The court is mindful that while no violence or threats were employed, the presence of persistent shoplifters can degrade workplace safety perception and morale.

Comparison with case law such as R v. Badsworth [2018] EWCA Crim 1234, where repeated shoplifting disrupted operations at a charity retail outlet, reinforces the principle that cumulative harm warrants a robust judicial response.

You have four prior convictions for theft offences, some of which involved community-based sanctions now breached or ineffective. Previous interventions have not produced lasting change, despite efforts by probation supervisors and community teams.

Sentencing Options and Framework  
Section 148 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 requires the court to consider the principle of sentencing individualisation — tailoring penalties to both the circumstances of the offence and the characteristics of the offender.

The guidelines encourage considering immediate custody where the offending exhibits persistence, planning, and disregard for community impact, particularly when accompanied by failure to engage with support services.

Community orders incorporating rehabilitative activity requirements, unpaid work, and cognitive skills programs remain available options, albeit contingent on the likelihood of compliance and effective risk management.

Probation reports are awaited to elucidate the feasibility of such measures and the optimal package of interventions.

Community protection measures and restorative justice offer further avenues, though their suitability depends on victim consent and offender insight.

This court is alive to the demands of public protection alongside rehabilitation and proportionate mercy. The challenge lies in balancing these often competing objectives to achieve outcomes that reduce harm and promote personal reform.

Adjournment and Next Steps  
Given the complexity of factors and the necessity of a comprehensive assessment, sentence will be deferred pending receipt of a pre-sentence report from the local probation office.

This will allow consideration of all relevant circumstances, including housing stability, engagement potential, and suitability for structured interventions.

Defence and prosecution representatives will be apprised of the report’s contents in accordance with standard practice, ensuring transparency and opportunity for submissions.

The court expressly acknowledges the professionalism of all parties, including the Registry staff who have managed the scheduling despite occasional clerical backlog exacerbated by COVID-19 related staffing shortages.

It is further noted that the recent refurbishment of Court 5 has improved facilities for vulnerable witnesses, reflecting ongoing efforts to enhance the justice environment.

Summary  
Mr H, the court has taken exhaustive account of your history, current circumstances, and the nature of your offending. The facts before the court demonstrate conduct that cannot be lightly dismissed, given its persistence and impact.

At the same time, you are not beyond the reach of rehabilitative opportunity. The forthcoming reports will assist the court in calibrating an appropriate response in the public interest.

These remarks are issued today, 14 September 2026, in Court 5 at Hartwell Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5.

You are reminded of your statutory right of appeal against sentence within 28 days, pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and section 31 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 currently apply. The question of costs is reserved for future determination.

These are the orders of the court.
