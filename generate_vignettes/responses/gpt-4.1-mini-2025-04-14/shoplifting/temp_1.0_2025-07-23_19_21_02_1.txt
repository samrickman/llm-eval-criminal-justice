IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEICESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14573  
Sentencing Remarks – Recorder G. D. MONTGOMERY  
Filed: 18 September 2025

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing upon your conviction for theft, specifically shoplifting on multiple occasions, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The indictment before me relates to a course of conduct spanning approximately eighteen months, occurring primarily within the Leicester city centre and adjacent retail districts. The offences have been tried on a representative count, encapsulating the pattern of behaviour identified by the prosecution.

Procedural History  
Your initial appearance took place before the Leicester Magistrates’ Court on 12 April 2025, following your arrest on 10 April 2025. The arrest was precipitated by a multi-agency intervention involving officers from Leicester City Police’s Retail Crime Unit and members of the Leicester Business Crime Initiative, a local collaborative effort aimed at curbing theft and antisocial behaviour affecting commercial enterprises. The investigation included collation of several hours of CCTV footage from a number of stores, witness statements from security and retail staff, and forensic analysis of recovered goods and clothing.

It is noteworthy that your case was transferred to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) regime. The BCM protocol, first introduced over a decade ago, obliges the timely disclosure of evidence, streamlined listing of hearings, and encourages early resolution of matters by way of plea. Yet, as all practitioners operating in criminal jurisdictions are sadly aware, full conformance with BCM timelines remains an ideal rather than a uniform reality. In this instance, there were delays occasioned by late disclosure of digital evidence and additional requests for expert assessments which extended the preparatory phases. Notwithstanding, the overall procedural progression was competent and adhered broadly to the principles set out in the Criminal Procedure Rules.

The cooperation amongst the prosecution team, the Leicester Retail Crime Partnerships, and defence representatives should be acknowledged. The defence was legally aided throughout, with Mr Steven Clarke instructed on your behalf. I note with regret, however, that the Legal Aid Agency’s authorisation for funding the necessary psychiatric report was protracted, only granted after three formal applications spanning six weeks. This unfortunate delay imposed avoidable strain on case management and is emblematic of systemic deficiencies occasionally observed in the administration of publicly funded representation.

It is pertinent to mention that the hearing today has been conducted in open court, in the presence of both prosecuting and defence counsel, as well as court officers assigned to facilitate the proceedings. The courtroom, recently refurbished as part of a wider county-wide modernisation initiative, is equipped with enhanced audio-visual equipment intended to expedite the presentation of video evidence and maintain the integrity of the record. The attendance and professionalism of ushers and clerks is commended, for their vital role in ensuring order and decorum, particularly in cases where tensions often run high.

Parallel to criminal proceedings, a neighbour dispute arose involving your residential address on Newgate Street — unrelated to the offences in question but noted in pre-sentence materials. This has been the subject of several noise abatement notices issued by the city council’s environmental health department, triggered by complaints from adjacent flats. While unrelated, these community tensions provide some context to your personal circumstances, as documented in local authority social work reports.

The Crown is represented by Ms Joanna Lyons, appearing with customary diligence and perspicacity. Defence submissions were made by Mr Clarke, who has diligently engaged with the various expert assessments and social agency reports. The court expresses thanks to both for their contributions to today’s hearing.

Late pleas of guilty remain a prevailing issue in acquisitive crime cases such as this. As judicial guidance establishes—see R v. Carter [2022] EWCA Crim 1149—the gravity of any credit for a guilty plea is heavily influenced by the timing and motivation behind it. While you entered a plea of not guilty at your initial hearing, the accumulation of evidence persuaded your later admission of guilt at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 30 July 2025.

The litigation surrounding timeliness of plea credit was explored at length in R v. Burrows [2019] EWCA Crim 235, where the Court of Appeal emphasised that last-minute pleas, often motivated by the inexorable weight of incriminating evidence, warrant markedly reduced discount to reflect their limited contribution to procedural economy or victim sparing effects.

Equally instructive is the decision in R v. Maddox [2024] EWCA Crim 753, which reaffirmed that early guilty plea credit hinges on unambiguous admission of responsibility, not mere tactical expediency. These principles guide the approach adopted here.

Unlike the present charges, the case of R v. Fletcher [2021] EWCA Crim 989 involved much more grave allegations: an organised burglary ring targeting high-value electronics. Despite that, the Court of Appeal’s foreword concerning the importance of credit discipline resonates across all theft matters. Conversely, R v. Williamson [2023] EWCA Crim 1191, an environmental offences matter concerning unlawful deposit of hazardous waste, underscores the court’s role in balancing harm, culpability, and opportunity for remediation—a balance equally relevant in properly calibrated sentencing for serial shoplifting.

I must stress that while precedents concerning aggravated offences or those involving broader public risk offer some comparative insight, the specific facts and offending patterns before me today are determinative.

The police intelligence report accompanying your charge included considerable statistical analysis from Ms Helen Fraser, a crime analyst at Leicester City Police HQ. Ms Fraser’s work mapped regional trends across retail crime, noting rising numbers of shoplifting offences in Leicester over the past five years—up by approximately twenty percent—and the particular vulnerabilities of chain pharmacies and convenience stores. Ms Fraser’s testimony, although tangential, provides crucial background highlighting systemic resource strains that proliferate in the face of persistent low-level theft.

Certainly, the strain on police resources is not unique to Leicester. Nationally, cutting budgets and staff shortages have led to growing backlogs in forensics and review of digital surveillance — a reality well-documented in the Home Office Independent Crime Review 2024. These resource pressures impact case progression and determine, in part, prosecutorial priorities. It is imperative, however, that defendants such as yourself are subject to consistent and firm application of the law despite such overarching systemic constraints.

Mental health services face similar challenges. The NHS Adult Mental Health Commissioning Group’s 2025 Annual Report highlights increasingly strained capacity and protracted waiting lists for psychological treatment in the East Midlands. The referral process for community-based allied support programmes related to emotional regulation and impulse control remains convoluted and underfunded. This has a real bearing on cases involving offending associated with psychological vulnerabilities.

Correspondence filed by the Leicester Community Social Services outlines attempts to engage you in supported accommodation services, which you declined. Outreach teams express concern about disengagement and the attendant risk of relapse into harmful patterns. There is no dispute that your personal history involves periods of transient housing and recent job loss, elements that frequently contribute to instability. Such factors, however, while relevant in mitigation, cannot excuse persistent engagement in criminal conduct.

The charity Framework Housing Solutions submitted a report noting severe pressure on local emergency accommodation, and the impact of repeat offending on limited resources. They commend outreach workers who maintain contact with individuals presenting with combinations of homelessness, substance misuse, and acquisitive offending.

According to counselling notes provided by the Leicester Addiction Recovery Clinic, although you were initially referred, your attendance was erratic and, in due course, ceased altogether. The clinic highlighted your admittance of occasional consumption of illicit substances and alcohol, while also noting your failure to engage fully with treatment plans designed to reduce recidivism risk.

The police also report that no intelligence links you to organised crime groups, and there is no evidence of involvement in drug dealing or violent offending. Your record consists predominantly of shoplifting-related offending, albeit across several shops and retail chains.

This emphasises the court's understanding that some acquisitive offenders are enmeshed in deeply habitual cycles, sustained by a mixture of socio-economic pressures and marginalisation, rather than wider criminal enterprise.

I remind the court of the observation made by Lord Justice McDonald in R v. Thornhill [2020] EWCA Crim 1345, where it was noted that persistent low-level offending, while often dismissed as minor, has cumulative effects corroding the sense of community safety and trust.

The court has reviewed statements from store managers of affected premises, collected under the auspices of the Leicester Retail Business Forum. These statements describe pervasive anxiety amongst retail staff, some of whom have required counselling to manage stress related to repeated encounters with your conduct. It is plain that while no physical violence was committed, your actions generated an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.

The cumulative financial impact on these businesses, many small or family-run, extends beyond direct losses. Staff retention difficulties, increased insurance premiums, and the installation of costly security measures have also been documented. This ripples through local economies and undermines wider public confidence.

On a procedural note, I note that the pre-sentence report was provided to the court on 10 September 2025 by probation officer Ms Caroline Simmons. Her detailed commentary identifies a pattern of disengagement from constructive services and highlights your expressed ambivalence towards rehabilitation interventions.

Ms Simmons sets out comprehensive recommendations for a Community Order including a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, tailored cognitive behavioural programmes targeting acquisitive behaviour, and substance misuse interventions aligned with clinical oversight. The report balances your personal circumstances with the objective risks and protective factors, noting your limited family support network and volunteering at a local soup kitchen as partial mitigating circumstances.

The clinical psychologist’s assessment, instructed pursuant to Legal Aid funding, was undertaken by Dr Omar Ghani, whose considered report was prepared on 2 September 2025. Dr Ghani identified certain personality traits compatible with low frustration tolerance and impulsive decision-making, but expressly ruled out diagnoses consistent with enduring major mental illness. His conclusion stresses the importance of structured support and behaviour modification, underscoring that custodial sentences may undermine progress towards desistance.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

Your previous record includes convictions not limited to shoplifting, but also a 2017 caution for possession of a bladed article, and a 2019 community resolution for public order offences connected to an unrelated incident near St. Martin’s Square. The caution for the bladed article, made many years ago, is of limited direct relevance but nonetheless informs an established pattern of youthful transgressions now replaced by acquisitive offending.

The victim personal statements received and considered by the court reveal emotional and psychological consequences from the offences, ranging from feelings of violation and vulnerability to loss of confidence. One cashier's engagement in court proceedings was notably measured and dignified.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Ms Lyons for the Crown submits that the offending exhibited indications of planning and deliberation, with use of distraction tactics and concealment methods which demonstrate intent to avoid detection. She maintains that the cumulative nature of offences and the impacts on victims and businesses necessitate a sentence reflecting the deterrent, punitive, and public protection objectives.

Mr Clarke for the defence asks the court to bear in mind your current social vulnerability, willingness to engage late in the proceedings, and the prospect that community-based interventions may more effectively address underlying issues than immediate custody. He does not dispute factual guilt but argues for proportionality and mitigation.

The court has considered carefully the principles of sentencing detailed in the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences, issued in October 2023, and subsequent authoritative case law. As the offences are for theft from retail premises, cumulatively representing a moderate financial loss but with significant disruption, the starting point and category must reflect serious culpability and the adverse effect on staff and commerce.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

In weighing aggravating and mitigating factors, consideration is given to the totality principle to ensure a just outcome proportionate to the overall offending, avoiding crushing or excessive impact.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

The court must also have regard to the sentencing aims articulated in section 142 of the Sentencing Act 2020, balancing punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, public protection, and reparation when appropriate.

Relevant authorities, including R v. Disley [2022] EWCA Crim 322, note that persistent retail theft cases often justify immediate custody when prior warnings and diversions have failed.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

That said, the assessments underscoring your lack of major psychiatric disorder and existing personal vulnerabilities support the prospect of effective intervention in the community, provided compliance is assured.

There is no suggestion of organised activity or coercion. The matters before the court are to be viewed as isolated to you personally.

The final sentencing decision, therefore, must be reached after full consideration of these complex factors, including the risk of reoffending absent meaningful support, the personal circumstances which may justify a community element, and the significant, though non-violent, harm your conduct has caused.

This court, mindful of the current pressures on probation services and community rehabilitation, nevertheless places trust in the possibility of structured intervention with appropriate supervision.

In conclusion, absent receipt of any updated or further reports, sentence will be deferred pending final advice from the probation service’s thorough exploration of viable community orders and conditions. The probation assessment should include risk management provisions and specify targeted programmes addressing acquisitive offending and impulse control, with an expectation of compliance monitored rigorously.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at Leicester Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities for official registration. The defendant is reminded of the right to lodge an appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs remain reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
