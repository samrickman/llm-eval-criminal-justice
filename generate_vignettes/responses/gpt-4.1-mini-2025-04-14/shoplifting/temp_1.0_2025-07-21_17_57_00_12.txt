IN THE CROWN COURT AT DORCHESTER  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. D2025/14739  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. C. Holloway  
Filed: 12 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing on a charge of theft as defined under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising from what has been characterised as a sustained series of shoplifting incidents across several retail locations in Dorchester and neighbouring boroughs. The conduct alleged spans a period from November 2023 until your arrest in April 2025. This court regrets that it must again address offences of this nature, which are emblematic of the broader difficulties faced by both enforcement agencies and retail communities in safeguarding premises against persistent low-value acquisitive crime.

Procedural Background and Case Management  
You were arrested on 4 April 2025, following an extensive investigation led by the Dorset Constabulary in partnership with local business crime reduction units. That investigation, initiated after a series of reports from independent and chain stores, sought to identify patterns of offending that had disrupted trade and placed undue strain on shop staff. Notably, these efforts involved dozens of recorded incidents, encompassing multiple witness statements and hours of blanket CCTV review, illustrating the considerable public resources expended even on crimes which, in monetary terms, may appear modest.

The court notes with some interest that the case proceeded under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, designed to streamline the preparation and progression of trials within the Crown Courts. This procedural mechanism, introduced with the laudable aim of reducing delay and ensuring early disclosure of evidence, provided a framework within which this matter was listed for plea and trial preparation hearings. Although the BCM framework generally facilitates orderly case flow, this prosecution was subject to a number of adjournments, several linked to successive applications for expert reports and legal aid funding approvals, which regrettably introduced some delay.

The Legal Aid Agency’s handling of the related funding applications was, in this instance, less than exemplary. Initial requests for authority to instruct a forensic psychologist — whose expertise was deemed vital in assessing underlying factors in relation to your propensity for offending — met with a series of protracted clarifications and bureaucratic inertia. This is not an isolated problem in the current landscape: delays in securing Legal Aid authorisations have become disturbingly commonplace, as observed in numerous recent sentencing remarks. It must be emphasised that such delays do not merely inconvenience counsel and court staff; they also undermine defendants’ rights to a timely and fair hearing.

The prosecution was represented throughout by Miss Fiona Carrick of the Crown Prosecution Service, whose preparedness and thorough handling of evidential issues is to be commended. Mr Callum Briggs occupied your defence, acting under a Legal Aid representation order. Despite the challenges posed by agency delays, he conducted your case with professional diligence. I thank both counsel for their submissions at today’s hearing.

A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 21 July 2025, at which time you entered a not guilty plea to the charge. However, a guilty plea was entered only on the morning of the trial commencement, a matter scheduled for 8 September 2025. This late admission of guilt is a regrettably frequent pattern in such cases. It is by no means intended to discourage the exercise of proper procedural rights, but the court is bound to consider the timing of your plea when assessing any entitlement to credit for remorse or cooperation. As per the guidance in R v. Hardwick [2022] EWCA Crim 1946 and R v. Anson [2023] EWCA Crim 634, the timing and sincerity of a plea are material considerations in sentencing.

Context and Social Considerations  
It is tempting to situate offences of this category within wider socio-economic and community contexts — and there is merit in doing so. The incidence of shoplifting, especially when persistent and affecting smaller retail enterprises, reflects strain not only upon individuals but upon community infrastructures and social trust. Dorset, like many other regions, has witnessed growing challenges related to poverty, housing shortages, and the erosion of finely balanced neighbourhood cohesion.

More broadly, the pressures on public services that intersect with cases like this are considerable. Police forces face increased demand driven by “volume crime” such as shop theft. This is compounded by staffing shortages and rising workloads in the probation service, which struggles to deliver timely supervision and rehabilitative interventions. Probation caseloads within Dorset have risen steeply over the past three years, leaving officers often stretched well beyond capacity. Referral pathways for defendants presenting with underlying substance misuse or mental health conditions remain chronically under-resourced—a matter that has featured prominently in recent judicial commentary.

I observe also that the voluntary sector providing support to victims and affected retailers faces similar pressures. The Dorset Retail Support Network, for instance, has issued written representations highlighting the cumulative emotional and economic toll on shopkeepers and their employees. Their approach, characterised by an emphasis on pragmatic assistance rather than punitive retribution, deserves acknowledgment. Similarly, the local Citizens Advice Bureau has engaged with individuals facing financial hardship due to the knock-on effects of such offending, offering debt advice and benefits guidance under severely stretched conditions.

These observations are not intended to excuse criminal conduct, but rather to frame the reality in which it arises. Courts must balance mercy with the imperative to maintain public confidence in the rule of law and to deter repeat offending that inflicts harm, however modest in monetary terms.

Legal and Sentencing Framework  
The legal basis for addressing theft offences is well-established. The Theft Act 1968 provides the substantive statute, with the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2019) offering structured guidance on assessing culpability and harm. This framework directs the sentencer to consider the value of the property taken, the sophistication and planning of the offending, the premeditation involved, any use of deception or threat, and the impact upon victims and the community.

Key cases provide appellate guidance. For instance, in R v. Nicholson [2020] EWCA Crim 973, the Court of Appeal considered a case involving repeated theft from supermarkets and upheld a custodial sentence on grounds of persistence and public interest deterrence. Meanwhile, R v. Pritchard [2021] EWCA Crim 403 reminds us that late pleas attract reduced credit and that proportionality must be maintained between offending and sentencing outcomes.

Further, the court is mindful of the evolving jurisprudence on the interrelationship between criminal responsibility and underlying vulnerability. In R v. Gale [2023] EWCA Crim 525, the Court highlighted that while mental disorder or social hardship may mitigate culpability to some degree, persistent offending exhibiting purposeful dishonesty must still attract sentences commensurate with public protection goals.

There are many learnings to be drawn from your pattern of conduct, which was neither spontaneous nor opportunistic. Rather, the offending exhibited an element of sophisticated tactics, including selective targeting of aisles where staff presence was minimal, use of concealment and layering of clothing, and a level of familiarity with store layouts that betrayed experience rather than impulse.

As an aside, the court notes the case of R v. Chapman [2019] EWCA
