IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. C2025/43892  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. F. KENDRICK  
Filed: 12 August 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction on a representative count of theft, arising from a series of incidents of shoplifting targeting multiple retail establishments within the Bristol metropolitan area. The prosecution has identified a course of conduct extending over approximately eighteen months, culminating in your arrest last December. The offending pattern involves repeated entries into shops, where items of modest but cumulative value were appropriated without payment.  

Procedural History  
Your initial appearance before the magistrates’ court occurred on 11 January 2025. The case was promptly committed for trial at the Crown Court due to the nature of the alleged conduct and the volume of evidence to be addressed. The listing of the plea and trial preparation hearing was delayed, in part, due to pressures on court resources and conflicting case management priorities within the Bristol Crown Court centre. This court is acutely aware of the operational challenges faced by courts nationally, including staffing shortages among clerical officers, intermittent industrial action among court security personnel, and the complexities introduced by the ongoing modernisation of digital case management systems.  

Following your initial not guilty plea on 9 February 2025, case progression was further affected by defense counsel’s applications for an expert psychiatric report, requiring authorisation from the Legal Aid Agency. The process was protracted, occasioned by multiple requests for supplementary information and the referral to an independent consultant with expertise in acquisitive offending behaviours. The delays incurred, while regrettable, are illustrative of a system burdened by competing priorities, with Legal Aid frameworks operating under considerable financial and administrative constraint.  

The Better Case Management (BCM) framework, introduced nationally to streamline criminal trials and encourage early resolution where appropriate, was observed in this case insofar as its provisions could be implemented given the administrative delays. Nonetheless, the final resolution was only achieved following your change of plea to guilty on 14 June 2025, well after the original trial window had been set for late May. There is a demonstrable pattern within this jurisdiction of defendants delaying guilty pleas until evidence has become overwhelming, as observed in successive cases such as R v Colson [2019] EWCA Crim 951 and R v Ellington [2022] EWCA Crim 1147.  

The court acknowledges the professional diligence of all parties in managing this case, notwithstanding the systemic challenges. In particular, Ms Natalie Ridges, appearing for the Crown, presented her submissions clearly and with appropriate regard to prosecutorial discretion, whilst Mr Giles Fortner, instructed for the defence, maintained rigorous advocacy under the constraints imposed by the complex factual matrix.  

It is worth noting, as background, that the legal framework under which you are sentenced is governed principally by section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, which defines theft as “the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.” This unchanging statutory basis underpins the court’s adjudicatory function, notwithstanding the evolving social context in which acquisitive offences take place today. Indeed, in Attorney-General’s Reference No. 2 of 1983 (1985) AC 905, Lord Roskill emphasised the foundational role of this legislative provision in criminal property offences.  

Several interlocutory orders affected the timetable of this case, including an adjournment granted in May to permit the receipt of further victims’ impact statements from a range of small independent shopkeepers and larger retail chains. These accounts, whilst repetitive in detail, underscored the ongoing strain experienced by frontline retail workers. I will return to this point shortly.  

Reflecting more broadly on the contemporary landscape, one cannot divorce such offending from the increasing pressures faced by public institutions charged with managing crime and its consequences. The National Retailers' Association continues to report mounting incidents of shop theft nationally, a factor which has led to the establishment of Business Crime Reduction Partnerships (BCRPs) in various regions. While these partnerships intend to foster collaborative policing and rapid intelligence sharing, they are not immune to challenges stemming from fluctuating personnel, budgetary constraints, and data protection regulations. Despite these hurdles, the local Bristol BCRP functioned with reasonable efficacy in collating evidence and supporting the prosecution, an effort to be commended amidst trying conditions.  

In parallel, the role of the community voluntary sector is increasingly pivotal, as statutory agencies face stretched resources. Charitable entities such as Bristol Support Network and the Retail Workers’ Wellbeing Fund have provided support and counselling to affected individuals. Their submissions to the court highlight both the immediate and enduring consequences of repeated theft on staff morale and mental health.  

Historical sentencing authorities remain pertinent. The case of R v Steed [2016] EWCA Crim 478 is repeatedly cited for affirming that persistent shoplifting, even where each act in isolation may seem minor, cumulatively warrants a punitive and deterrent approach. Equally, R v Craig [2018] EWCA Crim 195 underlines the significance of harm beyond mere financial loss, encapsulating the distress and fear engendered in victims and retail employees. Such harm is less tangible but no less real.  

Of note too is the Court of Appeal decision in R v Jowitt [2023] EWCA Crim 902, which considered the procedural propriety of credit reductions in cases of late pleas in property offences. The court reiterated that while a guilty plea remains a mitigating factor, the stage at which it is entered has a material impact on credit to be awarded. This is reflective of the principles set out in the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on culpability and harm.  

Incidentally, the case list for this court on the day of sentencing also included a prosecution for affray arising from disturbances in a public house involving several individuals wielding pool cues—a matter entirely unrelated but indicative of the varied nature of criminal conduct encountered within this jurisdiction.  

The period of January 2025 to March 2025 witnessed an increased volume of retail crime reports, coinciding with the winter sales period, a time historically associated with both elevated commercial activity and opportunistic offending. Your conduct must be viewed against this backdrop, though not excused thereby.  

On 30 March 2025, this court was informed that a co-defendant in a separate case awaiting trial had failed to appear and was currently the subject of a warrant for arrest. This circumstance, while irrelevant to your own case, is an example of the challenges facing the justice system in balancing resources and managing offender compliance.  

Additionally, it is acknowledged that the administrative staff supporting judicial proceedings in Court 4 at Bristol recently completed refurbishment works, resulting in improved facilities but also contributing to occasional delays in case processing during the transitional period.  

The recruitment and retention difficulties currently confronting probation services continue to place strain on the preparation of pre-sentence reports and risk assessments. The probation officer assigned in your case, Ms Karen Bellamy, submitted a timely report, though modified timescales were agreed to accommodate her concurrent caseload demands.  

A number of letters of support, including correspondence from your sister, Ms Yvonne H., and local housing advocates, were tendered on your behalf. These documents, duly considered, speak to your personal circumstances and ongoing housing instability. While such information is relevant, it is not determinative of sentence.  

It is unfortunate, as has been previously noted in this jurisdiction, that Legal Aid delays once again featured prominently in the case management timeline. Your defense counsel’s initial request to instruct a forensic psychologist was met with protracted consideration by the Legal Aid Agency, delaying progress by approximately six weeks. Such administrative lag undermines the principles of timely justice and places added pressure on the court and participants.  

You were arrested on 18 December 2024, following an operation that incorporated a range of investigatory techniques including covert observation, the use of plainclothes officers, and analysis of CCTV footage from multiple retail premises within central Bristol. The digital forensic capacity managed by the Avon and Somerset Police was instrumental in consolidating the case against you, with examination of data from mobile communication devices being pivotal evidence.  

It is recognised that such deployments involve considerable resource commitment, both in officer time and technical expertise, as documented in the Home Office’s 2023 report on digital investigative workloads. Such resource allocation represents a tangible public investment, underscoring the seriousness with which repeat shops theft is regarded.  

In addition to police activity, the role of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership was notable. Their intelligence collation and coordination with local law enforcement enhanced responsiveness and fostered operational synergy. This partnership, while not flawless, exemplifies multi-agency cooperation aimed at reducing commercial victimisation.  

Despite these efforts, the challenge of curbing retail theft remains multifaceted, complicated not only by social factors but by technological limitations. The use of covert recording and electronic tag deactivation, for instance, requires constant vigilance and adaptive policing tactics.

Your offending demonstrated a methodical approach, utilising bags, layered clothing, and timing that evidenced awareness of store routines and security measures. Such planning indicates a deliberate course of criminal behaviour rather than mere opportunism.  

Research in the field of criminal psychology notes that such offences often blend impulsive acts with calculated steps, a confluence that presents particular challenges in both prevention and rehabilitation.  

Furthermore, the history of your convictions, including prior shoplifting offences, indicates a pattern of recidivism. Past interventions, including a conditional discharge and a community resolution imposed in 2021, failed to deter your conduct. This persistence, regrettably, increases the gravity of your present offence in the eyes of the law.

The victim impact statements reveal not merely monetary loss but an erosion of confidence among retail staff and management. Several employees reported increased anxiety, with some requesting overtime adjustments to avoid lone working periods during which your conduct was prevalent. Such consequences, whilst intangible, merit serious consideration.  

The Retail Workers’ Union further contributed an exposition on the adverse mental health effects routinely experienced by members subjected to repeat theft and associated threats, a factor that compounds the public interest in an effective sentencing response.

The economic ramifications for smaller businesses, operating on tight margins, are considerable. Closures, shelving reductions, and increased security expenditure are downstream effects reverberating through local communities. Again, while you may not have personally intended these consequences, they are incontrovertibly linked to your offending pattern.

Expert Assessments  
The forensic psychiatric report prepared by Dr Robert Finlay, consultant forensic psychiatrist, offers a comprehensive analysis of your mental health status. Dr Finlay concludes that there is no evidence of major mental disorder but identifies traits consistent with impulsivity and intermittent substance misuse. The report suggests that your criminality is best understood as behavioural rather than clinically driven.  

Dr Finlay makes recommendations for engagement with structured cognitive-behavioural interventions focusing on impulsivity control and relapse prevention. He notes the absence of overt psychosis, mood disorder, or personality disorder requiring specialist clinical treatment, but underscores the importance of multi-agency support in addressing criminogenic needs.  

The probation service assessment echoes these findings, highlighting a medium likelihood of reoffending if underlying behavioural triggers are unaddressed.  The allocated probation officer stresses the need for your meaningful cooperation with rehabilitation programmes, including debt management and vocational training.  

It is regrettable that you have declined offers of assistance from local hardship services, including financial counselling and addiction support provided by Bristol Helping Hands. The refusal to engage with such facilities limits the prospect of meaningful reform without judicial intervention.  

The court acknowledges that your housing situation remains precarious, with temporary accommodation provided through council arrangements. The broader difficulties of housing supply and affordability are well documented nationally and locally; however, such instability cannot be regarded as an excuse for criminal conduct.  

Similarly, I note the submissions made by your sister, who details longstanding familial solidarity amid hardship, though practical support has been intermittent. These matters inform but do not excuse your legal responsibility.  

Sentencing Framework and Considerations  
The Sentencing Council’s offences guideline directs this court to weigh several factors, paramount among them the seriousness of the offence, the harm caused, your culpability, and the impact of any mitigating features including plea timing and personal mitigation.  

The court accords measured but limited credit for your plea entered just under two months after arrest and following extensive evidence gathering and pre-trial preparation. This timing precludes maximum discount but recognises a degree of acceptance sufficient to reduce sentence marginally from what would otherwise be appropriate.  

In terms of harm, though no physical injury or threat was occasioned, the stealing of essential goods from community stores cumulatively undermines the social fabric and inflicts distress on vulnerable retail workers. Aggravating factors include the premeditated nature of your conduct and the repetition despite prior warnings.  

The court is mindful of the evolving jurisprudence concerning sentences for repeated acquisitive offences, with increasing emphasis on deterrence balanced against rehabilitation potential. Cases such as R v Sinclair [2024] EWCA Crim 276 and R v Burke [2023] EWCA Crim 733 exemplify this dual mandate.  

Given your age, prior convictions, partial engagement with supportive services, and absence of serious mental health disorders, this court is inclined to explore community-based options with stringent supervisory arrangements, provided that the pre-sentence report supports this course. Immediate custody remains a possibility depending on the full assessment.  

There is, additionally, the alternative of a suspended sentence coupled with a rehabilitation activity requirement, coupled with structured unpaid work. Such a disposition may align with public interest in your prompt reintegration, whilst affording suitable reparation to local businesses.  

The court is, however, well aware that the prudent management of cases of this nature depends heavily on probation service capacity, which remains stretched. The continued shortfall in probation officer numbers—and the consequent impact on meaningful offender supervision—is a source of concern recognised by the Ministry of Justice and discussed in recent Parliamentary committee reports. This reality must be factored into sentencing decisions insofar as it affects the practical enforceability of non-custodial orders.  

The interests of justice and public protection must be balanced with the need to avoid imposing conditions likely to be ineffective or unenforceable, a conundrum faced daily in this jurisdiction. No doubt effective engagement by you, supported by your defense team and probation, will be critical moving forward.  

In conclusion, Mr H, the court has carefully considered the extensive written and oral submissions from Crown and defense counsel, the contents of the psychiatric report, victim impact statements, the probation assessment, and your personal circumstances. The wider social and institutional context of this offence has also been borne in mind, including ongoing pressures on police, probation, NHS mental health services, and housing allocations.  

The necessarily detailed and procedural nature of these remarks, and the interspersed references to relevant authorities and frameworks, reflects the court’s obligation to ensure transparency, fairness and consistency in sentencing. This approach, while sometimes verbose and painstaking, serves the fundamental principles of open justice.  

In accordance with established practice, sentencing is adjourned to allow for the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. This report shall include assessment of your suitability for available community rehabilitation programmes, including cognitive skills training and any ancillary support services that may assist in addressing the underlying causes of your offending.  

The matter will be listed for sentence on 2 October 2025, where the court will take into account the probation recommendation, any further representations, and any mitigation you may wish to advance personally or through counsel. Meanwhile, you must continue to comply with bail conditions as previously ordered.  

These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 12 August 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The record of conviction and sentence will be communicated to all relevant statutory agencies and entered on the appropriate national registers. You are reminded of your statutory right to appeal against sentence within 28 days, under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions have been placed under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved at this stage.  

These are the orders of the court.
