IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/14408  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge S. L. PETERSON  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court facing sentence following your conviction for the offence of theft from retail premises, commonly known as shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This offence forms part of a broader pattern of repeated thefts from various retail outlets within the metropolitan and suburban areas of Birmingham over a period exceeding twelve months, concluding in early 2025.

The historical and procedural context of this matter warrants extended elaboration, for it is against this backdrop that your offending must be assessed. The present case was listed originally on 18 May 2025 in the magistrates’ court. Following an initial hearing and a committal procedure, the matter was scheduled for trial at this Crown Court under the established principle that offences involving persistent acquisitive conduct are properly the province of this higher tier of criminal jurisdiction. The transfer to the Crown Court reflects not only the scale and repetition of offending but also the complexity introduced by multiple witness statements, voluminous CCTV evidence, and the necessary consideration of appropriate sentencing outcomes informed by current legal standards and public interest.  

It is pertinent to record that the Crown Prosecution Service initially discharged eight separate charges and consolidated twelve remaining offences into a single representative count to facilitate efficient prosecution while preserving the ability to depict the pattern of behaviour appropriately.

The case has been subject to the operation of the Better Case Management procedures, as introduced pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 3, which seek to ensure timely progression of proceedings and avoid undue delays characteristic of longer-drawn trials. I acknowledge that despite these procedural measures, there were inevitable adjournments in the present case, most notably caused by applications for additional forensic analysis and requests from the defence for expert psychiatric evaluation, which necessitated some re-listing of hearings. Such instances, while regrettable, are not uncommon given the demands of a case of this nature in our increasingly burdened criminal justice system.  

The issue of legal aid funding proved, once again, a significant administrative obstacle. On 2 June 2025, the defence submitted an application for funding to instruct a forensic psychiatrist with expertise in compulsive offending and impulse control disorders. This application languished for over four weeks before approval was granted on 5 July 2025, following intervention from the defendant’s instructing solicitor and repeated correspondence raising concerns over delay. While the court appreciates the constraints faced by the Legal Aid Agency, such delays threaten the fairness and timeliness of proceedings and should be the object of systemic review.  

The need for expert psychiatric assessment arose primarily due to the defence’s assertion of mitigating factors related to mental health vulnerabilities. That said, the pre-sentence psychological report—received on 10 September 2025 and authored by Dr Amanda Ling, Consultant Clinical Forensic Psychologist—did not identify any major psychiatric disorder. Dr Ling observed “personality traits characterised by impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and a degree of social isolation” but did not find clinical evidence of a formal diagnosis warranting hospitalisation or direct therapeutic sanction. Her report remarked on the absence of any diagnosed psychotic illness, mood disorder, or neurocognitive impairment that might otherwise substantially interfere with your criminal responsibility.  

The report underscored an increased risk of reoffending related to ongoing socioeconomic hardship, limited engagement with support services, and persistent substance misuse, notably the misuse of over-the-counter analgesics in ways described as “self-medicating behaviour,” which may complicate motivation and impulse control. Notably, Dr Ling emphasised that “while Mr H’s engagement with proposed interventions has been inconsistent, there remains potential for rehabilitation through structured community orders incorporating mental health and addiction support.”  

These observations lead the court to consider the intersection of your personal circumstances with the public interest in protection, deterrence, and rehabilitation. It must be borne in mind that the Probation Service is currently operating under unprecedented resource constraints, with staffing levels at roughly 70% of recommended establishment in the West Midlands region. This inevitably impacts the availability and intensity of supervision and rehabilitative programming. Nonetheless, vigorous efforts have been made in your case to engage you with support, including referrals to the Birmingham Addiction Outreach Team, the local Money Advice Service, and a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) group addressing acquired antisocial behaviour. The letters of support submitted by outreach workers detail a pattern of partial compliance with appointment schedules, interrupted by episodes of disengagement and non-attendance.  

A letter dated 7 September 2025, from Ms Sandra Holley, Community Liaison Officer of the Birmingham Business Crime Reduction Partnership, was submitted. The letter details the cumulative impact of your offending on local independent retailers and highlights the strain imposed on staff morale, security expenditure, and store profitability. Ms Holley’s correspondence notes that while no physical violence was recorded, repeated encounters produced a “climate of anxiety and fear” among frontline workers, some of whom reduced working hours or sought redeployment.  

The voluminous nature of the prosecution case is accentuated by the detailed evidence gathered via closed-circuit television, witness statements, stock reconciliations, and forensic analysis of recovered goods from your possession upon arrest. On 15 March 2025, a multi-agency operation encompassing the West Midlands Police Retail Crime Unit, Birmingham City Trading Standards, and the local authority’s Community Safety Department culminated in your apprehension.  

Given the volume and detail of evidence, the conviction resulted from a guilty plea entered at the earliest realistic opportunity, specifically on 9 August 2025, during the plea and case management hearing. It must be reiterated that early pleas represent an important mitigating factor and assist in conserving public resources; they spare witnesses the ordeal of trial and contribute positively to the administration of justice. Credit will be accorded accordingly, though appropriately moderated to reflect the overall seriousness of the course of offending.  

The court pauses to note the ever-present limitations of reliance on CCTV evidence in retail theft prosecutions. While the ubiquity of camera technology presents a seemingly powerful tool for evidence collation, the reality is more nuanced. Operative limitations include poor image resolution, occluded angles, and periodic recording failures. The necessity of manual review, often involving protracted hours of examination by officers and retail staff alike, adds to investigative workload. Security footage, while often compelling, rarely tells the full story in isolation and requires corroborative testimony and forensic support. Resource demands on victim agencies, who are often small businesses with limited administrative capacity, remain a matter of ongoing concern.  

Against this procedural tableau, I turn to the legal principles governing sentencing in theft offences. The Theft Act 1968 remains the foundational statute, with section 1 articulating the requisites for criminal liability. The courts have long recognised that shoplifting, particularly when habitual, must be met with firm response proportional to the harm caused—the harm, in these cases, being not only the economic loss suffered by retailers but also the wider erosion of community confidence and the demoralisation of shop staff.  

Recent appellate authority provides guidance. In R v. Fenwick [2024] EWCA Crim 1051, the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial term for a defendant convicted of a sustained course of shoplifting involving multiple independent stores over two years. The defendant’s strategy, involving distraction techniques and use of accomplices, mirrored a sophisticated approach designed to subvert detection. The sentencing court emphasised the need to address not only the financial loss but the "psychological toll imposed on retail employees routinely targeted and surveilled." That judgment reinforces the proposition that even in the absence of overt violence or intimidation, repetitive acquisitive offending can underpin substantial custodial sentences.  

Conversely, R v. Palmer [2022] EWCA Crim 427, a case involving theft of low-value convenience goods committed under duress by a defendant suffering severe financial hardship, saw the court affirm community-based sentences where rehabilitation prospects were demonstrably strong. While that case bears some resemblance to yours—especially in the domain of socioeconomic difficulty—the distinction lies in the level of engagement with support services and the admission of responsibility at an early stage, both of which are more equivocal in your circumstances.

I must also mention the judgment in R v. Dwyer [2023] EWCA Crim 778 concerning a defendant who committed theft within a school vicinity and was charged with possession of a bladed article in a location of special concern. While that case involved additional offences, including the possession of a prohibited weapon, and was not directly analogous, it serves to remind that courts must consider the broader context of offending—including proximity to vulnerable populations and the wider community impact—when formulating sentences.  

Equally pertinent is R v. Newton [2020] EWCA Crim 999, a case arising from a Newton hearing where the defendant challenged the prosecution’s acceptance of culpability, resulting in detailed examination of evidence and witness reliability. In that matter, the Court of Appeal underscored the salary in appropriate credit for guilty pleas timed to procedures, which is no less relevant here.  

Turning now to the facts of the offending, as conventionally outlined, I am obliged to sketch the narrative of criminal behaviour for which you have been found culpable, though in this document the core details will be supplemented by placeholder notation as per agreed protocol. The facts demonstrate a deliberate and repeated pattern of entry into retail premises with the intention to appropriate goods without lawful payment. Items targeted were frequently of modest monetary value but cumulatively amounted to substantial loss.

These thefts occurred principally during afternoon and early evening hours, with your conduct characterised by marked circumstantial opportunism, notably exploiting moments when staff attentiveness was reduced, such as shift handovers or during peak customer influx.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

Witness testimony details behaviour suggestive of planned execution, including the concealment of items in personal belongings, use of distractions involving interlocutors, and in certain cases, the sequential removal of anti-theft tags.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

The impact on staff was pronounced, with one employee providing evidence of emotional distress and repeated anxiety, actively altering working patterns as a direct consequence of your offending.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

The Crown further contends, supported by independent loss adjustor valuations, that the cumulative financial impact on small businesses was substantial, causing some to implement costly security upgrades and revise procedures at their own expense.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

While violence or threat thereof did not feature as aggravating factors, the predatory nature of repeated incursions into trusted environments fosters an undercurrent of fear that dissuades normal community commerce and undermines social cohesion.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

In mitigation, the defence emphasises your report of entrenched unemployment, unstable housing, and intermittent substance misuse, arguing that these factors are contributory but not determinative.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

The probation service’s pre-sentence report reflects concerns about your lack of meaningful engagement with prior community resolutions and restorative justice schemes, noting a disappointing pattern of desistence failure.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

It is necessary to express the court’s gratitude to the numerous witnesses—retail staff, store managers, and community representatives—who have contributed their statements, attended court, and recorded their observations with commendable fortitude. The careful and measured demeanour of these witnesses under cross-examination has greatly assisted the administration of justice. Their efforts, often against the backdrop of demanding low-wage employment, deserve recognition beyond mere procedural acknowledgement.  

The court also extends formal thanks to counsel on both sides: Ms Charlotte Bexley, prosecuting on behalf of the Crown, and Mr Daniel McKinnon, representing you under a Legal Aid scheme. Both have presented diligent and professional submissions, reflecting an acute understanding of the factual, legal, and social dimensions of this matter.  

Notwithstanding the detailed psychiatric and probation assessments, one must not lose sight of the practical challenges faced by community organisations engaged in crime prevention and victim support. The Birmingham Business Crime Reduction Partnership operates under constraints limiting both staff capacity and strategic reach. Its attempts to foster communication between affected retailers, the police, and local authorities exemplify effective but resource-limited civic partnership. The financial ramifications for local shops, many of which operate on razor-thin margins and with limited economies of scale, remain a pressing concern. Crime prevention budgets have been static or reduced in the last five years, compounding pressures on frontline services.  

Moreover, the broader social environment in Birmingham and similar urban centres is characterised by a complex interplay of factors: rising homelessness presenting on street corners and in parks, the revival of open substance misuse, and community responses that can vacillate between supportive and adversarial. The pervasiveness of social media platforms and their attendant cultural shifts arguably influence youth perceptions of risk and opportunity, a factor noted in social research reports commissioned by the West Midlands Police. Nevertheless, the court’s focus must remain squarely on adjudicating criminal conduct within the framework established by law and precedent.  

The Legal Aid Agency’s labyrinthine funding procedures remain a source of concern. In this case, the time taken to authorise the commissioning of psychiatric expertise reveals systemic inefficiencies that challenge the ideal of timely justice. While safeguarding mechanisms and quality assurance are important, excessive red tape risks eroding defence rights and imposes undue strain on court resources. The phenomenon of repeated funding delays is now regularly brought to judicial attention, and it is to be hoped that those tasked with oversight consider reform.  

In addition to the direct concerns of this case, the court notes with some regret the historical burden of unrelated offences in the caseload of local courts. Matters such as fly-tipping incidents in green belt land, affray arising from public houses, and isolated instances of criminal damage to religious premises have all contributed cumulatively to judicial backlog and resource depletion, although they bear no relation to the instant proceedings.  

Furthermore, co-defendants in unrelated cases often complicate scheduling and resource allocation. A recent matter involving armed robbery and restraining order breaches in neighboring Court 8 witnessed adjournments due to the non-appearance of one co-defendant who remains at large. Such occurrences, while not impacting your case directly, reflect the operational environment in which this court functions.  

It is incumbent upon the justice system to balance individual circumstances with the broader imperative of public protection and confidence. This includes an understanding of the roles played by community agencies, voluntary support organisations, and statutory services, many of whom labor under mounting pressure. Their contributions, often imperceptible to the public eye, form a vital part of the ecosystem of safety and rehabilitation.  

Having considered all written and oral submissions, the reports from forensic and clinical experts, victim impact material, and relevant case law, I now move to preliminary observations on sentencing.  

Your offending, while devoid of violence, was marked by persistence, planning, and a disregard for prior opportunities extended by the justice system and community interventions. Credit for your early guilty plea will be recognised but is tempered by the protracted period over which offences occurred. Your history of previous theft convictions and community resolutions further diminish the prospect of a wholly non-custodial sentence.  

In line with the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences, custody remains an available and appropriate sentencing option, particularly where repeated offending evidences an entrenched pattern rather than an isolated lapse. The principle of proportionality compels a sentence commensurate with seriousness, community safety, and the likelihood of effective rehabilitation. Reference to precedent indicates that, absent significant mitigating factors, immediate custody is routinely warranted where acquisitive offending is recurrent and causes cumulative harm to victims and the wider community.  

Nevertheless, the court is mindful of your reported vulnerabilities and the ongoing risk factors identified by expert assessors. Any custodial sentence will necessitate consideration of appropriate elements of supervision, intervention, and support to facilitate reduction of reoffending risk upon release.  

In this regard, the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report remains essential. The probation service is requested to examine the feasibility of a community order incorporating a mental health treatment requirement, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, and participation in accredited cognitive skills and thinking skills programmes. Furthermore, the inclusion of unpaid work, if suitable and safe to do so, should be evaluated carefully in light of your personal circumstances and community needs.  

I will therefore adjourn sentencing to permit the probation service to complete this report and, if appropriate, to allow for any additional representations from relevant agencies or victim liaison officers. Should any material late emerge relating to your conduct or personal circumstances, the court will consider it at that time.  

These sentencing remarks are made this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the
