IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/13456  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. L. HARRINGTON  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction for theft, specifically multiple counts of shoplifting, in breach of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences date from late 2023 through to early 2025 and involve a series of related incidents across retail outlets predominantly within the Brighton and Hove metropolitan area. This court must now consider the appropriate disposal with due regard to the gravity of the conduct, relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, and the overarching principles of sentencing justice.

Procedural History  
Your case commenced on 2 April 2025 when you were formally charged with four counts of theft sourced from stores within the city centre and surrounding suburbs. Initial proceedings before the Brighton Magistrates’ Court did not produce a plea, resulting in transfer to this Crown Court by virtue of the volume of evidence, the complexity of the pattern of offending, and your previous record which includes similar offences. The matter was listed for a Plea and Case Management Hearing on 23 June 2025, where you entered a not guilty plea.

It is regrettable though not uncommon that matters of this nature — often characterised by low individual monetary value but amplified by repeated theft behaviour — attract protracted procedural phases. This is due, in no small measure, to the intricate evidential collation necessary: exhibit inventories, witness statements from retail personnel who may have limited criminal procedure experience, and reviewing CCTV footage of varying quality across different venues and formats. The endeavour to ensure compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules and disclosure obligations invariably imposes burdens upon all parties.

Following several directions hearings, evidence disclosure was finalised by 10 August 2025, including a comprehensive package comprising time-stamped video, expert reports on fingerprint and DNA analysis, and victim impact statements from multiple small business owners. Meanwhile, defence counsel advanced applications to adduce a psychiatric evaluation and to disclose the defendant’s medical records, the latter being granted in part on 14 July 2025. The psychiatric report, completed by Dr Holly McKeon, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was served 3 September 2025. Multiple adjournments were necessary to accommodate these procedural requisites; the court notes the implications this has upon resource allocation and witness availability, but accepts that justice demands thorough preparation.

The Better Case Management (BCM) framework continues to govern complex prosecutions such as this one, and it is to the credit of all parties—including the prosecution, defence, and court staff—that these proceedings have largely adhered to the indicative timetable without the excessive delays so often lamented in cases of acquisitive offending. The active role of the Brighton Business Crime Reduction Partnership in coordinating intelligence and victim liaison has been essential, facilitating both investigative continuity and victim support.

It is, nonetheless, a notable example of the systemic pressures placed on public institutions. NHS mental health services in the locality report extended waiting times, with inpatient beds at capacity and community teams stretched thin. The Probation Service has likewise faced significant staffing shortages in recent months, impacting both report preparation and offender supervision capacity. These factors, while external to your case, form the unavoidable institutional context within which this court must operate. The court also acknowledges recent refurbishment of courtrooms, including improvements to audio-visual systems which have facilitated better presentation of digital evidence. The Crown Prosecution Service’s IT support team deserves commendation for their assistance in this respect.

Defence submissions during the sentencing hearing have been advanced by Mr Gregor Sinclair, whom the court thanks for detailed and conscientious advocacy. Counsel raises issues relating to your background, mental health, and mitigation inspired by hardship. These have been explored through the report of Dr McKeon and the probation assessment authored by Ms Clare Jennings. The court has given careful consideration to these materials, which are comprehensive and clinically informed. The psychiatric report notes that, although no major mental disorder has been definitively diagnosed, you do demonstrate several personality traits such as externalising behaviours, impulsivity, and intermittent substance misuse—particularly involving alcohol. Engagement with therapeutic services has been inconsistent, a factor that complicates formulation of an effective rehabilitative pathway.

In anticipation of the sentencing hearing, several letters of support were submitted by charitable organisations, including the Brighton Street Outreach Project and the local branch of Crisis Care Trust. They attest to your sporadic cooperation with welfare support, including advice on financial management and housing, though emphasising the fragile nature of your current social circumstances. The court is grateful for these contributions and recognises the vital role that such agencies play in bridging gaps left by statutory services operating at or beyond capacity.

It is a regrettable but persistent feature of the contemporary justice landscape that Legal Aid arrangements frequently impede timely access to expert input. Defence applications to instruct Dr McKeon were delayed due to procedural reviews by the Legal Aid Agency, whose correspondence was intermittently non-responsive until formal reminders were issued by legal representatives. Such delays affect not only the defendant’s interest in due process but also overall case management efficiency and public confidence. This court solemnly advises the agency to review internal processing practices to prevent recurrence.

The public interest in prosecuting persistent acquisitive crime cannot be overstated. Matters of commercial retail theft, even when involving individually low-value items, cumulatively strain not only the economic stability of small and medium enterprises but also impact local employment, customer footfall, and ancillary services. The business community has expressed through various reports and consultations their weariness at the repeated disruption caused.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

The pattern of your offending—committed over multiple premises, involving deception and concealment—is thus far from trivial or isolated. The calculated nature of the conduct, combined with the sustained course over time, significantly aggravates the culpability. 

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

It must be noted that the legal framework provided by the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences is clear in its categorisation of offending based on harm, culpability, and context. The guideline expressly recognises the aggravating impact of repeated theft targeting vulnerable or independent traders, especially where offences cause lasting disruption or distress to employees.

This court recalls the principles re-stated in the Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Greaves [2019] EWCA Crim 1234, where it was held that the cumulative effect of repeated theft may produce a harm greater than the simple aggregate of individual monetary values. Greaves illustrated that the psychological effect on victims, the undermining of business confidence, and the additional policing costs weight heavily in the sentencing calculus. Although Greaves involved offences relating predominantly to electrical components and consumables from larger retail chains, the principles articulated have equal application here.

In a distinctly separate illustrative case, R v. Stanton [2020] EWCA Crim 678, a defendant convicted of burglary involving the theft of prescription medications was sentenced to a custodial term of 18 months, reflecting both the intrinsic value and potential community risk associated with the misappropriation of such items. Stanton further underlines that where theft intersects with potential harm—whether direct or indirect—enhanced penalties may be warranted. Matthews [2021] EWCA Crim 89 expands on the relevance of public protection in sentencing decisions, emphasizing rehabilitation as a complementary, but not substitutive, consideration to deterrence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

That said, this court has also taken note of a series of cases that underscore the nuanced approach courts must adopt in balancing punishment with prospects for rehabilitation, particularly where underlying vulnerability is demonstrated. The Court of Appeal’s ruling in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, although concerned with a defendant diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder involved in arson, remains relevant for the principle that severe mental illness does not automatically negate the requirement for custody where risk to the public is tangible and significant management is required.

It is equally pertinent to consider the observations in R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412, where community-based interventions were determined insufficient in the face of escalating disregard for public safety, particularly in matters involving endangerment—albeit of a nature far removed from acquisitive theft.

Parallel to this, the court is cognisant of the challenges faced by frontline officers and public services. The increased demand on the Brighton and East Sussex Police Property Crime Unit, and the associated financial and human resource burdens described in their recent operational reviews, illustrate the wider cost to society beyond mere loss of goods.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

Nonetheless, this court is mindful that custodial sentencing carries its own costs—not only monetary but also social and rehabilitative—and must always be proportionate to the offending conduct and attendant risks. It is, therefore, incumbent upon the court to evaluate all relevant disposals, applying the 'least restrictive effective' principle.

The pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Clare Jennings has been instructive in assessing your engagement with supervision and potential interventions. It notes your history of unstable accommodation, intermittent employment, and a pattern of substance misuse, alongside a lack of sustained service contact until recent weeks. The report recommends consideration of rehabilitative programmes focusing on impulse control, financial management, and accommodation stability, tailored to your capacities and needs. Such approaches, if effectively implemented, may reduce the risk of recidivism.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Victim impact statements supplied by shop managers describe a collective sense of alarm and demoralisation. In one case, a long-serving retail assistant reported feeling “targeted and anxious,” subsequently altering her working hours to avoid lone shifts during times you were known to frequent the premises. Another victim described the financial losses as “a steady drip draining small business viability.” These testimonials demonstrate the tangible effects your conduct has imposed on individuals and businesses alike.

It must be noted, however, that there is no evidence of physical harm or threats directed at staff. Unlike cases involving violent or coercive behaviour as explored in R v. Calderwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, the present matter is characterised predominantly by dishonesty and repeated property interference rather than personal injury or intimidation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

While the absence of direct violence is a mitigating factor, the court emphasises that psychological impact—even in the absence of physical assault—cannot be discounted. A secure and respectful working environment is a fundamental right; repeated theft undermines that right and instils fear and uncertainty.

The court is also mindful of the prevalence of late or tactical pleas in cases involving acquisitive crime. The defendant entered a plea of guilty at the earliest practical stage following the exchange of disclosure and the establishment of a compelling evidential case. Such plea timing entitles Mr H to a credit in accordance with established sentencing principles, albeit tempered by the persistence and multiplicity of the offending conduct.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Legal Aid-related delays in the securing of expert evidence and reports have undoubtedly impacted the progress of this matter. The court reiterates that the effective and timely provision of defence funding is essential to the just, expeditious resolution of criminal proceedings and urges continued systemic improvements.

Separately, it is pertinent to acknowledge that the defendant’s coping strategies and social support networks appear limited. The position of Ms Sarah Bloom, a caseworker at the Brighton Housing Support Service, provides a valuable perspective on the challenges faced by individuals navigating housing instability—a demographic particularly vulnerable to lapses into acquisitive crime. The difficulties of accessing suitable accommodation and sustaining tenancy without recourse to theft for subsistence purposes pose complex social policy questions extending beyond the ambit of the court.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

The court has noted the detailed and professionally prepared probation assessment, which incorporates evaluations of your criminogenic needs, risk factors, and service engagement potential. Recommendations include participation in accredited Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) programmes designed to address criminal thinking and impulsivity, as well as supervised unpaid work to repair harm caused to the community. Consideration is also urged for enhanced substance misuse treatment, both pharmacological and psychosocial, to support behavioural change.

Before arriving at a final sentence, the court must also consider relevant statutory provisions, including sections 148 and 149 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 relating to the calculation of seriousness, and sections 174 and 177 concerning the use of community orders and custodial sentences. Sentencing aims to achieve punishment, deterrence, reparation, and rehabilitation, with public protection informing all these objectives.

This court further references the Sentencing Council’s guideline on Overarching Principles, which informs the assessment of personal mitigation and culpability, alongside guidance on the appropriate deductions for a guilty plea. In accordance with R v. Dacres [2021] EWCA Crim 1331, the timing of your admission warrants a moderate discount acknowledging your early acceptance of responsibility upon the tipping point of firm evidential establishment.

At this point, I remind the parties that the final sentencing outcome will remain reserved pending the formal receipt of an updated pre-sentence report, incorporating any recent developments and the feasibility of community-based disposals.

I thank Ms Harriet Winslow, who appears for the Crown, for her able advocacy. I also express appreciation to Mr Gregor Sinclair for his continued professional conduct on behalf of the defendant. Court staff and ushers are also acknowledged in the interest of due procedural decorum throughout the hearing.

This judgment is delivered in open court today, 14 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal the sentence imposed within 28 days under sections 108 and 109 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 respectively. There are no reporting restrictions attached to these proceedings under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.

The final sentence will be pronounced upon submission and consideration of the pre-sentence report. Additional correspondence and representations may be submitted within the prescribed time limits.

These are the orders of the court.
