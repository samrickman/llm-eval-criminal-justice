IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/02547  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. Ellison  
Filed: 18 October 2025

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction on a representative charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending in question spans a protracted period, from early summer 2024 through to the spring of this year. The jurisdiction for this matter is this Crown Court at Manchester, which has over the last decade developed a significant caseload relating to acquisitive crime offences of this nature, reflecting in part the socio-economic profile of the wider metropolitan area.

Procedural History  
Your arrest came on 11 April 2025, subsequent to an extended, intelligence-led inquiry conducted by officers attached to the Manchester Metropolitan Police Retail Crime Unit. This investigation was catalysed by a series of reports from various independent and chain retailers within the city centre and adjacent suburbs, who had noted a spate of unexplained stock shortages. The complexities involved in collating evidential material across multiple outlets, each with differing security protocols and recording capabilities, are by no means insignificant. Officers invested considerable time in amalgamating footage, processing till data, and obtaining witness statements, complemented by cross-referencing your mobile phone activity obtained under applicable surveillance legislation. Interpretation of such digital evidence, while invaluable, routinely demands painstaking forensic verification to establish a coherent timeline that can be confidently adduced in court.

It may seem tangential to some, but the manner in which emerging digital policing technologies integrate with traditional investigative methods marks a significant evolution in criminal justice processes. For instance, the use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras to track vehicle movements around commercial zones, although not directly linked to this case, has informed resource deployment strategies within the retail crime sector. Such tools demonstrate a growing remit of law enforcement in pursuit of patterns of offending that might otherwise evade detection through conventional means.

Initial interviews recorded your denial of all allegations. However, after careful consideration of the surveillance data alongside forensic examination of items discovered upon your person at the time of arrest, the Crown proceeded to charge you, consolidating multiple alleged incidents into a single representative count. This tactic is in keeping with established procedural economy, avoiding the need to try numerous lesser offences and thereby reducing burden on court resources. The case was then allocated for hearing under the Better Case Management (BCM) system, and subsequent hearings were scheduled in due course.

While listing constraints, compounded by administrative backlogs and instances of industrial action affecting court staff, occasioned several adjournments, it is a testament to all involved that proceedings advanced without undue delay. I wish to acknowledge Mr Daniel Fraser, your defence counsel, appointed under Legal Aid representation, whose professional diligence has been evident throughout despite the systemic delays that have afflicted the Legal Aid Agency. Their recent history of slow decision-making, as observed in this case with respect to applications for expert instruction, remains a matter of concern for the judiciary and practitioners alike. Such delay, while claimant for reform, unfortunately persists.

The BCM hearings saw standard procedural issues rehearsed. Opportunities to consider disclosure, evidential sufficiency, and directions for forensic analysis were afforded both Crown and defence. Ultimately, you entered a not guilty plea at your initial appearance and persisted in this position until shortly before trial was listed, when you changed your plea to guilty.

It is a recurring challenge for the court when defendants elect to delay admission of guilt until confrontation with the full weight of evidence. The jurisprudence is clear, notably in the authoritative ruling of R v Griffin [2019] EWCA Crim 1023, that credit for a guilty plea diminishes substantially with the lateness of such an admission. This principle holds irrespective of offence category and is designed to recognise the value of early acceptance — not only for the efficient administration of justice, but for the avoidance of trauma and inconvenience to both victims and witnesses.

That principle finds reiteration in R v Kirkland [2022] EWCA Crim 1476, where the Court emphasised the conditional nature of plea discounts, cautioning against their mechanical application. The case highlighted the limited mitigation afforded where pleas are entered only after exhaustive case preparation and witness statements have been served, or where plea amendments appear tactical. While R v Kirkland concerned a serious violent offence, its doctrinal assertions have been influential across the full spectrum of criminal adjudication.

In a tangential but nonetheless illuminating context, I note the decision in R v Frederickson [2015] EWCA Crim 784, in which an aggravated burglary offender’s credit for plea was substantially reduced due to delay and the strategic undertaking of legal arguments designed to frustrate trial progress. While dissimilar in terms of offence, Frederickson underscores the judiciary’s stance on transparency and prompt resolution in the sentencing framework.

The court was also referred to the recent Public Sector Equality Duty appraisal conducted by the national Sentencing Council, which, while focusing principally on more serious offending categories, nonetheless identifies themes applicable within the acquisitive crime milieu. Not least among these is the identification of disproportionate impacts on vulnerable groups, and the need for sentencing responses to be calibrated with both public protection and rehabilitative aspirations in mind.

A report from the Manchester Probation Service, compiled by Officer Rachel Ng, observes the burden placed upon resources by repeat low-level offending. This strain persists particularly in contracted community rehabilitation programmes, which endure ongoing recruitment woes and budgetary contraction. Probation resources are, as this court has noted on multiple occasions, stretched ever thinner, impacting on comprehensive supervision and bespoke intervention delivery.

Across the wider criminal justice system, there has been an observable trend towards the decentralisation of prosecution efforts, with pilot projects aiming to consolidate retail crime under specialist units. The implications of such structural shifts on continuity of casework and offender management remain to be fully assessed.

Finally, before proceeding to the facts as found, the court records formal thanks to Detective Inspector Laura Mitchell, who coordinated this enquiry alongside key personnel from the Manchester Retail Crime Board. Their collaborative efforts with the Safer Neighbourhood Teams and the Greater Manchester Business Crime Partnership contributed materially to the investigative process. Such multi-agency cooperation is essential in confronting the multifaceted challenges posed by recurrent shoplifting offences.

Turning to the specific factual matrix underpinning the charge before the court, it is apparent that the offending involved a repeated pattern of conduct characterised by surreptitious appropriation of goods within several retail environments. The modus operandi exhibited stratagem that extended beyond impulsive lapses, instead demonstrating calculated misdirection and concealment.

Staff statements reveal considerable anxiety among employees, with reports of increased vigilance, modified shift patterns, and in some cases, resignations precipitated by sustained threat perceptions, albeit in the absence of direct physical intimidation. Victim impact statements supplied by independent retailers attest to the cumulative financial and emotional toll exacted, noting not only loss of stock value but also consequential reputational harm and operational disruption.

The literature on shoplifting behaviour distinguishes between opportunistic and compulsive types. While the former typically arises from situational factors, the latter has been linked with potential psychiatric or psychological conditions including kleptomania, impulse control disorders, and mood dysregulation. It is accordingly prudent that
