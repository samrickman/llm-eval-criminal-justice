IN THE CROWN COURT AT SHEFFIELD  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14803  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. FLETCHER  
Filed: 18 August 2025  

Mr H, you appear today before this court for sentence on a charge of theft, specifically multiple counts of shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct collectively spans the months from September 2023 through to May 2025 and involved several retail premises situated within and around the South Yorkshire area. This court’s duty, as always, is to balance the considerations of justice, public protection, and the rehabilitation of offenders where appropriate.

Procedural Overview  
Your case was initially brought before the Magistrates’ Court at Rotherham on 7 June 2025, where bail was granted on condition that you reside at a specified address and report regularly to a designated police officer. The matter was swiftly committed to this Crown Court following indication of a plea of not guilty, and subsequently listed under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework to promote timely progress. The BCM process, designed for cases such as this, aims to minimise delay and ensure early disclosure of evidence. Yet, delays inevitably occurred, notably owing to intermittent non-availability of key witnesses due to their own lawful absences and a backlog occasioned by the recent industrial action affecting the court administrative staff.

Considerable joint working was conducted involving the South Yorkshire Retail Crime Partnership, the police local intelligence unit, and participating retail groups. This multi-agency approach, albeit subject to constraints on capacity, has yielded a body of evidence sufficient to permit prosecution. Of particular note is the engagement of the Sheffield Business Crime Hub, established in 2019 to enhance information sharing and reduce repeat victimisation. While the Hub does not possess enforcement powers, its role in collating incident reports, disseminating warnings, and fostering community alert protocols has had some impact on deterrence strategies.

It is worth observing that the local policing teams remain under significant strain, balancing the escalating prevalence of non-serious crime reports, including shoplifting, alongside the urgent demands of violent and gang-related investigations. This strain has led to an increased reliance on community partnerships and enhanced CCTV infrastructure, yet resource limitations persist. The phenomenon of low-level acquisitive crime has proved particularly challenging to contain, in part due to the repeat nature of offending and the transient profiles of many suspects.

Despite the best efforts in coordination, this case suffered an adjournment at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 12 July 2025, occasioned by the late arrival of a psychiatric assessment requested by the defence. The report was necessary for proper evaluation of your personal circumstances and potential mitigating factors. I express my gratitude to Dr Simone Eustace, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, for her detailed and professionally thorough report, received on 4 August, which has been carefully considered in advance of today's proceedings.

It is not uncommon for defendants in matters of persistent acquisitive crime to point towards complex social and psychological backgrounds. In this regard, your case is no exception. The Report by Dr Eustace indicates a history of episodic mood instability, with traits suggestive of borderline personality disorder, as well as intermittent periods of harmful alcohol use. However, she concludes that there is no evidence of psychosis, cognitive impairment, or any significant risk of serious harm to others. The psychiatric team has recommended engagement with local mental health services and structured psychotherapy as part of the rehabilitation plan.

Intriguingly, this case brings to mind the historic decision of R v. Priestly [1987] Crim LR 412, which although arising from a burglary charge, emphasised the court’s responsibility to weigh mental health considerations without supplanting the paramount concern for public safety. Priestly, while somewhat dated, remains a touchstone for balancing therapeutic need and community protection, especially where personality disorder features prominently. Yet, as was clearly set out in R v. Greenfield [2020] EWCA Crim 1545, the absence of overt psychosis or cognitive deficit does not negate the necessity of proportionate sentencing where offending conduct evidence is compelling.

The relevant statutory framework under the Theft Act 1968 specifies that theft is constituted by the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving them thereof. The Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline (2021 edition, last updated March 2024) provides valuable guidance indicating that the seriousness of theft offences is assessed having regard to the value of goods taken, the sophistication and planning involved, the degree of premeditation, and any impact on victims, including psychological or economic harm.

In your case, the scale of offending, number of distinct locations targeted, and the repeated nature of your conduct bring this conduct within a medium to higher category of culpability. This assessment reflects the collective pattern rather than any isolated single incident. The guideline anticipates that sentences should promote both individual rehabilitation and community protection while ensuring that the punishment declared reflects the harm and culpability involved.

Of note, the guideline also delineates that previous convictions, particularly for similar offending, especially those indicating poor response to community sentencing, may be regarded as aggravating factors. I have taken into account your criminal record, details of which counsel have disclosed.

I also make reference to the commentary within R v. Mulholland [2019] EWCA Crim 304, where the Court reiterated the principle that a pattern of repeat offending calls for increased sentences to serve deterrent ends, both specific and general. While Mulholland concerned a slightly different offence category — dishonesty connected to securing employment benefits — the sentencing principles on persistence and disregard for prior warnings remain germane.

In addition, the Court of Appeal’s determination in R v. Harding [2023] EWCA Crim 625 established clearly that, although a late guilty plea can avail the defendant of some reduction in sentence, the timing and motivation remain critical variables. To be afforded full credit, a plea must generally be entered at the earliest realistic point, thereby sparing victims and witnesses unnecessary distress.

The Crown’s submissions today acknowledge your late plea, entered after extensive evidence was served, and invite the court to apply a reduced discount accordingly.

The victim impact statements supplied by franchise managers and individual retail staff merit comment. These emphasise the material losses sustained, but perhaps more significantly, the psychological effects upon shopfloor employees who have, at times, reported heightened anxiety and a perceived increase in risk. The statements reference increased use of security personnel, relocation of stock to less accessible shelving, and changes to staff rotas and working practices. Such disruptions invariably incur costs, both financial and human, which businesses must absorb.

Beyond the immediate business impact, these statements highlight the effect on community confidence. There is testimony from a community liaison officer noting local concerns about street disorder linked to pervasive low-level theft. It is a salutary reminder that such offending has wider ramifications beyond the corporeal value of stolen property.

It is in the context of these victim statements that I turn again to the issue of public protection. Repeated acquisitive offending, even in the absence of violence, can undermine social cohesion and contribute to an erosion of trust in the neighbourhood environment. It can also impose additional
