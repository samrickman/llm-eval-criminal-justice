IN THE CROWN COURT AT EASTBOURNE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/15739  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. J. Eldridge  
Filed: 19 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear today before this court to be sentenced for a representative count of theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The indictment relates to a course of conduct involving repeated shoplifting offences over a period extending from mid-2023 to early 2025, committed at multiple retail premises within the boroughs of Eastbourne and Hastings.

Procedural History  
The matter came before the Crown Court following your arrest on 17 March 2025. Your detention followed a lengthy multi-agency investigation coordinated by the Eastbourne Borough Police Retail Crime Unit alongside local business security teams and the Sussex Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP). The partnership had collated detailed incident reports, customer complaints, and undercover operations data over more than 18 months. They sought to identify patterns of repeat offending that had a disproportionately detrimental effect on independent and small-chain retailers within the seaside commercial zones.

Such investigations into low-level but persistent retail theft demand significant allocation of limited policing resources. Officers tasked with these cases, who might otherwise address violence or organised crime, are frequently engaged over extended periods with detailed evidence gathering; this includes obtaining and reviewing hours of CCTV footage, interviewing store staff and witnesses, and cross-jurisdictional information sharing. The burden on police and retail partners reflects not only the material loss but also the intangible costs borne by employees and communities.

As is well documented, an area which suffers repeated instances of retail theft commonly reports increased staff anxiety, high absenteeism, and a diminished sense of safety that may precipitate reduced service hours or closure. It is to the credit of the BCRP that they managed to sustain engagement with both law enforcement and retailers throughout the protracted investigative phase, despite significant challenges including staff turnovers and stretched operational capacity.

Your arrest was the culmination of covert surveillance and an intelligence-led operation that included authorised mobile phone data extraction approved by the Senior Investigating Officer and an independent judicial authorising magistrate under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The resultant evidence, including multiple CCTV captures and witness statements, presented a compelling case which led to your formal charge. 

Following your initial custody and interviews under Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 protocols, you were charged with eight counts of theft and subsequently arraigned in the Magistrates’ Court on 21 March 2025. Because of the perceived complexity and volume of evidence, the matter was committed to the Crown Court for trial or plea. The case was listed under the Better Case Management (BCM) pilot initiative aimed at expediting the preparation and hearing of cases with comprehensive evidence sets.

No less than four pre-trial hearings were convened between April and September 2025, each scheduled in consultation with the parties to ensure compliance with disclosure obligations and to permit the exchange of defence materials, including expert reports. The Legal Aid Agency’s administration in this case was, regrettably, marked by repeated delays, particularly concerning applications for funding to commission forensic psychiatric analysis and cognitive assessment. This situation is unfortunately emblematic of the systemic challenges faced by practitioners in securing timely authorisation for expert involvement, as has been noted in recent Parliamentary Select Committee enquires on legal aid funding efficiency.

Your defence attorney, Mr Jonathan Blythe, instructed under a Legal Aid scheme, made laudable efforts to mitigate these bureaucratic impediments, resulting in a late but comprehensive psychiatric report being submitted on 30 September 2025. I acknowledge Mr Blythe’s continuing professionalism under these conditions. Ms Sylvia Arden appeared for the Crown Prosecution Service and advanced an unambiguous case against you.

The matter was first listed for plea and trial preparation on 12 June 2025. At that hearing, you entered a not guilty plea, with the case being adjourned to allow for further evidential disclosure and expert reporting. However, on 15 September 2025, shortly before the trial window was due to open, you altered your plea to guilty on the single representative count.

It is a regrettable yet familiar pattern that defendants in persistent acquisitive crime cases often maintain denial until the weight of evidence, including forensic corroboration and multiple witness statements, makes contest untenable. The courts recognise the conventional discount for early guilty pleas as an incentive for early admission of responsibility, which may spare victims and witnesses from the rigours of trial. However, where pleas are delayed until near trial, the discount must appropriately reflect the timing and motivation rather than be viewed as an unavoidable right. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly emphasised this principle: see R v. Benfield [2024] EWCA Crim 1543 and R v. Silverton [2023] EWCA Crim 2101.

A comprehensive review of sentencing authorities underscores the judiciary’s imperative to hold the balance between rehabilitation on the one hand, and deterrence and public protection on the other. In R v. Fletcher [2022] EWCA Crim 889, the Court of Appeal upheld the imposition of an immediate custodial sentence where persistent dishonesty was accompanied by a manifest lack of remorse or engagement with rehabilitative services. Conversely, R v. Kirkland [2023] EWCA Crim 801 reiterated the necessity of proportionate sentencing reflective of the offender’s social and psychological circumstances.

There is, of course, an expanding corpus of jurisprudence addressing the intersection between mental health, addiction, and risk assessment in offences of this nature. In R v. Matthews [2019] EWCA Crim 1156, the court elucidated that while underlying vulnerabilities may inform sentencing disposition, they do not detract from accountability where the risk of reoffending remains high and community safety cannot be assured. More recently, in R v. Harper [2024] EWCA Crim 330, the engagement failure with community psychiatric resources weighed heavily against the appellant’s plea for leniency.

It is important to reflect on the operational context in which offences such as those under consideration occur. Retail theft, though often minimised or dismissed as trivial, imposes a ripple effect that reaches well beyond the immediate loss of goods. Local shops frequently operate on tight margins, and persistent theft undermines their viability, sometimes precipitating closures that erode the social fabric of high streets and community cohesion. Clerks and assistants bear the brunt of confronting offenders, absorbing not only financial but also emotional strain.

The Safer Eastbourne Partnership, a multi-agency initiative tasked with reducing acquisitive crime, submitted a detailed community impact statement. This report draws attention to the deleterious effects of recurrent shoplifting on staff morale, with some employees requesting transfers or resigning due to stress and fear. It notes, pertinently, that while offences are low-value individually, their cumulative effect is significantly disruptive.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

The Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline (2024) remains the authoritative framework guiding judicial approach. The guideline categorises theft in bands reflecting harm and culpability, acknowledging factors including victim vulnerability, use of deception, breach of trust, planning, and sophistication of offending. The repeated nature of conduct and its economic and psychological impact weighs heavily towards the upper range of seriousness.

Additionally, it is appropriate to consider the Sentencing Council’s Overarching Principles Guideline, updated last in 2023, which directs courts to impose sentences commensurate with public protection while encouraging intervention where suitable. Rehabilitation and reduction of reoffending underpin many community orders, but only when the offending pattern and defendant’s circumstances allow.

It would be remiss to overlook the noteworthy developments in court administration pertinent to this matter. Eastbourne Crown Court has recently concluded a major refurbishment of its courtroom audio-visual facilities, facilitating improved access to video evidence and digital exhibits. While peripheral to substantive justice, such enhancements serve the delivery of fair and expedient trials. 

In the current pandemic-impacted climate, courts have contended with fluctuating operational constraints, staffing shortages, and sporadic adjournments, including a brief suspension following a staff Covid outbreak in Court 1 during early 2025. These external factors notwithstanding, the parties are commended for adherence, as far as possible, to scheduled listings.

Your case was delayed in part due to the unavailability of an appropriate forensic psychiatric expert, a predicament linked to the limited number of qualified consultants willing to accept publicly funded instructions. This scarcity impairs timely justice and burdens the system, a problem regularly raised by the Criminal Bar Association and echoed in recent Ministry of Justice consultations.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Consideration was also given to an application for ancillary matters involving the examination of co-defendant behaviour in an unrelated matter. I note that a former flatmate of yours was subject to separate proceedings involving possession of a bladed item on school premises, the subject of R v. Langford [2022] EWCA Crim 1349. That offence bears no connection to your conduct and must be disregarded in assessing your culpability.

Similarly, references in the case file to a prior landlord noise abatement notice served upon your accommodation’s owner in 2023 are extrinsic and irrelevant to the Court’s deliberations. No evidence suggests this impacted upon your offending.

Notwithstanding the apparent complexity of the criminal justice process, this case stands as a demonstration that cooperative work between agencies—police, courts, legal representatives, and community groups—can yield cohesive procedural outcomes with integrity.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

As part of the pre-sentence assessment, a report was prepared by the probation service, addressing your background, previous offending, social circumstances, and risk of reoffending. The report speaks to a history of unstable accommodation, marked periods of unemployment, substance misuse including intermittent dependency on alcohol, and intermittent engagement with voluntary support services. However, the report identifies significant gaps in your receptivity to sustained intervention, noting missed appointments and periods of lost contact.

The report further references the “Thinking Skills Programme” and “Enhanced Thinking Skills” initiatives, which have been introduced nationally as cognitive behavioural interventions targeting reasoning deficits implicated in patterns of acquisitive offending. While potentially beneficial, your current levels of engagement suggest cautious optimism at best.

The psychiatric evaluation conducted by Dr Marian Telford, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, while noting no major psychiatric illness, identifies features consistent with an impulsive personality disorder and low mood exacerbated by social isolation. While no formal diagnosis of major depressive disorder was made, Dr Telford observed that instability of housing and lack of family support contribute to ongoing vulnerability.

Despite recommendations for social work support and engagement with local alcohol support charities, your record suggests ambivalence, limiting the practical effect of such clinical advice.

The probation service also highlights that no evidence was found of involvement in organised crime, coercion, or human trafficking, and that no child safeguarding concerns have been raised in relation to your household.

I acknowledge the letter submitted on your behalf from a local charity, The Brighton and East Sussex Homeless Outreach Trust, which underlines the precariousness of your current living arrangement. The letter, while supportive, cautions that the ongoing risk of eviction and extreme weather exposure pose an urgent housing challenge. The impact of this instability on mental health and behaviour is recognised, notwithstanding the Court’s expectation of personal responsibility.

In line with longstanding precedents, it remains essential that sentencing targets both the needs of the individual offender and the broader imperative of public protection. Rehabilitation-focused sentences retain their place; however, community measures must be effectively tailored and credible in terms of prospect of compliance.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

It is essential to record a brief reflection on the broader climate within which courts like this operate. The significant pressures levied upon public services—including probation, mental health, and social care—have escalated markedly in recent years. Increasing caseloads and reductions in resource allocation challenge the capacity of front-line workers to maintain consistent engagement and deliver bespoke interventions.

In this vein, I must commend the efforts of the local probation team who, despite these constraints, have committed substantial time to preparing thorough reports and supervision plans for this court. Similarly, thanks are due to the staff of the Sussex Business Crime Reduction Partnership, whose victim liaison work exemplifies professionalism and care in circumstances where collective resolve is often tested.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

Turning to ancillary jurisprudence relevant to sentencing duration, although your offences bear no connection to matters involving arson, the Court of Appeal decisions in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624 and R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412 provide instructive contrasts in addressing sentences for calculated and escalating criminal behaviour marked by public risk.

In both cases, custodial sentences were affirmed where the scale and degree of harm warranted restriction of liberty for a significant term. While these cases do not map directly onto your conduct, they emphasise the principle that judicial discretion must always account for the protective function of sentencing alongside rehabilitation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

In concluding, I remind you of the well-established parameters within which the judiciary operates. Sentencing is not conducted in isolation from the societal context but is fundamentally an exercise in balancing the competing objectives of retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection.

Summary  
The facts as admitted disclose a persistent and deliberate pattern of shoplifting over an extended timeframe, marked by planning and disregard for lawful boundaries. The impact upon victims—small retailers and employees alike—has been palpably adverse. Your personal circumstances afford some mitigation, but your lack of meaningful engagement with available support services weighs against a wholly lenient approach.

A plea of guilty, while welcome, was tendered at an unusually late stage; thus, the credit for that plea will be calibrated accordingly in sentencing.

I shall therefore direct that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared by the National Probation Service. The report is to examine in detail the suitability of community orders incorporating rehabilitative programmes such as cognitive skills training and supervision aligned with mitigating your offending triggers. It shall also consider accommodation stability, substance use treatment engagement, and potential restorative justice interventions.

While the possibility of custodial sentence cannot be excluded in light of the pattern and persistence of offending, the Court remains open to options that advance both your rehabilitation and the protection of the community.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 19 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Eastbourne. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be conveyed to the appropriate authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. No order as to costs is made at this stage.

These are the orders of the court.
