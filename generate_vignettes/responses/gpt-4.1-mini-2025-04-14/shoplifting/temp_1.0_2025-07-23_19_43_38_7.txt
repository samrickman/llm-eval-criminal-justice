IN THE CROWN COURT AT BELFORD  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13482  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. Grantham  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear today for sentence following your conviction on a single representative count of theft, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, concerning shoplifting offences committed over a sustained period across various retail outlets within the boroughs of Belford and Craydon from mid-2023 through early 2025. The charge before the court is indicative of a broader course of conduct characterised by repeated unlawful appropriations of goods, typically low-value but cumulatively significant in both economic and social terms.

Procedural history is of some relevance here. You were originally arrested on 12 February 2025 after an intelligence-led operation coordinated by teams from the Belford Borough Police Retail Crime Unit, acting in liaison with the Belford Business Crime Reduction Partnership. The investigatory phase included the collection and analysis of digital surveillance footage from multiple premises and a review of store-level incident logs, alongside witness statements supplied by store security personnel and local shopkeepers. This was far from a routine matter; the investigation relied on a multi-agency tasking arrangement that included officers seconded from neighbourhood policing teams and support from specialist CCTV analysts. Funding limitations and resource constraints meant such investigations necessarily demand careful prioritisation. The case progressed via the Crown Court’s Better Case Management pathway, with hearings listed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules procedural timing targets.

At the first hearing on 3 March 2025, you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequent evidential elaboration, however, led to a majority of material being admitted by consent. After the provision of further disclosure and the collation of additional witness statements, you altered your plea to guilty at the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing held on 10 July 2025. As this court has emphasised on many occasions, the timing of a guilty plea materially affects the credit awarded. The well-established principles reiterated in R v. Carmichael [2021] EWCA Crim 1875 remain instructive: early pleas contribute to the conservation of scarce judicial and witness resources and demonstrate genuine remorse. Late pleas, particularly those tendered at or near trial, frequently reflect strategic considerations rather than immediate acceptance of culpability, and attract correspondingly reduced credit.

It is to be noted that these proceedings encountered a measure of delay, in part attributable to the withdrawal of initial legal representatives due to conflicts of interest, and subsequent adjournments necessitated by the late receipt and authorisation of legal aid funding for expert reports. Delays of this kind impose frustrations on all parties, including victims, who await the resolution of matters that impact their sense of security and wellbeing. The court has reiterated its concerns regarding the performance of the Legal Aid Agency in processing applications for funding, which in this jurisdiction have exhibited unacceptable lag times. These systemic issues, while not the fault of individuals, impose additional burdens on court timetabling and risk impairing timely access to justice.

Before turning to the substance of your offending and its wider implications, it is appropriate to remark briefly on the wider social context. The east Belford district, like many urban centres, has experienced a notable escalation in reports of acquisitive crime in recent years. The joint efforts of the local policing units, retail businesses, and voluntary agencies—such as the Belford Community Support Network and ShopSafe—reflect an augmented awareness of the cumulative effects that even low-level theft can exert on community cohesion. It is regrettable, but unsurprising, that the slow attrition of public confidence correlates with incremental instances of persistent shoplifting and the associated distress it inflicts on retail staff and local proprietors. This court receives periodic updates from these partnerships, who strive diligently to shield businesses and customers alike, despite staffing pressures and the frequent attrition of experienced officers diverted to more pressing threats such as organised crime and violent offences.

The often overlooked administrative burden of these cases is substantial. Investigative files have grown in size and complexity as digital evidence multiplies, necessitating greater coordination between retail managers, law enforcement, and the Crown Prosecution Service. The efficacy of inter-agency collaboration remains inconsistent, hampered in part by insufficient cross-sector training and resource allocation. Yet, it is to their credit that the current investigation did proceed to conviction without the usual pitfalls of protracted evidence gathering or procedural irregularity.

The court takes this opportunity to thank counsel for their diligent preparation and able submissions. I record, accordingly, my gratitude to Ms Jocelyn Pritchard, instructed on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr Timothy Wade, representing your interests under a Legal Aid representation order. Both counsel conducted themselves professionally despite the constraints inherent in this kind of work.

Turning to legal context, it is necessary to remind all concerned that the Theft Act 1968 remains the cornerstone of acquisitive offence legislation in this jurisdiction. Section 1 defines theft precisely as “dishonestly appropriating property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive the other of it.” The operative elements—dishonesty, appropriation, ownership, and intent—must each be proved to the requisite criminal standard.

The Sentencing Council's guidelines for theft offences 2023 provide the framework within which this court assesses culpability and harm. Given your antecedent record, which includes three prior theft-related convictions and one community resolution, the court approaches your case with an appreciation of elevated culpability. The persistent nature of your offending and its ongoing disruption to local businesses place this matter beyond the range of a simple community disposal.

It is salutary to observe jurisprudential developments such as R v. Douglas [2024] EWCA Crim 55, where the Court of Appeal expounded upon the necessity of proportionality in sentencing repeat acquisitive offenders. While the offences in Douglas arose from a series of supermarket thefts involving concealment of high-value foodstuffs, the principles articulated therein are applicable by analogy: culpability levels rise in lockstep with offender persistence, sophistication, and disregard for earlier warnings or interventions.

I also note the decision in R v. Mansfield [2023] EWCA Crim 789, which concerned the theft by deception of bulk quantities of electronic goods. There, a custodial sentence was upheld, reflecting the clear societal harm occasioned by calculated, high-volume offending. Whilst your offending does not involve such magnitude or complexity, Mansfield’s emphasis on the wider public impact merits mention.

Finally, in R v. Iqbal [2020] EWCA Crim 1503, the court addressed the principle that even offences seemingly minor in financial scale can warrant significant deterrent sentences where there is evidence of vulnerability or victim distress. There are parallels here in the victim impact evidence adduced relating to your conduct.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

Your conduct showed a degree of planning and selectivity inconsistent with mere opportunism. CCTV footage captured you entering stores with bags designed to obscure goods, as well as making repeated returns to the same premises despite warnings. On occasion, you adopted tactics such as switching clothing layers or timing your movements to coincide with staff shift changes.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

It is important also to note that the offences targeted premises serving vulnerable populations. One pharmacy reported that your thefts included items of medication, prompting a review of security protocols and the imposition of restrictions on certain sales. This has clear public interest implications in terms of safeguarding.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Further complicating your profile, submissions before the court referenced a non-engagement with offered drug and alcohol misuse support services. Social services and substance misuse teams have repeatedly attempted to engage with you without success. This will feature in the risk and mitigation assessment I shall direct.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

Victim impact statements from retail employees describe an atmosphere of apprehension and diminished morale occasioned by your conduct. Staff have reported altered shift patterns and increased absenteeism. While there was no physical violence, the psychological toll is non-trivial.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Alongside prosecutorial evidence, the defence has submitted character references, including letters from a local shelter charity, which await fuller consideration in the forthcoming pre-sentence report. Notably, a statement from Ms Hannah Thompson, volunteer coordinator at the Belford Homeless Outreach Programme, indicates your sporadic engagement with afternoon drop-in sessions—and expresses hope for continued involvement.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

The psychiatric report prepared by Dr. Fiona Bendall, Consultant Psychiatrist at Belford Mental Health Trust, furnishes a detailed clinical appraisal. Dr Bendall identifies no major psychiatric disorder, but notes traits suggestive of impulsivity, intermittent compliance with medication regimes, and a history of untreated depression. Her conclusion supports the view that tailored, community-based interventions may be beneficial.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

The probation service has provided an initial oral risk assessment indicating moderate risk of reoffending, with an elevated risk of harm insofar as the persistence of acquisitive behaviours might exacerbate community distress. They recommend a full pre-sentence report to elaborate on these findings.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

It is perhaps worth pausing to reflect on the extraneous matter of the co-defendant in an unrelated case, who failed to attend court following an alleged affray involving pool cues at the Belford Working Men’s Club. That matter, though superficially resonant in temporal terms, holds no bearing upon your offending or risk profile. Nor is there any link to the noise abatement order recently issued against the landlord of your residence in Highfield Road, a separate administrative nuisance case involving neighbour disputes.

Similarly, there is no connection to the 2024 arson attack that partially engulfed a commercial premises near Belford Market, for which Mr Samuel Grant received a six-year custodial sentence on aggravated arson charges. That case was heard in a different court and involved an entirely distinct set of facts and defendants.

This court also records the long-standing pressures facing both the NHS and local authority social care services in Belford. Current waiting times for adult mental health services exceed national targets by several weeks, an issue lamented in recent parliamentary inquiries. Such systemic strains impede timely clinical intervention but, crucially, do not relieve defendants of accountability.

Similarly, it is problematic that the Legal Aid Agency continues to endure critical reviews for its protracted and inconsistent handling of expert funding applications. In this matter, the authorised instructing of Dr Bendall was granted only after considerable and protracted correspondence spanning no fewer than six weeks.

The court notes the reference to the delayed arrival of qualified court interpreters at the case management hearing of 28 April 2025, a matter that caused significant extension to proceedings on that day but which did not prejudice overall case progression or access to justice.

In sum, the offending before this court cannot be regarded as trivial. Nor is it an isolated lapse. It is a sustained, deliberate course of conduct which has had tangible consequences for victims, businesses, and wider community confidence. At the same time, there is an evident need to address underlying behavioural and health-related challenges to reduce future risk.

Sentencing guidelines indicate a range of available disposals, including community orders requiring attendance at accredited offending behaviour programmes, financial penalties scaled to means and culpability, and custodial sentences where threshold criteria are met. The presence of previous convictions of a similar nature, combined with your failure to desist despite warnings and earlier interventions, weigh in favour of a sentence involving significant, structured supervision.

At this stage, I shall direct the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report. This report is to consider all relevant factors, including your personal circumstances, the risk of reoffending, and the appropriateness of rehabilitation-focused interventions. The probation officer conducting the report is also requested to explore whether a curfew or electronic monitoring condition might feasibly support compliance, and to assess the potential for engagement with local substance misuse services.

Prior to sentencing, this court will expect full evidence as to your current accommodation status and any measures that might mitigate the risk of further offending. Further, evidence should be obtained on any engagement with mental health services following Dr Bendall's report.

These sentencing remarks are issued this 18th day of September 2025 in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Belford. The formal transcript has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules and retained within the official court record. You are reminded of your right to appeal this sentence within 28 days, pursuant to sections 108 and 109 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 respectively. No reporting restrictions are engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
