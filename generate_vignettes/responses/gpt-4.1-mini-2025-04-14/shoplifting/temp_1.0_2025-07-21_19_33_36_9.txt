IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEICESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. L2025/18429  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. J. Fenwick  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following conviction for offences of theft by shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans a period of approximately 18 months from March 2024 to the early spring of 2025 and comprises a series of incidents predominantly occurring within the retail precincts of Leicester City Centre, with particular focus on several independent and smaller traders in the Highcross district and surrounding areas.  

Procedural History and Case Management  
Your initial charge was brought on 4 April 2025 following investigation by the Leicester City Retail Police Unit. This investigation involved collaboration with the Leicester Business Crime Partnership and included liaison with local CCTV control rooms, private security teams, and several affected small business proprietors. The early stage of inquiry was protracted owing to the nature of the offending—low-value, frequent, and dispersed—with evidence initially circumstantial and heavily reliant on video footage which was itself subject to scrutiny for chain-of-custody compliance. The matter was allocated for hearing in this Crown Court, falling under the category of cases warranting trial by judge and jury due to the multiplicity of incidents and the considerations arising from your prior convictions for similar offences. The transfer from the magistrates’ court was effected pursuant to protocols governing cases requiring enhanced case management intervention.  

The Better Case Management (BCM) regime was actively engaged. Your first appearance was recorded on 11 May 2025, during which you were represented by counsel instructed under a Legal Aid certificate. At that stage, a not guilty plea was entered, requiring the listing of a pre-trial review and trial preparation hearing. The progression of the matter encountered delays, not uncommon in cases of this nature, including a contested application for disclosure of additional CCTV footage and late provision of victim personal statements from several retail staff impacted by your actions. Notably, a provisional forensic evaluation of clothing seized during your arrest took longer than anticipated due to backlog in evidence processing at the central forensic laboratory serving the East Midlands region.  

The matter came before the court on 22 July 2025 for the plea and trial preparation hearing. At that hearing, after consultation with your solicitors and upon learning of the strength of the prosecution evidence — including digitised transaction records, witness statements, and pattern analysis from the Retail Crime Partnership’s data analytics unit — you tendered a plea of guilty. The court notes with some concern the delay between charge and admission, which, while not unusual, does influence the degree of credit to be applied in sentencing calculations.  

The delay in proceedings cannot be viewed in isolation. It must be set against a backdrop of systemic pressures affecting the court system generally. Rising demand for hearings, frequent strike action impacting judicial and administrative staffing, and the necessary reallocation of resources owing to national security priorities have combined to extend waiting times for many cases. Against that context, it is both regrettable and unsurprising that further adjournments were encountered during July and early August, the most significant of which were necessitated by your legal team’s application to instruct a forensic psychiatrist with niche expertise in compulsive acquisitive disorders. The Legal Aid Agency’s administrative process in approving this application was prolonged, only receiving final authorisation in mid-August following several rounds of correspondence and clarification.  

The court acknowledges the assistance provided by Dr Vanessa Llewellyn, consultant psychiatrist, whose detailed report was submitted with the permission of the parties. Dr Llewellyn’s findings, as well as the presentence report prepared by Mr David Ellington of the Leicester Probation Service, will be considered in full at the point of sentence. It is appropriate at this juncture to convey gratitude to the Probation Service, notwithstanding acknowledged staffing shortages and high caseload volumes, for their thorough preparation and measured recommendations. Pre-sentence reports in cases of acquisitive offending have increasingly incorporated trauma-informed assessment tools and risk mitigation strategies, reflecting the evolving focus on underlying drivers of persistent theft behaviour, and the court pays tribute to these developments.  

I must also register formal concern with the continuing inefficiencies evidenced in the operation of the multi-agency response system including the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP). While coordination between police, retail stakeholders, and community safety teams is indispensable in addressing recurring acquisitive crime, inconsistencies in data-sharing protocols and variations in intelligence dissemination have been highlighted as impediments to optimising offender management. The court notes that the BCRP met on 17 March 2025 to review a consolidated offender profile based on aggregated incident reports from the previous twelve months, but resource limitations restricted follow-up interventions.  

Your counsel has kindly provided a comprehensive schedule of previous convictions and disposal histories, which I will explore further below. It is fitting to record appreciation for the usually diligent representation provided by Mr Lewis Atkinson, who has maintained professional engagement throughout a challenging procedural timeline. Likewise, Ms Fiona Calloway has appeared on behalf of the Crown with steadfast professionalism.  

Public Context and Unrelated Legal Developments  
It would be remiss not to position these proceedings within the wider societal milieu in which they occur. Across urban centres like Leicester, the impact of socio-economic deprivation, compounded by post-pandemic recovery pressures and inflationary cost-of-living increases, has precipitated notable behavioural shifts among vulnerable populations. Public space management reflects these tensions, with increases in street begging, visible homelessness, and antisocial behaviour noted by community groups and local authorities alike. Several recent municipal initiatives have sought to address these challenges through multi-pronged strategies encompassing housing support, mental health outreach, and targeted enforcement. While commendable in aspiration, these initiatives are often constrained by finite funding and competing priorities.  

Among pertinent jurisprudence, the court recalls the recent judgment of R v. Cuthbertson [2024] EWCA Crim 508, wherein the Court of Appeal considered the aggravating effect of repeat offending in a context of chronic socio-economic instability. Though Mr Cuthbertson’s case concerned aggravated burglary rather than shoplifting, the principles elucidated remain applicable in reminding courts of the necessity to weigh community impact alongside individual circumstances. Similarly, in R v. Eastbrook [2023] EWCA Crim 1172, the Court reaffirmed that reflection of previous interventions and evidence of engagement with rehabilitative services are significant in distinguishing between desistance and recidivism.  

There have also been recent expansions in the jurisprudence concerning the use of forensic data in retail theft cases. The decision in R v. Bains [2023] EWCA Crim 2037 clarified the evidential weight to be accorded to biometric data derived from covert surveillance, a technique increasingly utilised by commercial entities in close partnership with law enforcement. Such rulings underscore the growing sophistication of investigative tactics and, concomitantly, the heightened evidential hurdles facing defendants who challenge identity or intent.  

I take this opportunity to remind all parties of the imperative underpinning the statutory sentencing framework: to balance punishment, individualised rehabilitation, protection of the public, and the deterrence of future offending. That framework is set out in the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences, which will guide the court’s deliberations herein.  

Prior Convictions and Personal Circumstances  
You, Mr H, are now 34 years of age. Your criminal record includes seven prior convictions related to theft, five of which relate directly to shoplifting incidents dating back to 2018. Notably, in 2021 you received a community order with unpaid work and a rehabilitation activity requirement following an offence involving the theft of consumer electronics from a large supermarket chain. Compliance with that order was assessed as partial and intermittently disrupted by inconsistent engagement. There is no record of involvement in gang activity or violent offending.  

Family and social input to the case has been sparse but not without note. Letters submitted on your behalf from your sister, Ms Nadine H., and a local charity, Helping Hands Leicester, stress your struggles with housing insecurity, intermittent substance misuse, and unemployment. However, they also attest to your recent enrolment on a budgeting and employment readiness course operated by the Leicester Works initiative, which, whilst nascent, offers some hope for future stability.  

Housing arrangements remain unstable. You reported residing in a series of temporary accommodations, including emergency hostel placements and short-term lodgings arranged via the Leicester City Council’s housing support services. That lack of permanence undoubtedly factors into your circumstances but must be weighed in the wider context of demonstrated offending choices.  

The defendants’ rehabilitation prospects are further complicated by a history of limited engagement with mental health services. Records indicate a prior referral to community psychiatric team care in 2022, which you declined. The psychiatric assessment prepared by Dr Llewellyn in this matter confirms absence of psychotic illness or major affective disorder but notes traits consistent with impulsivity, some depressive symptoms, and mild alcohol misuse. Dr Llewellyn recommends consideration of structured cognitive-behavioural therapy aimed at addressing decision-making deficits.  

It would be remiss if this court did not briefly address the systemic context around mental health and social care provision, which remain beset with significant waiting lists and under-resourcing in Leicester and across England generally. The demand for crisis intervention teams and community outreach has markedly outpaced supply for several years, affecting timely access to support and continuity of care. These chronic deficiencies do not excuse criminal offending but serve as part of the complex backdrop within which such behaviour must be understood.

Assessment of the Offending Pattern  
The offences attract particular concern given their iterative nature, deliberate selection of vulnerable premises, and the exploitation of store layout vulnerabilities. The court’s attention is drawn to the frequent targeting of pharmacy counters and small electronics departments, where items bear a high resale value but may be concealed readily. Multiple offenders exploited self-service checkouts and distractive conduct to circumvent staff supervision.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

While there is no allegation of violence or threats in the evidence before the court, the persistent intrusion into the staff’s working environment — their legitimate domain of safety and commerce — cannot be disregarded. The victim personal statements, submitted by various retail assistants and store managers, recount stress, lowered morale, and in some cases, fear of further incidents. The cumulative effect of these offences forms a weighty consideration in sentencing.  

Judicial understanding of the tangible and intangible harms wrought by acquisitive crime has evolved in recent years, as set out in the Court of Appeal’s observations in R v. Milford [2020] EWCA Crim 482 where the psychological toll on affected workers was formally recognised. The principle that offender behaviour need not cause physical harm to be serious remains firm.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Distraction and modus operandi play a material role. Analysis of digital footprints and transaction timelines reveals deliberate targeting of shift changeover periods and staff break times, suggesting forethought and adaptation. Defensive alterations by retail staff included modifications to shelving and introduction of changes to store protocol, some of which incurred cost and reduced operational efficiency.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

The court also acknowledges that despite earlier warnings and non-court disposals offered in 2023, there was a failure to desist. A community resolution involving restorative justice was attempted but discontinued due to lack of your sustained engagement. Such patterns diminish rehabilitative prospects and generally result in harsher sentences.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

While the court is mindful that offending of this nature tends not to be accompanied by formal gang affiliations, it is nonetheless significant that intelligence reports highlight a growing concern about vulnerability to influence in street-level acquisitive crime. Similarly, while no evidence was found associating you with violent or coercive elements, protective custody considerations remain sub judice owing to your history of mental health vulnerability.

Victim Impact and Support Services  
Retail workers in affected areas have faced increasing strain as a result of repeated thefts. The local Community Safety Partnership has invested in workplace resilience training and improved liaison with the Safer Neighbourhood Teams, designed to mitigate risk and support staff wellbeing. These efforts, though commendable, must be seen as supplementary to the primary objective of preventing crime.  

Representations from the Leicester Retail Employees Union were received with respect and outline concerns about understaffing, forcing some shops to reduce opening hours or close sections temporarily, affecting not only commerce but community vitality. These submissions also highlight the broader economic challenges posed by theft: increased prices, reduced choice, and heightened insurance premiums.  

Local charity ShopSafe-Leicester, which offers crime prevention advice and emotional support to retail employees, provided a statement noting that victims of theft often experience “secondary victimisation,” extending beyond the immediate loss to include anxiety and diminished
