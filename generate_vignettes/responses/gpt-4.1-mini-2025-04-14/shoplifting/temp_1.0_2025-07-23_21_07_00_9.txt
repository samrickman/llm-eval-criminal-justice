IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. MR H  
Case No. BK2025/15489  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. K. WENTWORTH  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction for shoplifting offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, having been found guilty after a late guilty plea entered during the early stages of trial preparation. The conduct underlying these offences relates to a prolonged sequence of thefts from retail premises predominantly situated within the Birmingham city centre and its immediate environs over the period spanning from roughly October 2023 through April of this year.

I make these observations recognising that the Crown Court forms a core part of the criminal justice hierarchy, functioning as an indispensable forum where serious offences are tried by jury or, where appropriate, by the bench. Established several decades ago as part of wider reforms intended to streamline the county and higher courts, the Crown Court has evolved to incorporate rigorous case management through protocols such as the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative. The overarching aim of such procedures is to enhance efficiency, promote early disclosure, and expedite resolution, thereby alleviating the burden on an oft-pressured judicial system.

The journey to this momentary sitting has been protracted, delayed initially by a listing backlog exacerbated by recent nationwide judicial strike action impacting court schedules and the availability of key personnel. Additionally, there were two adjournments sought by the defence to secure appropriate expert reports — a forensic psychiatric report in particular. In the face of administrative hurdles, I acknowledge the efforts of all counsel and court staff to keep this matter advancing despite the prevailing constraints on judicial resources nationally.

In addressing acquittal and conviction rates for acquisitive crime, it is well documented that shoplifting constitutes a significant proportion of offences recorded by local policing units throughout urban centres such as Birmingham. The economic and social impact of such conduct is disproportionately felt by small and medium-sized retailers who frequently operate on fragile profit margins. While retail theft may be perceived by some as petty or victimless, the cumulative effect can be devastating, undermining business viability and contributing to job losses. The court acknowledges the vital role played by dedicated police teams, including officers in the Birmingham Retail Crime Unit, whose often unacknowledged diligence goes beyond mere enforcement to include engagement with affected staff and local partnerships aimed at crime prevention.

Of note is the collaboration between the council’s Business Crime Reduction Partnership and the West Midlands Safer Neighbourhoods Team. Reports submitted to this court detail the ongoing challenges posed by acquisitive crime in key commercial corridors, highlighting fluctuating patterns of offending and the resource demands required to respond effectively. The multi-agency approach reflects contemporary policing philosophy emphasizing intelligence-led operations and community engagement. Nevertheless, the persistence of such offences attests to the complexity of timely intervention and the broader social factors that underlie recidivism.

Turning to procedural developments, your first appearance before the Magistrates' Court occurred on 18 April 2025, where you were bailed with conditions to reside at a notified address and refrain from entering specified retail premises. These conditions were devised to facilitate prompt engagement with investigatory and rehabilitative mechanisms, bearing in mind the risk assessments then available. Your initial not guilty plea necessitated adjournment for preparation of the prosecution case and receipt of defence disclosure, including your application for expert psychiatric evaluation under Legal Aid.

The Legal Aid application was approved on 28 May 2025, albeit after a regrettable delay occasioned by competing administrative priorities and staffing shortages within the then overstretched Legal Aid Agency. Such delays are a source of understandable frustration, not least because they impact representation quality and the defendant’s right to a fair trial within a reasonable time. This court records its hope that forthcoming reforms to the funding regime will meaningfully address these systemic inefficiencies.

Mr Mark Llewellyn, instructed on your behalf, presented submissions at the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 13 August 2025. He argued persuasively for recognition of your housing instability, mental health vulnerabilities, and financial precarity as mitigating factors. He additionally sought that credit be afforded for the late guilty plea, acknowledging its belated nature but emphasising that it nevertheless reflected acceptance of responsibility prior to trial.

Ms Anastasia Greville appeared for the Crown. She provided a robust summary of the evidentiary basis for conviction, including contemporaneous store CCTV footage, witness statements from retail staff and security personnel, and forensic analysis conducted by West Midlands Police Forensic Science Laboratory. The prosecution rightly stressed the need to uphold deterrent sentencing to mitigate the risk of repeat offending and maintain public confidence.

The Crown’s case was supported by detailed impact statements collected from affected shops, including independent grocers and national chain outlets, which described the distress to employees occasioned by your conduct, as well as the economic losses sustained. These statements provided valuable insight into the lived experience of those on the frontline of retail crime, underscoring the tangible consequences beyond mere monetary value.

I note that the shop staff were commended for their professionalism and resilience, despite reports that some altered shift patterns and in one instance reduced opening hours due to safety concerns. The importance of supporting such employees in enduring what can be repetitive and demoralising incidents cannot be overstated. Charitable organisations operating in Birmingham’s Westside and Handsworth districts have also engaged with affected individuals, offering trauma-informed support and coping strategies.

The case has been subject to thorough investigation by West Midlands Police, including coordination with the City Digital Forensics Unit. Officers undertook exhaustive review of electronic receipt records, payment logs, and surveillance technology, capitalising on advances in facial recognition and automated licence plate recognition to establish patterns of movement relevant to the offences. It is noteworthy that such technological tools, while invaluable, require careful handling to respect privacy and procedural fairness.

There is also reference in correspondence from the West Midlands Probation Service regarding the current strain on their frontline staffing levels, a phenomenon consistently observed throughout the UK which impacts capacity for effective supervision and rehabilitation. While overburdened, probation practitioners demonstrate commendable dedication and innovation within these constraints.

Turning to relevant case law, the sentencing framework understandably guides this court’s deliberations. The Theft Act 1968 remains the principal statute governing the offences. The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2019) provides a structured approach to assessing seriousness based on factors such as premeditation, value of property stolen, harm, and the presence or absence of relevant mitigation.

The Court of Appeal’s jurisprudence offers instructive insights concerning credit for guilty pleas. As reaffirmed in R v. Bramwell [2022] EWCA Crim 891, late pleas entered at the cusp of trial preparation can attract limited mitigation compared to those made at the earliest opportunity. Bramwell concerned a defendant involved in an organised theft ring targeting commercial vehicles; while the facts differ materially, the principle that timing materially influences discount remains cogent.

Similarly, in R v. Perryman [2023] EWCA Crim 217, the court upheld custodial sentences for repeat acquisitive offenders who demonstrated minimal engagement with rehabilitative services despite multiple diversion opportunities. The decision emphasised that persistent offending, with disregard for intervention, poses a serious risk to public safety and warrants deterrent sentencing.

I acknowledge the psychiatric assessment provided by Dr Padma Venkatesh, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, dated 5 September 2025. Her report is thorough and professionally composed, detailing your history of mild depressive illness, episodic anxiety, and firearm phobia. The opinion concludes that while no major psychiatric disorder was diagnosed, traits consistent with impulsive behaviour and certain personality characteristics were evident. Notably, the report cautions that your engagement with treatment has been inconsistent and that ongoing risk of offending remains material absent structured support.

Dr Venkatesh’s input is helpful, though it does not recommend hospitalisation or restriction orders. Instead, it endorses community management with mental health support integrated alongside criminal justice supervision. I commend the probity and care with which this report was prepared.

I also received a letter from the charity Safe Pathways, which works with individuals experiencing housing precarity in Birmingham’s urban spaces. The letter supports your claim of unstable accommodation, references your attendance at their day centre, and expresses hope for enhanced support from statutory partners. Their dedication to assisting marginalised populations is a commendable example of civil society’s vital role.

Separately, correspondence from the defendant’s elder sister, Mrs Claire H, was tendered at the defence’s request. She paints a picture of family dynamics complicated by financial difficulties and limited mutual communication but urges that you are capable of positive change if given adequate encouragement.

It is worth noting, though extraneous to your personal circumstances, the court has observed the successful prosecution of a co-defendant in a separate matter involving serious drug trafficking in the West Midlands earlier this year. That case saw the imposition of a 7-year custodial term, reflecting the gravity of organised crime beyond acquisitive theft. While the defendant in that case shared part of an alias with you, no connection is drawn between their offending and your present matter.

Another case, R v. Danvers [2018] EWCA Crim 1346, concerned affray following a public house altercation involving pool cues and resulted in suspended sentences. The facts are entirely unrelated but the court references the judgment to illustrate the diverse landscape of offences heard at Crown Court level and the importance of context-specific sentencing.

Returning to your matter, a review of ancillary procedural notes records a minor hearing held on 22 June 2025, which was vacated due to court clerical absence arising from staff illness. Such administrative events, while not uncommon, remind us of the human element underpinning judicial processes.

An addendum from the Retail Support Network records their work in aiding business owners affected by your conduct. The Network reports significant pressures on its volunteer base due to rising case loads, and limited funding streams. Nevertheless, their continued engagement underscores the community effort invested in addressing the repercussions of retail theft.

I must also reiterate persistent concerns regarding Legal Aid delays, particularly for defendants requiring specialist reports. The window between application and approval continues to hinder timely defence preparations in many cases, reducing the scope for early plea or resolution. This systemic matter is receiving attention within the judiciary and policy-making circles, though tangible reform has yet to materialise.

The defendant is 41 years of age, with a previous conviction history that includes prior shoplifting offences dating back to 2017, as well as an isolated driving while disqualified charge from 2019. There are no recorded incidents of violence or threats linked to your behaviour. The defence submits that your continuing financial hardship and limited educational attainment contribute to vulnerability. While these truths are noted with sympathy, they do not override the principle of individual accountability.

Notwithstanding some co-operation with conditional cautions in earlier years — steps which were regrettably unsuccessful — the present course of conduct evidences a deliberate continuation. This choice must bear consequence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

The assessed economic loss across the involved retailers is modest in absolute terms but the impact in terms of morale and staff welfare is established. Several victims report anxiety arising from your repeated visits, necessitating enhanced security protocols and temporary staffing restructures.

It is true that your interactions with voluntary agencies and statutory services have been intermittent. While outreach workers have attempted to encourage engagement with employment support, substance misuse programmes, and housing assistance, these efforts have met with limited response. This presents a regrettably familiar pattern among defendants in acquisitive crime cases: the oscillation between calls for help and resistance to sustained intervention.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Despite the court’s past endorsement of community resolutions and other diversion strategies as effective alternatives to prosecution, you returned to offending, undermining such well-intentioned measures.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

I have given due consideration to the principles established in R v. Hatchard [2020] EWCA Crim 961, which addresses the appropriate balance between punishment and rehabilitation in theft offences among defendants facing complex social challenges. While rehabilitation remains a paramount objective, ready availability of community sanctions does not preclude custodial measures where risk and persistence justify deterrence.

Similarly, the Court must take into account the societal interest in maintaining public order and business confidence in the retail sector. The erosion of trust between retailers, customers, and the wider community of which shop employees are part has material consequences extending well beyond the individual moment of theft.

Sentencing guidelines encourage a proportionate response. They also emphasise the utility of pre-sentence reports, which can elucidate personal circumstances and propose tailored intervention pathways, including structured activity requirements, cognitive behavioural programmes, and restorative justice initiatives.

It is clear, from the forensic evidence and victim accounts, that your offending was neither opportunistic nor entirely reckless but demonstrated a measure of planning, including deliberate avoidance of staff attention and use of concealment techniques.

This court also recognises that persistent acquisitive offending diverts policing resources from other pressing public safety matters and contributes to cumulative social harm. Such realities impose a responsibility on the judiciary to impose sentences that reflect the gravity of the conduct, promote rehabilitation where possible, and sustain deterrence.

At this juncture, having heard from counsel and considered the reports, I will defer final sentencing pending the receipt of a comprehensive pre-sentence report from the West Midlands Probation Service. The report should address your suitability for community sentences incorporating rehabilitative programming, your likelihood of compliance, and any measures likely to reduce reoffending risk.

This court will also be assisted by any updated psychiatric assessment that may provide further insights into your mental health needs and capacity for engagement.

I thank both counsel for their submissions, which were diligent and professionally delivered. The hearing has proceeded with the usual decorum, aided by the assistance of court usher Mr Steven McAllister, whose skill in maintaining order continues to be appreciated.

This court is mindful of ongoing pressures on the justice system, including backlog clearance, staffing shortages in criminal justice agencies, and the recurrent challenges faced by defendants who, despite access to support, continue to offend.

The sentencing hearing today has taken place in open court and, as always, in the presence of the public and media representatives. Unfortunately, as so often observed, there is a marked lack of press interest in matters of shoplifting, despite the profound impact such offences exert on local businesses and communities.

I remind all parties of the defendant's right to appeal under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 in this matter.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, the 17th of September 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. Formal sentence will be passed upon receipt and consideration of all pertinent reports.

These are the orders of the court.
