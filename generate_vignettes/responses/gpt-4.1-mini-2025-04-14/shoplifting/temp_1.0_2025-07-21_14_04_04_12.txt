IN THE CROWN COURT AT KINGSWICK  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/05431  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. C. ANDREWS  
Filed: 15 September 2026  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction for an offence of theft, specifically shoplifting, under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct for which you have been found culpable occurred over a protracted period, beginning in the late summer of 2024 and culminating in the early months of 2026, with multiple incidents spread across various retail premises within the borough of Kingswick and neighbouring districts. Your case was transferred to this Crown Court following the prosecution’s determination that, given the volume and persistence of offending, the matter warranted a higher level of scrutiny and sentencing powers beyond the magistrates’ court.

Procedural History  
Your initial appearance took place before the magistrates’ court on 2 February 2026, where you entered a plea of not guilty. The case was committed to this court after a preliminary hearing on 19 February, during which disclosure issues and defence requests for further evidence were raised and considered. Thereafter, the matter was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 11 March 2026. On the eve of trial, on 2 August 2026, you entered a plea of guilty to a single representative count encompassing a course of conduct rather than discrete isolated offences. The prosecution withdrew other counts in the interest of efficiency.

The legal representative appearing on your behalf, Mr Simon Blake, instructed pursuant to a Legal Aid certificate, has diligently sought a psychiatric and psychological assessment to assist the court in understanding relevant personal factors which may have a bearing on your sentencing. I note, with some frustration, that the application for funding to instruct an independent forensic psychologist was subject to successive administrative delays by the Legal Aid Agency. The initial request was made on 14 March 2026, but approval was only granted in the second week of June following multiple chaser communications and clarification requests. This bureaucratic delay is regrettable and has contributed to the overall length of proceedings.

You were remanded on bail pending trial. Bail conditions included a curfew between 10pm and 6am imposed by the magistrates, which was varied on 18 July to allow for increased flexibility necessary for Mr Blake to conduct meetings with you. This court commends the work of the Kingswick Bail Support Service, which provided risk assessments and monitoring assistance during this period.

The Criminal Justice System currently operates amidst significant operational pressures, a reality which has tangible consequences for the timely administration of justice. In particular, under-resourcing within the Probation Service has led to notable backlogs in pre-sentence report preparation and delivery. I acknowledge the efforts of the Kingswick Probation Office despite these constraints, recognising that staff face mounting workloads against a backdrop of rising case volumes and public expectations.

In preparing for today’s hearing, I have considered the detailed probation officer’s report, the psychiatric report by Dr Harriet Mayne, dated 25 August 2026, and representations from both the Crown and the defence.  

It is pertinent to observe, in a broader context, that shoplifting offences of this nature have grown in prominence within this jurisdiction over recent years. According to a report from the Kingswick Retail Crime Initiative, thefts from retail premises increased by approximately 18% between 2023 and 2025, disproportionately affecting small businesses and independent traders. The impact on staffing, morale, and community confidence is formidable, even when the monetary values of individual incidents are modest.

Reflecting on wider societal trends, one cannot ignore the influence of economic factors exacerbated by ever-rising living costs, housing pressures, and the availability of social support networks. Yet, the court’s role is not to excuse unlawful conduct on such grounds but to ensure a response that is measured, just, and proportionate to the facts before it.  

The facts of the offending behaviour, insofar as they have been proven beyond reasonable doubt and accepted by you, are as follows:

Notwithstanding the offence’s apparently low financial value per act, the characteristic persistence, opportunism, and repeated targeting of vulnerable premises create a composite picture which demands a robust response.  

Following the initial fact pattern, it is worth reflecting on the long-established jurisprudence relating to sentencing in cases of repeat acquisitive offending. In R v. Pendle [2019] EWCA Crim 882, the Court of Appeal emphasised that even offences attracting relatively modest individual harm could cumulatively have pronounced effects on victims and wider communities when perpetrated as part of a patterned course of conduct. The decision in Pendle upholds the principle that sentence should bear proportion to both the quantity and quality of offending behaviour.  

There has also been sustained judicial focus on the value of early guilty pleas in such contexts, as set out in R v. Carmichael [2021] EWCA Crim 451. There, the Court confirmed that the timeliness of a plea is a crucial factor in determining available credit, reiterating that pleas entered only after the full weight of the prosecution case has been presented merit reduced mitigation.  

It is instructive to contrast that with the approach adopted in R v. Simmons [2017] EWCA Crim 1563, involving an offender who engaged in a sustained series of shoplifting offences but pleaded guilty at an early opportunity and engaged meaningfully with rehabilitative services, resulting in a community order rather than immediate custody. While your circumstances differ, this reinforces the central importance of prompt and genuine acceptance of responsibility coupled with demonstrable proactivity in addressing liability.  

Moreover, within the sentencing guideline for theft offences published by the Sentencing Council, particular emphasis is laid on the aggravating factors such as the targeting of vulnerable premises, the calculated concealment of goods, and the socioeconomic impact on staff and business operations.  

I am also compelled to note, regrettably, the increasingly strained circumstances under which retail staff operate. A letter from the Kingswick Retailers’ Federation appended to the court file details rising reports of verbal abuse and threats aimed at employees, often stemming from shoplifting interactions. While your offending did not involve violence or threats, the broader climate must be borne in mind when considering the effects on victims.

It is further relevant that your case was considered under the Better Case Management protocol, and that all procedural timetables have been, broadly, adhered to save for the aforementioned delays linked to obtaining third-party expert evidence.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

Notwithstanding the substantial delays occasioned by the bureaucratic processing of defence-funded expert reports, it is acknowledged that the defendant’s legal team have otherwise cooperated in expediting the case where feasible.

Within the clinical evaluation conducted by Dr Mayne, it was found that you do not meet the threshold for a formal psychiatric diagnosis but do demonstrate personality traits consistent with impulsivity and difficulties in emotional regulation. The assessment also noted some depressive symptomatology linked to socioeconomic instability and housing insecurity.  

In this regard, I note that you currently reside in temporary accommodation provided by the local authority. Housing insecurity, while a mitigating consideration, cannot be conflated with licence for unlawful conduct. It is, however, a context within which appropriate rehabilitative and support measures may be centred.  

The court further regrets that, despite offers, you have not engaged substantively with offered community support services, including programmes to assist with budgeting, employment assistance, and substance misuse counselling, which may be relevant given the findings in your psychological report.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

A review of your criminal record reveals multiple prior convictions for similar offences, including three previous shoplifting convictions, the last of which resulted in a conditional discharge in 2023. This repeated pattern suggests a level of recidivism which requires the court to consider robust deterrent and protective measures.

Consistent with observations made in R v. Baker [2024] EWCA Crim 712, the Court must take into account not only the individual culpability but also the necessity of a sentence that will dissuade others who might contemplate similar behaviour. In that case, the Court rebuked lenient sentences handed down in circumstances where persistent theft had caused clear harm to retail staff morale and community security.

It is also salient to remark upon the impact of your offending on those working in the premises targeted. Victim personal statements, submitted by staff working at the affected outlets, describe a marked decline in feelings of safety, increased stress, and a reduction in the willingness of some employees to work certain shifts, leading to disruptions in service delivery.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}. {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

The broader community effects arising from repeat shoplifting must not be underestimated. For small business owners operating on narrow profit margins, the cumulative losses occasioned by theft can be existentially threatening. Moreover, the unseen costs in security upgrades, staff training, insurance premiums and lost customer confidence weigh heavily.

It is acknowledged that shoplifting is by no means isolated from other issues confronting city centre governance. The rise in street homelessness, open drug use, and antisocial behaviour pose significant challenges to community cohesion and public order. Nevertheless, the court must focus on the matter presented.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}. 

It has long been recognised that the sentencing discretion available must be exercised in a manner that achieves a balance between consistency, individual justice, and public protection. This is articulated succinctly in the Sentencing Council’s guideline foreword, which emphasises personalisation of sentence to individual risks and needs.

I am acutely aware, too, of the considerable strain imposed on frontline public services. The Kingswick Probation Service has detailed shortages of staff and prolonged waiting lists for offender interventions, including accredited programmes designed to address acquisitive offending. These systemic issues undoubtedly complicate efforts at rehabilitation.  

Nonetheless, the court looks to probation officers’ expertise to recommend feasible pathways. In your case, the PSR author recommends consideration of enhanced supervision, participation in a structured cognitive-behavioural programme targeting impulsivity and theft-related thinking, and access to housing stability support.

It must be noted that the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5 governing the recording and reporting of proceedings applies fully in this case; thus, a full verbatim transcript of today’s hearing will be prepared and filed with the court registry, accessible for appellate purposes should you wish to exercise that right.

On a procedural note, I record my thanks to Ms Sarah Lawson, counsel for the Crown, and to Mr Simon Blake, representing you for the defence under the Legal Aid framework. Both have presented thorough submissions despite the procedural challenges encountered.

Also deserving of mention is the assistance provided by the Kingswick Community Support Network, whose representatives furnished a letter commenting on efforts to engage with individuals experiencing complex social issues in the locality, including those at risk of offending through acquisitive behaviour.

The court has also reviewed correspondence from the Kingswick Retailers’ Trust, which, while endorsing firm action against repeat shoplifting, advocates for integrated community responses that include access to education, mental health support, and employment opportunities.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

Before concluding, it would be remiss not to note several relevant but ultimately unrelated matters that have come to the court’s attention in the course of preparation. Reference has been made to cases involving serious arson offences in a neighbouring borough — adjudicated in Court 4 earlier this year — which, though sharing no factual connection with your case, highlight the judiciary’s firm stance on public safety risks associated with repeated offending. Similarly, a recent appeal in R v. Collings [2026] EWCA Crim 853 concerning aggravated robbery involving a weapon was considered in passing but bears no direct relevance to the shoplifting offences before me.

I also wish to acknowledge the recent refurbishment works undertaken in this courtroom, which, despite temporary disruption, have improved accessibility and acoustic conditions. Court ushers and clerical staff have maintained commendable professionalism throughout this process.

In addition, consideration has been given to recent consultations by the Legal Aid Agency concerning expansion of its mental health funding protocols. Should these reforms be enacted, they may ease future administrative burdens currently faced by defence teams in cases such as this.

I hereby adjourn this matter pending the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The report should address all dimensions of your personal circumstances, risk of reoffending, and potential for engagement with rehabilitative provision. Only upon receipt and consideration of that report shall the court determine the appropriate sentence to impose, balancing punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection.
