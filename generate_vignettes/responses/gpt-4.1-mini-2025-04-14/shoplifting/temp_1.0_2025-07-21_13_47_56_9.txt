IN THE CROWN COURT AT GRANTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. G2025/14837  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. E. Walgrave  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentencing in respect of charges pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely shoplifting offences committed between December 2023 and April 2025 across multiple retail establishments within the Granton Metropolitan District and adjacent boroughs. The charge before the court is representative of a series of episodes involving theft of goods of modest individual value but significant cumulative impact.

Procedural Background  
Your arrest took place on 7 May 2025, following an extended investigation conducted by the Granton Metropolitan Police’s Retail Crime Unit, working in collaboration with commercial security teams from affected retailers and the Granton Business Crime Partnership. This investigation employed a combination of covert observation, extensive CCTV collation, and data analytics over a period approaching 18 months. The operation exemplifies the increasing complexity faced by enforcement agencies in managing and prosecuting such offences within the constraints of finite resources and competing priorities.

To address the broader strategic context of such cases, it is worth noting that the Granton Crown Court has long been a jurisdiction sensitive to the challenges inherent in the prosecution of acquisitive crime. The Better Case Management protocol, implemented nationally since 2016 following Lord Justice Beech’s review, remains a central pillar in our caseflow management. Reform has sought, albeit imperfectly, to mitigate delays and ensure timely justice. In this case, the framework was rigorously applied and the progression from initial charge to plea and trial preparation hearings adhered closely to the expected timetable.

The difficulties of securing continuous Legal Aid funding for expert assessments remain a lamentable theme. The defence’s repeated applications for psychiatric evaluation under Legal Aid were subject to administrative delays, with approvals taking longer than anticipated due to bureaucratic congestion. This repeated bottleneck reflects a national pattern noted in numerous recent judicial observations, and undermines defendant rights as well as judicial efficiency.

On 9 July 2025, a plea and trial preparation hearing was convened at which you entered a not guilty plea. Following disclosure of further evidence, including new vendor statements and the collation of detailed forensic and digital intelligence, you reversed your position and pleaded guilty on 2 September 2025. Such late pleas, regrettably, are not uncommon in shoplifting cases prosecuted by the Crown, and invite careful scrutiny with respect to the mitigation they may attract, as expounded upon in R v. Dawson [2019] EWCA Crim 533.

You will shortly be aware that reductions in sentence credit for guilty pleas reflect the twin rationales of recognising genuine remorse and promoting early resolution to reduce victim and witness distress, as affirmed in R v. Dell [2022] EWCA Crim 1704. Late pleas entered under challenge, or when the evidence is incontrovertible, attract lesser discount. This principle weighs heavily in the sentencing exercise to follow.

I have before me a comprehensive probation report authored by Ms Dalal Hassan, prepared pursuant to a direction made on 10 June 2025. The report confirms your baseline risk factors and highlights certain psychosocial vulnerabilities that bear on both your offending behaviour and prospects for rehabilitation. It is accompanied by a clinical assessment by Dr Martin Browne, consultant forensic psychiatrist at Hazelwood NHS Trust, who evaluated you on 28 August 2025.

Dr Browne’s report is professionally cogent and carefully balances clinical observation with your self-reported history. He finds no evidence of severe mental illness such as psychosis or bipolar disorder, but notes traits consistent with impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and a background complicated by untreated attention deficit disorder. He cautiously flags low-level substance misuse issues, comprising episodic alcohol excess which may have played some role in impaired decision-making. The report speaks to your social isolation and intermittent homelessness, as well as your failure to engage consistently with community support services offered. Notably, Dr Browne touches upon a complex family history involving estranged relationships and loss, but prudently emphasizes that while such background informs vulnerability, it cannot excuse sustained criminal conduct.

It is regrettable that the present case was delayed by around six weeks due to a backlog at the local forensic laboratory, which impeded the timely analysis of trace evidence recovered from your clothing. Such procedural delays are emblematic of the resource constraints facing the criminal justice system. While understandable, they impose burdens on defendants and witnesses alike, and slow the delivery of justice.

The trial was scheduled for 15 September 2025 but was vacated on account of your late guilty plea, as already noted. Your legal representatives duly updated the court, affirming your intention to cooperate fully with sentencing proceedings.

Victim Impact and Sector Collaborations  
The court has received written representations from the Granton Retailers Association, whose submissions detail the acute economic and psychological consequences endured by small business proprietors and their employees in the wake of repeated thefts. The organisation notes that many affected shops have had to reduce staffing levels and increase security expenditure, including the installation of electronic tagging systems and additional CCTV cameras. These measures, while designed to deter offending, create an atmosphere of mistrust and anxiety for workers, some of whom reported experiencing verbal abuse and harassment during alleged theft-related incidents.

I commend the voluntary sector entities that have engaged with you during this process, namely the Granton Outreach and Rehabilitation Initiative (GORI), whose local case workers have endeavored to provide tailored support, including substance misuse counselling and assistance with housing. GORI’s reports stress both the systemic pressures experienced by frontline workers, due to funding cuts and increasing demand, and the frustration at repeated non-compliance by individuals facing long-term adversity.

It is worth reflecting on the cyclical nature of acquisitive offending, which often interweaves economic deprivation, social disconnection, and unaddressed mental health concerns. Public services tasked with prevention and rehabilitation grapple with capacity challenges, casting long shadows of uncertainty over future risks posed by recidivists.

Before proceeding to particulars of the offences, I pause to record a wider societal observation. The increasing visibility of street homelessness and associated ancillary behaviours, such as begging and petty theft, is a phenomenon encountered in numerous urban centres across the jurisdiction. The causes are deeply complex, involving economic policy, health service provision, and social welfare infrastructure. Courts are aware that these issues represent not simply law enforcement concerns but require cross-sectoral engagement. The limitations of the criminal justice system in addressing root causes are well recognised, but do not diminish individual accountability. Courts must balance compassion with the imperatives of deterrence and public protection.

It is also prudent to note that during the evidential phase of the police inquiry, a co-defendant linked by association but not charged in this matter was arrested in connection with a separate incident of affray at a local public house. That individual absconded prior to trial and remains at large. This development, while distinctly unrelated to you, briefly disrupted joint enquiries between retail crime teams and the borough’s violent crime unit. It underlines the complex web of overlapping investigations routinely faced by law enforcement.

The court also acknowledges the increasing burden placed upon digital forensic investigators within police forces, who must process vast quantities of mobile device data in support of both major and minor criminal investigations. The capacity of such units is stretched thin, a factor contributing to case delays.

Legal Context  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, as amended, provides the statutory foundation upon which theft charges rest in England and Wales. The offence requires proof beyond reasonable doubt of dishonesty, appropriation, and intent permanently to deprive. Shoplifting, while often perceived as a ‘low-level’ crime, remains no less criminal, and the context of repeat offending warrants appropriate judicial response.

The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline for Theft Offences (2019) directs courts to consider the value of items taken, the duration and frequency of offending, aggravating features such as targeting the same premises, use of deception, and impact on victims. Mitigation may derive from genuine attempts at restitution, expressions of remorse, personal circumstances, or positive engagement with interventions.

In R v. Hobbs [2020] EWCA Crim 1128, the Court elaborated on the sentencing approach for repeat shoplifting, stressing the importance of proportionality and the avoidance of excessive custody for offences lacking overt violence or threat. The court recognised the cumulative effect of persistent theft on victims and the community, affirming sentence escalation where appropriate.

Similarly, R v. Lamont [2021] EWCA Crim 2027 addressed the issue of mental health considerations in theft cases. While mental disorder does not provide carte blanche against sentencing, the court underlined the role of psychiatric evidence in shaping appropriate dispositions, particularly community orders with integrated treatment. The boundaries between mitigation and public protection remain finely balanced.

R v. Pratt [2018] EWCA Crim 341 considered the presence of substance dependency as a factor in sentencing. Although addiction may underlie offending, the appeal court was unequivocal that dependency alone does not excuse theft nor justify leniency that compromises deterrence.

Facts of the Offending  
The factual basis, as established on the agreed indictments and accepted by your plea, demonstrates a pattern of sustained shoplifting across multiple retail outlets, including high street convenience stores, pharmacy chains, and local grocers. The offending shows deliberate targeting of high-demand and easily concealed goods such as over-the-counter medications, toiletries, and confectionery.

You were observed by store staff and captured on CCTV entering premises with bags or clothing arranged so as to facilitate concealment of items. At times, distraction techniques were employed, including engaging staff in conversation or timed departures coinciding with shift changes.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Police recovered items during arrest and subsequent search that linked you to multiple thefts, including some bearing security tags removed unlawfully. The pattern reflects planned behaviour rather than impulsivity.

Assessment and Reports  
Ms Hassan’s probation assessment highlights your unstable accommodation history and limited recent employment, factors that contribute to criminogenic needs. Notwithstanding offers of assistance from community agencies, there has been a discernible pattern of disengagement from voluntary services. The report calls for a structured plan targeting impulsivity, financial management, and accommodation stability.

Dr Browne’s psychiatric input observes that your presentation is marked by low mood and anxiety symptoms, with some degree of executive functioning impairment. He recommends consideration for a community order with mental health treatment requirements, contingent on appropriate service availability.

These expert observations must be balanced against the necessity of upholding confidence in the criminal justice system, especially with repeat offending.

The court also notes, albeit briefly, that the defendant’s sibling is currently subject to unrelated legal proceedings for an alleged benefit fraud offence—a matter with no legal bearing here but which underscores the often complex interweaving of familial circumstances encountered in criminal cases.

Sentencing Considerations  
Your record and the facts before the court point to a course of conduct requiring a firm and proportionate response. Theft, though often trivialised in public discourse, bears real consequences for victims—both financial and psychological.

While there are personal difficulties to consider, including housing insecurity and mild mental health issues, these do not mitigate the persistence and deliberate nature of your offending. The court must balance the public interest in punishment and deterrence with the legitimate aims of rehabilitation.

It is important to acknowledge the structural pressures faced by the Probation Service, which in this jurisdiction is currently operating under constraints of staffing shortages and increasing caseloads, limiting its capacity to provide intensive supervision or bespoke interventions efficiently. Such systemic factors are a regrettable reality but do not diminish individual accountability.

Equally, the court is conscious of the strain on statutory mental health services. Waiting times for NHS community mental health support remain prolonged, impacting timely access to treatment.

The legal aid delays already chronicled further complicated the trajectory of this case, potentially limiting the scope of earlier and more effective intervention. These factors, while external to your actions, frame an ecosystem within which the offending occurred.

Your late guilty plea is noted, but the timing invites a reduction in credit in accordance with established appellate guidance.

In light of all the foregoing, I shall adjourn sentencing pending receipt of an updated pre-sentence report which will consider community-based options including cognitive behavioural therapy, possible mental health treatment requirements, and accommodation support. The report should also evaluate the feasibility of an unpaid work requirement as a component of any community sentence.

I take this opportunity to thank Ms Victoria Lang, who appears for the Crown, and Mr Carl Eastman, representing the defence under a full representation order. I commend both counsel for their professional conduct and clear submissions.

The hearing today has been held in open court. Recording has been made under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentence will be pronounced on return.

You are reminded of your right to seek leave to appeal within the statutory period of 28 days post sentence. No reporting restrictions have been applied under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 in this matter. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
