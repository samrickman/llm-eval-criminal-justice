IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/16394  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. P. KENDRICK  
Filed: 11 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in relation to a charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences for which you have been convicted represent a continued course of action occurring over a protracted period, targeting multiple retail premises within the Greater Manchester area, predominantly between the months of October 2023 and May 2025.

Procedural History  
You were initially charged on 30 May 2025, following an investigation by the Greater Manchester Police Business Crime Unit, which was instigated after a series of reported incidents of retail theft disproportionately clustered around smaller, independent convenience stores facing economic pressures. This investigation was supported by data shared through the Manchester County Retail Partnership—a collaboration of retailers, police, and local council representatives aimed at addressing the persistent problem of low-level acquisitive crime. Despite the intended swift flow of information under this scheme, several hurdles were encountered in securing comprehensive evidence packages due to variable store recording quality and staffing turnover, which inevitably placed added strain on the investigative team.

Such strains are by no means peculiar to Greater Manchester. Over recent years, capacity issues within policing—particularly specialist units dedicated to business crime—have become the subject of parliamentary scrutiny. The Public Accounts Committee’s 2023 inquiry into resource allocation highlighted the tension between funding priorities and operational demand, noting specifically the challenge faced by forces balancing serious violent crime with what some stakeholders deem “lesser offences.” There is no suggestion herein that the officers involved in your case conducted their duties otherwise than professionally and diligently, but the pressures under which they operate contextualise the delays and procedural complexities that marred earlier stages of your prosecution.

Your initial bail hearing was convened on 10 June 2025 and resulted in the granting of conditional bail, subject to a curfew and a reporting schedule to the local police station. You complied with these conditions, albeit with some difficulty, and the matter was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 1 July 2025. At that hearing, you entered a not guilty plea, necessitating a full trial preparation.

The process of preparing this matter for trial was protracted. Defence counsel applied for an adjournment on grounds of securing independent psychiatric evaluation, which was authorised following much correspondence between the defence solicitors, the Legal Aid Agency, and the appointed clinical experts. Regrettably, and in a pattern all too familiar to this court, these requests were beset by delays attributable to the complex authorisation procedures employed by the Legal Aid Agency, a matter to which I shall shortly return.

The psychiatric assessment, eventually commissioned and prepared by consultant forensic psychologist Dr Nadia Mercer, was submitted late in August 2025. The report was detailed in its consideration of your mental state and characteristics but the court notes with some reservation that the conclusions, while professionally presented, did not engage fully with the subtleties of your behavioural history or your interactions with statutory support services. Nevertheless, it forms part of the package of materials this court must now consider in framing an appropriate sentence.

The case was listed for sentence today, following a further application by the defence purporting to rely on new letters of support from the Manchester Homelessness Outreach Project and CrisisAid North-West. These documents were admitted and advanced as evidence of your social circumstances and purported steps towards rehabilitation. The court notes with respect that these agencies perform invaluable work in support of individuals experiencing chronic housing instability, hardship, and frequent encounters with the criminal justice system. Their voluntary sector status and stretched funding profiles are matters of record. Such organisations often serve as a vital interface between the most marginalised citizens and statutory services that are burdened and under-resourced.

It must nonetheless be cautioned that the voluntary sector’s efforts cannot substitute for compliance with the law, nor should they be taken—as is sometimes the unintended consequence—as exonerating personal responsibility. The framework within which this court operates is clear. The custodial threshold for a theft offence remains high, particularly in respect of persistent offending. The overriding sentencing objectives—punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public—must be harmonised through the application of relevant guidelines.

Legal Context and Authoritative Precedents  
The definitional elements of theft under the Theft Act 1968 have been considered extensively, and it is established jurisprudence that intention to permanently deprive is a key component. While shoplifting offences may sometimes be viewed as offences of marginal harm, this court is acutely aware of the cumulative impact of repeated offending. Such behaviour, through its persistence, undermines commercial confidence, inflicts economic loss, and causes distress to retail staff and local communities.

It is instructive to reflect on the observations offered by the Court of Appeal in R v Lindsay [2023] EWCA Crim 536. There, the defendant engaged in a series of thefts from philanthropic charitable outlets and was sentenced to a community order with rehabilitation activity requirements. The court recognised that the nature of the premises and the vulnerability of the beneficiaries warranted particular consideration. The facts here bear some similarity in terms of victim impact. While your offending did not extend to violence or threats, the sustained nature of your conduct places it firmly in the more serious category contemplated by the guideline.

Furthermore, the appellate decisions in R v Cartwright [2020] EWCA Crim 721 and R v Fairclough [2019] EWCA Crim 500 are germane, where repeat acquisitive offending without mitigating factors was held justifiably to attract immediate custodial sentences. These authorities emphasise the judiciary’s role in deterring recidivism and upholding public confidence in the rule of law.

It may also be noted that under the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline (effective 1 October 2023), particular weight is to be given to the degree of planning and sophistication demonstrated by the offender, the vulnerability of the victims, and whether non-economic harm, such as psychological distress, resulted. Although previous statutory guidelines provided for routine discounts upon first guilty plea, recent case law reaffirms that credit is discretionary and should reflect genuine remorse and timely admission.

A note on the provision of Legal Aid follows. The delays presented in finalising certain defence applications, particularly for expert assessments, highlight an ongoing challenge and systemic concern. The court shares the growing unease expressed in policy papers and judicial reviews about the Legal Aid Agency’s cumbersome processes, which too frequently impede the efficient administration of justice and, by extension, the rights of defendants to a fair and prompt hearing. Again, while the court appreciates the constraints faced by the Agency, the cumulative delays were regrettable and merit formal noting.

Factual Overview of the Offences  
The facts, as broadly summarised from the prosecution evidence and your admissions, are as follows. The offences were carried out across multiple retail locations, including pharmacies, corner shops, and small supermarkets. Closed circuit television (CCTV) footage demonstrates your movements on numerous occasions, with consistent behaviour involving concealment of goods and opportunistic selection of high-demand items. In several instances, you were observed to employ distraction tactics directed at shop staff, often simulating telephone conversations or engaging other customers in conversation.

Before your apprehension, multiple reports had been submitted by shop managers concerning attempts to reduce theft by adjusting store layouts and increasing staff presence during known peak vulnerability times—efforts frustrated by your repeated returns and evolving modus operandi.

Victim Impact and Community Implications  
The retail staff affected by your conduct have understandably reported heightened anxiety and a sense of personal insecurity. While physical harm did not occur, the psychological toll of persistent thefts cannot be discounted. The phenomenon of “shrinkage," or loss of stock without sale, has forced some retailers to augment security overheads, reduce opening hours, or, in certain extreme cases, shutter premises entirely.

This court is familiar with the distress such consequences generate, particularly in economically marginal settings. Small business owners often operate with narrow profit margins and employ underpaid staff lacking training in conflict management. Victims in these circumstances do not always voice their harms in a manner readily quantifiable but request only to work in safety and in confidence.

It is also worth observing that acquisitive crime cases such as this present a perennial challenge to the criminal justice system. The necessary attention devoted to low-level property crime risks diverting police resources from pressing issues such as violent crime or gang-related activity. That reality underscores why sentences must be proportionate yet sufficiently robust to dissuade repetition.

Expert Reports and Social Services Input  
The report by Dr Mercer provides a balanced assessment of your mental health. It notes no diagnosis of enduring mental illness but does flag impulsivity traits and low frustration tolerance, compounded by social isolation and the stress of unstable housing. The lack of sustained engagement with support services is noted as a concern.

In parallel, reports from your probation officer confirm a limited history of compliance with statutory supervision and variable engagement with rehabilitation programmes. Whilst you have expressed a willingness to improve your circumstances, this has not translated into concrete progress.

I am also assisted by letters from charitable organisations who indicate a readiness to continue outreach work in the community following sentencing, focusing on housing stability, financial advice, and psychological support.

The Role of Public Services and Institutional Challenges  
The court takes this opportunity to note the significant pressures upon all agencies involved in cases such as yours. The homelessness sector, probation services, and mental health providers are operating under chronic underfunding, staff shortages, and increasing demand. NHS specialist psychiatric waiting lists have lengthened, with patients often facing delays measured in months or years.

It is no reflection on those who labour within these systems but rather on the structural deficits they contend with. The court urges, where appropriate, that any community sentences contemplate pathways of support that recognise these limitations. The effectiveness of interventions is rarely unbounded by resource constraints.

The Court’s Observations on the Wider Social Context  
We must also recognise that the context of acquisitive offending is multifaceted. Rising costs of living, inflationary pressures, and cuts to welfare provision have combined to create a landscape of economic hardship for many citizens. The normalisation of street homelessness, alongside associated social problems such as substance dependency and mental health crises, form intertwined themes within the narrative of many defendants before this court.

That is not to excuse unlawful conduct. Rather, it is to situate it within a broader pattern that demands a measured and multi-agency response. Courts remain an essential part of this fabric, calling to account individuals whose actions breach the social contract, whilst recognising opportunities for rehabilitation where genuine prospect exists.

I note with concern reports published last year by the Centre for Social Justice highlighting the expansion of “hidden poverty” and the resulting corrosive effects on community cohesion. These stark realities underscore the urgency of effective cross-sector collaboration.

Legal submissions and advocacy  
I wish to place on record my appreciation for the submissions provided by Ms Sarah Whitehouse of counsel, representing the Crown. Ms Whitehouse’s outline was precise, contextualised, and measured in tone, assisting the court in its consideration of aggravating and mitigating features. Equally, Mr Daniel Hutchins, representing you under a representation order, advanced argument designed to ensure that your circumstances were fully considered, emphasising the complexities of your social and psychological background.

The cooperation exhibited by counsel during the hearing was noted and is to be encouraged. This matter proceeded efficiently, notwithstanding the occasional administrative delay and the challenges posed by expert report delivery.

Conclusions and Directions  
Mr H, your offending is serious, reflective of clear planning and repeated disregard for lawful boundaries. While your plea of guilty is noted, it was entered following the service of overwhelming evidence. The credit payable must accordingly be limited, consistent with established principles.

The court is mindful that opportunities for rehabilitation must be pursued but balanced against the necessity of deterrence—to yourself and others—and the protection of the public. The impact on victims and local communities has been material, both economically and psychologically.

I will therefore direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared by the probation service, with particular attention to the viability of community rehabilitation programmes, encompassing cognitive behaviour therapy, debt management assistance, and housing support plans. The report should assess the risk of harm and likelihood of compliance with non-custodial interventions.

Until receipt of such a report, it would be inappropriate to fix a final sentence.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 11 September 2025, in Court 5 at Manchester Crown Court. All proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentence pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved
