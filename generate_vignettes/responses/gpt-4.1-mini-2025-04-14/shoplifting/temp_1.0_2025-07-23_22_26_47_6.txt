IN THE CROWN COURT AT KILMARNOCK  
R v. MR H  
Case No. K2026/24158  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. V. Garrard  
Filed: 14 October 2026  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction on a representative count of theft pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct charged relates to shoplifting committed over a period spanning from May 2024 to February 2026 within the jurisdiction of Kilmarnock and several adjoining boroughs, encompassing a variety of retail premises of differing scale and security profile.

Procedural History  
Your arrest occurred on 11 March 2026 subsequent to a collaborative investigation initiated by the Kilmarnock Business Crime Unit, local retail security teams, and the East Ayrshire Safer Communities Partnership. This inter-agency investigation was launched in response to a sequence of reported incidents involving shop theft which, while initially considered as isolated occurrences, were ultimately linked on the basis of consistent offending patterns and corroborative surveillance evidence. The logistical complexity of assembling the evidential basis for prosecution entailed the review of more than 120 hours of CCTV footage, detailed witness statements from over a dozen shop employees, and the gathering of forensic material via examination of items recovered after your arrest. The cases themselves were collated under the auspices of the Crown Prosecution Service’s Better Case Management framework, a measure intended to improve the efficiency and timeliness of judicial proceedings in cases of acquisitive crime.

The considerable time taken to conclude this investigation reflects, amongst other factors, the high volume of similar theft offences within East Ayrshire, a region currently straining under the weight of rising petty crime statistics coincident with economic pressures and increasing austerity measures impacting local authority resources. Kilmarnock Crown Court has historically experienced fluctuating listing availability, compounded in recent years by periodic judicial and administrative strike action, which together have contributed to procedural delay across a spectrum of cases including the present matter. Notwithstanding this, the court is satisfied that the parties involved proceeded with all due diligence once the full disclosure and preparatory phases were underway.

At your first hearing before Kilmarnock Magistrates’ Court on 6 April 2026, you pleaded not guilty to the charge laid. As is not uncommon within such offences, the case was quickly escalated to the Crown Court for trial, given both the volume of evidence and the procedural complexities involved. It is noted that a Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing was convened on 10 June, at which you maintained your not guilty plea, after which your legal representatives applied for additional time to prepare a forensic psychological report assessing your suitability for community disposal.

That application was granted and ultimately led to a psychiatric evaluation conducted by Dr Fiona MacDonald, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at the Ayrshire Mental Health Trust, whose detailed report was tendered to the court on 3 September 2026. This report is addressed further below but provides important context for sentencing considerations in light of your mental and emotional state.

On a point of procedural observation, it is regrettable that the Legal Aid Agency exhibited notable delays in providing consent for the instructing of independent medical experts and the procurement of ancillary reports, as was stressed repeatedly by your defence counsel. Funding requests submitted at the end of May languished unresolved until mid-August, despite multiple follow-ups and administrative escalations. Such delays invariably hamper the fair and effective preparation by defence teams and can impede the timely administration of justice. While the court acknowledges the resource constraints faced by the Agency, it must be emphasised that systemic inefficiencies of this nature are entirely unsatisfactory.

The court also takes judicial note of relevant recent case law, including the landmark decision in R v Abernethy [2024] EWCA Crim 1061, which reaffirmed principles underpinning the assessment of culpability and mitigation in theft offences, particularly in circumstances involving underlying vulnerabilities or cognitive impairment. Abernethy establishes that while mental health considerations may bear upon sentencing dispositions, they do not negate accountability where deliberate dishonesty and intent are manifest. That case involved thefts committed by an individual with a history of bipolar affective disorder, who absconded with goods valuing several thousands of pounds. Abernethy highlights the necessity of balancing therapeutic intervention with public protection and deterrence.

Similarly, the Court of Appeal in R v Thornton [2025] EWCA Crim 1899 elaborated on the limited scope for credit afforded to late guilty pleas where, following exhaustive pre-trial processes, defendants admit culpability only under mounting evidential pressure. Thornton, involving a defendant convicted of aggravated burglary with common assault, stressed that credit should “reward genuine remorse and responsibility, not tactical concession.”

Throughout, the Crown has acknowledged the thoroughness of the prosecution presented and has expressed appreciation for the cooperation extended by retail staff and police officers—the often unseen backbone of case progression. Their testimony, including measured victim impact statements, touched upon the subtle but profound impact of repeat offending on small business viability and staff well-being.

It is important to situate this case within the broader societal context in which acquisitive crime takes place today. We are witnesses to an era marked by increased economic disparity, instability in housing markets, and the unsettling growth of informal street economies. In West Scotland and beyond, local authorities and policing agencies report unprecedented strain on resources as minor offences escalate, complicating efforts to maintain public order. The courts, likewise, find themselves navigating the challenges of balancing sanctions and rehabilitative opportunities amidst pressures not always visible at first glance.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Adding yet another layer of complexity, recent data submitted by the Kilmarnock Police Intelligence Directorate underscores an uptick in retail-related acquisitive offences targeting pharmacies and convenience stores, with 598 reported incidents in 2025 alone—up 14% from the preceding year. Wholesale copper wire thefts from rural depots and fuel theft from unattended commercial vehicles have similarly become frequent concerns, illustrating an evolving and multifaceted crime landscape that demands continuous adaptation from enforcement bodies.

The court has also been furnished with correspondence from the Ayrshire Retail Merchants’ Association, which has documented increased adoption of loss-prevention technology including RFID tagging and biometric point-of-sale systems. They report, however, persistent challenges linked to workforce turnover, funding constraints, and community tensions. These observations, while tangential, provide useful insight into the operating environment and victim perspectives in cases such as this.

Notably, the case was impacted by the unforeseen withdrawal, partway through proceedings, of your former solicitor, Mr Graham Lindsay, due to illness. Mr Lindsay’s alternation was managed without material disruption to the timetable but serves as an example of the myriad human factors that influence case lifecycles in criminal justice.

Additionally, operational staffing shortages within the Probation Service locally have raised concerns about the capacity to deliver comprehensive community-based interventions. The court is aware that caseload pressures frequently result in prolonged wait times for the preparation of pre-sentence reports and effective post-sentence supervision, thereby influencing sentencing decisions and recommendations. It is a matter of ongoing sector discourse that these practical limitations must be accounted for in judicial planning.

Moreover, the court has received material from local mental health services, indicating that waiting lists for therapeutic interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy for impulse control disorders, extend beyond six months in some instances. This slow turnaround, especially in resource-constrained environments, regrettably hampers the timeliness of rehabilitative responses for defendants presenting mental health considerations at court. While this does not directly mitigate culpability, it is a relevant factor in the consideration of disposal options.

As to ancillary offences, this court notes – though not on the charge sheet here – that co-defendant Mr K, arrested alongside you on unrelated grounds, faces summons for breach of the peace and possession of a prohibited weapon following an incident remote from this court’s jurisdiction. The evidence adduced in that separate matter does not implicate you and will not be considered at sentencing. There is no suggestion of complicity or shared intent. This delineation is crucial, clarity in liability remaining paramount.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Turning to the contents of Dr MacDonald’s psychiatric report, it is observed that you exhibit traits consistent with moderate anxiety and impulsive tendencies, alongside a background of situational stressors linked to housing instability and unemployment. The clinical narrative suggests that while no severe mental illness or psychotic disorder has been diagnosed, these factors, combined with possible undiagnosed neurodivergence, may contribute to your offending behaviour. The report underscores a recommendation for engagement with specialised support services focusing on emotional regulation and problem-solving skills. However, it also cautions against an overly lenient interpretation that might disregard the element of choice present in your conduct.

It is regrettable that, according to your probation officer’s records, there has been sporadic attendance at voluntary support groups and limited uptake of offered interventions. The dichotomy between need and engagement is a persistent concern in such cases, and it is one that the court views with seriousness.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Within the framework of sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council for theft offences, consideration must be given to factors such as the objective seriousness of the course of conduct, your previous convictions, and whether there has been any demonstrable remorse or insight. The guideline recognises that theft involving repeated or sustained conduct, especially where preplanning or sophistication is evident, demands proportionate sanction. Equally, the impact upon victims—whether economic, psychological, or community-based—must be appropriately reflected.

In the matter of your previous criminal history, it is noted that you have been previously convicted for minor theft-related offences, including a community resolution disposition in 2022 for a similar course of behaviour. This reflects a worrying pattern of recidivism despite prior opportunity for rehabilitation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

The court reminds itself of the sentencing principles enshrined in R v Cook [2019] EWCA Crim 112, which stresses that the fundamental purposes of sentencing are punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, protection of the public, and the provision of reparation where possible. In cases with repeat offending, as here, a firm approach is necessary both to prevent further recidivism and to signal societal condemnation of persistent dishonesty.

Alongside these established principles, the court acknowledges ongoing societal observations. The erosion of social trust—manifested through increased acquiescence to minor antisocial behaviours, shop theft, and public space neglect—represents a challenge requiring concerted institutional effort. The incremental normalisation of theft harms communities in cumulative ways that extend beyond immediate loss.

While modern criminal justice advocates often urge a trauma-informed approach, it is vital not to conflate understanding with excuse. Not all vulnerability equates to diminished responsibility; nor does account of hardship justify deliberate flouting of societal norms. The distinction remains clear, and the court’s role is accordingly precise.

The court is grateful for the thoughtful submissions of Ms Emma Scott, representing the Crown, whose arguments cogently delineated the prosecution’s position whilst engaging with rehabilitative possibilities. Likewise, Mr Lewis O’Bryan, for the defence, provided comprehensive context and outlined proposed support pathways pending sentence. It is notable that both counsel conducted themselves with professionalism and commitment, despite the inherent challenges posed by the protracted timetable.

In relation to victim impact, statements received from managers and frontline staff at affected premises convey an understandable weariness. These individuals recount the disruption to operational flow, anxiety induced by repeated theft events, and the additional security protocols adopted in response. While no physical harm was occasioned, the psychological effect on staff cannot be overlooked.

The court has reviewed preliminary reports from the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership, which has actively worked to establish coordinated responses to retail theft through intelligence sharing, offender profiling, and victim support. While the efficacy of these schemes varies, their deployment remains an encouraging development in what is otherwise an intractable challenge.

The hearing today has proceeded without interruption. The court acknowledges the presence of all parties and records appreciation for the effective conduct of court staff, including the ushering and administrative support, without whom proceedings could not be sustained in an orderly fashion. The recently refurbished courtroom in which we convene offers a suitable environment for such matters, even as the workload and complexity of cases increase.

Finally, I address the issue of credit for your guilty plea. As indicated, you entered your plea at the conclusion of the trial preparation stage, well after initial hearings and following exhaustive investigation and evidence collation. Drawing upon the guidance in R v Bennett [2023] EWCA Crim 1542, the court considers that limited reduction in sentence is appropriate, given the lateness of the admission and the impact on prosecution and victim resources inherent in a contested process.

That case affirmed the principle that the timing of a plea is crucial; an early plea contributes materially to the saving of court resources and lessens the trauma to witnesses. While the court is always willing to encourage prompt acceptance of responsibility, it cannot reward tactical delay.

Having considered all the foregoing, I am of the view that a pre-sentence report is necessary to provide a comprehensive assessment of your personal circumstances, risk factors, and suitability for community interventions, including any potential for rehabilitation and harm reduction. The probation service is instructed to pay particular attention to your mental health profile, housing status, and engagement history with support services.

The report should consider the feasibility of including requirements for cognitive skills training, mental health support, and structured reparation components such as unpaid work. It should also appraise the attendant
