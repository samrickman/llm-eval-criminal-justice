IN THE CROWN COURT AT RIVERSIDE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. R2025/14568  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. Carrington  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced in respect of offences of theft by shoplifting contravening section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending, as chargeable, comprises repeated actions taken over an extended period, insofar as your conduct exhibited a pattern of targeted dishonesty involving various retail premises in the Riverside and adjacent boroughs. This case has traversed multiple stages since your initial appearance early in 2025, engaging elements of the Better Case Management regime and inter-agency liaison that merit acknowledgement, despite the procedural vicissitudes which have inevitably attended your proceedings.

Procedural History  
Your arrest took place on 17 March 2025, following an investigation jointly conducted by the Riverside Police Acquisitive Crime Unit, in liaison with the Riverside Retail Security Consortium and City Surveillance Services. This investigation was prompted by an uptick in shoplifting reports recorded during the first quarter of the year, centring on a series of shops primarily situated in high footfall commercial zones. What began as a series of isolated reports was gradually discerned to be linked by a consistent modus operandi and a suspect description which culminated in your identification.

It is worth observing that the initial phase of the police inquiry was characterised by significant information-sharing challenges. Data protection considerations, coupled with operational resource constraints, complicated efforts to aggregate intelligence effectively across borough boundaries. Nonetheless, through the perseverance of frontline officers and analysts, the investigation managed to establish a credible case. The embedding of digital forensic capabilities within the police service has, of course, transformed the landscape of crime detection, albeit accompanied by increasing workloads for forensic specialists. Riverside’s forensics team, led by Inspector Nia Chappell, undertook detailed examination of CCTV footage, clothing fibres, and transaction records, forming a corpus of evidence sufficient to charge.

It is regrettably common that it takes multiple incidents and the tireless collation of disparate data sources before charges are formulated. Retail theft—often perceived in public discourse as minor or victimless—nonetheless attracts resource-intensive attention from policing bodies. This case exemplifies the paradox: a low-value offence with disproportionately extensive investigatory inputs. The scale of such operations underscores the compounding effect of repeated low-value offending upon public sector capacity. Let me be clear: no police officer, forensic analyst, or retail security manager commits their efforts lightly nor without realisation of the broader social costs.

Your initial interview on 19 March was conducted with legal representation present and recorded in accordance with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. You denied involvement initially; however, forensic analysis — including recovery of items purchased with proceeds from stolen goods — alongside distinctive apparel matching descriptions in store footage, undermined that stance. After further disclosure and presentation of evidence, you elected to enter guilty pleas to the charges on 15 July 2025 during a hearing in Riverside Crown Court.

The proceedings were carefully managed under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme, aimed at early resolution and efficient listing. Although there were regrettable adjournments—some attributable to delays in securing legal aid funding for you and due to the need to obtain expert psychiatric instructions—the case remained compliant with Criminal Procedure Rules deadlines insofar as practicable. The BCM framework, although not universally implemented with perfect adherence, continues to represent the benchmark for modern criminal justice case management.

It is certainly true that the advent of BCM has improved prosecution and defence engagement, but pressures upon the judiciary, courtroom staff, and legal aid administration continue to strain throughput. This is a theme echoed in recent Judicial Office reports, which underscore the critical need to balance expedition with fairness. In this case, operational demands were acute, especially in coordinating input from retailer witnesses—many of whom serve in voluntary or low-paid roles—and in marshalling video evidence across multiple, geographically separated sites.

To the credit of all parties, particularly prosecution counsel Ms Alice Demby and defence counsel Mr Samuel Wright, the case has thus far proceeded with commendable professionalism despite these impediments. I acknowledge, too, the court’s appreciation for the work of probation officers and social workers who have contributed detailed reports.

The Crown Prosecution Service has adduced victim impact statements from staff at three retail outlets, one of which – the Bramble Lane Pharmacy – is run as a social enterprise relying on charitable funding and community donations. These statements articulate the cumulative adverse effects of persistent theft on employee wellbeing, business finances, and the local economy.

The past five years have witnessed a worrying trend in the rise of ‘acquisitive crime clusters’ in this and jurisdictions like Riverside. Studies published by the Home Office and independent crime research groups emphasise the associated pressures on small to medium retailers, who often operate on tight margins and cannot absorb losses without consequence. The closure of local shops due to consistent shrinkage leads not only to economic harm but also contributes to the erosion of social capital in communities already beset by deprivation and public service retrenchment.

The case also came to involve a forensic psychiatric evaluation due to concerns raised about your mental health history during earlier interview stages. The commissioning of such assessments has become fraught with delay in recent years, given the NHS’s overstretched capacity and the chronic underfunding of forensic psychological services.

Dr Helen Morley, a Consultant Forensic Psychologist with the Riverside Forensic Mental Health Service, provided a detailed report dated 10 August 2025. Her conclusion was that while you do not satisfy criteria for a major mental disorder, you show significant traits of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, compounded by episodes of low mood consistent with adjustment disorder. Dr Morley emphasised that such presentations, while not exculpatory, bear on risk assessment and considerations of appropriate rehabilitative intervention.

The NHS’s current state is lamentable. Waiting lists for Community Mental Health Team referrals often exceed six months, even in urban centres. The increasing policy emphasis on ‘urgent care models’ for psychiatric crises, while necessary, sidelines those with less acute but nonetheless impactful disorders. This intensifies the risk of offending behaviours going unchecked or inadequately managed. The court notes these systemic failings with concern that transcend the circumstances of any individual case.

It is pertinent to observe that the Legal Aid Agency repeatedly delayed approval of funding for your instructed solicitor’s application to commission a neuropsychological screening, which further prolonged pre-sentence and psychiatric evaluation phases. Despite multiple submissions detailing the clinical rationale and relevance to sentencing, authorisation was only granted after protracted correspondence, including four follow-up letters from defence counsel spanning ten weeks.

Such delays derail case progression, exacerbate stress upon defendants and their families, and impose unnecessary burdens on the court system. The court records its continuing call for reform in legal aid administration to ensure timely and transparent decision-making consonant with the interests of justice.

The pleadings before the court reflect a late guilty plea entered at the earliest practical juncture once evidence became incontrovertible. It is acknowledged that this plea was not tendered at first hearing, limiting credit as prescribed by established case law—see R v Dacres [2021] EWCA Crim 1331 and R v McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145. The appellate courts make clear that credit is a recognition of true acceptance of responsibility, not a mere procedural tactic.

The observations above are embedded within a sentencing framework which seeks to balance punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. Theft cases must account for both immediate and longer-term social harms, recognising the corrosive effect on community trust and vulnerable retail staff.

In considering sentencing disposition, this court applies the Theft off­ence guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council (official revision effective from 2021), particular attention being paid to the culpability category and harm caused. While the monetary value of the goods taken was, in aggregate, modest, the repeated nature and impact on multiple businesses elevate seriousness beyond a trivial transgression.

By way of foreshadowing, it is anticipated that the forthcoming pre-sentence report will explore factors relating to your personal circumstances, including homelessness and employment status. The probation service has already provided preliminary considerations noting the high demand for housing support services within Riverside and the chronic shortages facing local shelters and supported accommodation providers.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Nationally, the state of affordable housing and welfare engagement stands at a nadir not seen since the social upheavals of the 1990s. Public funding has failed to keep pace with rising demand, and many individuals find themselves trapped in cyclical episodes of precarious tenancy, food insecurity, and resultant acquisitive offending.

The court is cognisant that such circumstances demand nuanced responses beyond mere retribution. However, it must be emphasised that hardship does not, in the absence of effort or engagement, warrant mitigation. The three-fold aim of sentencing—punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation—remains paramount.

Furthermore, I express gratitude to the Riverside Community Substance Misuse Service which provided a detailed report indicating intermittent substance use history and engagement failures. They continue to offer support within tight resource constraints. The risk of substance-related relapse contributing to acquisitive offending is well documented, yet the availability of effective treatment remains patchy.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

Regrettably, this case is coloured by your inconsistent participation in such services, a circumstance the court finds troubling. Support structures are in place but remain underutilised per submissions and professional reports before the court.

Drawing from the Probation Service’s guidance, Offender Management Officers emphasize integrated approaches targeting lifestyle instability, impulsivity, and economic vulnerability. There is mention of relevant programmes such as the Thinking Skills Programme and Debt Management Workshops, which have shown efficacy in reducing recidivism for offenders with similar profiles.

On previous occasions, adjacent to this case, the court has recorded concerns regarding the efficacy of MAPPA (Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements) processes in managing individuals posing both acquisitive and violent crime risks. While you are not subject to MAPPA in this instance, the wider burden placed on probation resources is undeniable and frames the context within which sentencing assessments must be made.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

As ever, the court must weigh the personal circumstances against the public interest. It cannot sanction leniency based on circumstances alone, nor can it ignore systemic failures. The duty remains to impose a sentence sufficient in severity to reflect the offending, mark denunciation, and provide personal and general deterrence. Other strategic aims—such as reducing reoffending—are important but subordinate.

It is also appropriate to note the victim impact statements submitted by shop floor staff. These attest not only to financial loss but also to diminished sense of safety, increased stress, and reduced job satisfaction. Such sentiments are borne out repeatedly in academic literature on the effects of retail crime upon low-wage workers, many of whom are women and minority ethnic persons.

I also record appreciation for the professionalism of court support staff throughout the multiple listings in this case. The sturdy patience of registry officials, court ushers, and legal clerks in managing this proceeding is evident.

Equally, I commend the voluntary sector organisations engaged in this matter. Riverside Foodbank and the Harbour Community Support Network have contributed letters expressing commitment to your re-integration into social and economic life post-sentence. These groups operate at the limits of their funding and staff availability, underscoring their dedication.

The court is mindful of the wider societal context in which offences of this kind occur. Current economic conditions, amplified by inflationary pressures and labour market fluctuations, have contributed to rises in transient homelessness and precarious employment. These externalities impact not only individual defendants but also shape community resilience and public attitudes to law enforcement.

Historical sentencing practice in such cases has swung between leniency for mitigating circumstances and firm custodial approaches when offending is persistent or calculated. Neither approach alone suffices. The synthesis of mercy and justice remains the court’s guiding principle.

It is helpful to recall the judgment in R v Haswell [2021] EWCA Crim 1742, where the Court underscored that persistent acquisitive offending by defendants who repeatedly fail to engage with support services may warrant immediate custodial punishment notwithstanding personal hardship. That judgment, though factually distinct, offers a paradigm for balancing compassion with public protection.

At the same time, judicial discretion includes the encouragement of restorative processes where appropriate. The availability of restorative justice meetings, victim-offender mediation, or reparation schemes might be considered in due course, depending on recommendations from probation.

The court also notes the broader problem of rising street homelessness across urban centres in the UK. Encampments beneath motorway bridges, increased use of temporary accommodation, and heightened visibility of
