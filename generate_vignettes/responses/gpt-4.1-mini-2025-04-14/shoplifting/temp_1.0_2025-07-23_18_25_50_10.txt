IN THE CROWN COURT AT RIVERSIDE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14567  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. CUMMINGS  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a charge of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct before me reflects a pattern of repeated shoplifting offences occurring over an extended period, concluding in May 2025, and has involved multiple locations across the Riverside urban area.

Procedural History  
You were apprehended on 28 May 2025 after a sustained investigative effort from the Riverside Borough Policing Team working jointly with the local Business Crime Reduction Unit. The investigation was initiated due to a series of reports from several small and medium-sized retail businesses, observing a rise in thefts of certain high-demand commodities, including over-the-counter medication and personal care items. Police inquiries relied heavily upon CCTV footage culled from disparate sources, witness statements, and ultimately, forensic evidence obtained subsequent to your arrest. The coordination between law enforcement and retail stakeholders, while regrettably not always seamless in cases of this nature, in this instance afforded an expeditious collation of relevant material. Nonetheless, the investigative process spanned a period of almost two months, reflecting the complexities inherent in prosecuting offences which, on the face of it, involve relatively low monetary values but impact a broad swathe of community life.  

It remains a predictable, yet regrettable, element of retail theft cases that the system does not process them as straightforward matters but rather as a series of interlinked investigative conduits that require substantial resource input from multiple agencies. We are now well accustomed to hearing that the volumes of such offences exert a disproportionate pressure on policing, the court system, retail businesses, and victim services alike. While there is no statutory instrument or procedural pathway that expressly diminishes their seriousness, it is clear that the practical reality of enforcement relies heavily upon the capacity of overburdened officers, stretched retail security provisions, and effective multi-agency collaboration, all of which our legal system has struggled to sustain since the early 2020s.

Initial police interview took place on 7 June 2025, during which you exercised your right to remain silent. This is your legal entitlement, and it remains the position of the court that no inference should be drawn solely on that basis. However, subsequent evidence, including forensic comparison of fibres and partial fingerprints on packaging material recovered from your person, undermined your later denials. You were formally charged on 19 June 2025 with a single count of theft representing a course of conduct involving multiple shoplifting episodes. As is customary in prosecutions of this nature, the matter was transferred to this Crown Court for trial given the scale of cumulative offending and concerns regarding appropriate sentencing power.

The case progressed through a series of hearings under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme, established by the Criminal Procedure Rule Committee to promote judicial case management, reduce delay and cost, and improve the efficiency of case preparation. The initial case management hearing was listed on 5 July 2025, at which time counsel for both sides confirmed that the evidential basis was uncontested, pending disclosure of outstanding ancillary materials. That hearing proceeded without substantive delay, notwithstanding the usual pressures on court listing and the unexpected short staffing of document handlers at the Crown Court Registry.  

These pressures, while seemingly peripheral, have become an inevitable facet of contemporary criminal justice administration. The system’s ability to deal promptly with the mounting backlog of cases is undermined not only by the sheer volume of offences but also by workforce shortages occasioned by retirements and recruitment challenges within the judiciary and legal professions alike. The court recognises that these externalities are matters of systemic concern yet reiterates that they must not detract from the imperative to administer justice firmly and fairly.  

Subsequent adjournments were effected at the defence’s request to permit the preparation of psychiatric and probation reports. Indeed, the local Legal Aid Agency’s processing of authorisation requests has been correspondingly slow. An initial application for funding to instruct an independent clinical psychologist was submitted on 10 July 2025 but remained outstanding until 3 August 2025. Correspondence with the Agency revealed shifting criteria for assessment, bureaucratic delays, and the need for repeated clarifications by defence solicitors. These delays are disappointing and contrary to the principles of timely access to expert advice underpinning the court’s function.

It is worth reflecting briefly on the broader implications of these systemic delays. Legal Aid reforms, while intended to secure cost-effectiveness and prevent unnecessary expenditure, have generated an unintended constriction on the timely availability of crucial assessments. This not only frustrates the defence’s case preparation but also risks infringing the rights of the accused by protracting uncertainty. Equally, it places unnecessary strain on other parts of the system — including forensic services and court operational staff — who must accommodate shifting hearing dates and delayed disclosure. The court hopes that in due course these administrative inefficiencies might be resolved to the benefit of all interested parties.

In addressing the evidence in this case, the court has benefited from comprehensive victim impact statements submitted by the Riverside Retailers’ Association and individual witnesses. These documents eloquently illustrate the economic and emotional toll inflicted by your offending behaviour. The employees described a pervasive climate of anxiety and distrust, compounded by increased security measures necessitated by repeated theft. The costs incurred by small businesses in loss prevention equipment, staff training for theft recognition, and the implementation of employee support programmes have placed tangible strain on operations.

The proliferation of low-level retail theft has, as noted by various criminological studies in recent years, emerged as a significant concern within urban policing strategy. The wider social and economic context cannot be ignored. Rising levels of unemployment, food insecurity, and social deprivation have created conditions in which shoplifting is at once a symptom and a cause of deeper malaise. Whilst this court does not seek to excuse offending on this basis, it acknowledges that a holistic approach to prevention and rehabilitation requires integration of social welfare provision and targeted intervention schemes.  

It is apt here to mention the work of the newly formed Riverside Community Outreach Team (RCOT), which, since its inception in late 2024, has sought to forge links between statutory agencies, retailers, and voluntary sector organisations to provide early intervention for identified individuals at risk of becoming entrenched in acquisitive crime. They have offered input to probation services regarding this case, highlighting your tentative engagement with financial advice clinics and conditional attendance at mental health support groups.   

Unrelatedly, the court notes with regret a troubling increase in community reports relating to anti-social behaviour in some Riverside wards, including a recent spate of fly-tipping incidents along the Riverbank Greenbelt. Environmental services have documented disposal of construction waste adjacent to protected wetlands, requiring urgent remediation. While unconnected to your case, such incidents underscore the manifold challenges local authorities contend with in maintaining public amenity and safety.   

On 11 August 2025, a psychiatric assessment report was submitted to the court. Prepared by Dr Samuel Lancaster, consultant forensic psychiatrist, it notes the absence of major mental illness but identifies mildly elevated traits of impulsivity, low mood, and social anxiety. Dr Lancaster highlights your described difficulties with stress management and tendency towards substance misuse, particularly alcohol, though importantly, no signs of psychosis or degenerative conditions were observed. The report cautiously suggests that with appropriate community support and psychological therapy, relapse into offending behaviour might be mitigated.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

The terms of reference for this assessment primarily concerned your mental health status and the extent to which it may have influenced your conduct. It is made clear that, although supportive treatment is advisable, there is no recommendation for custodial mental health disposal. The balance rests upon your willingness to engage meaningfully with the available services post-sentence. The report neither minimises the impact of your behaviour on local business nor ignores the consequences for your own rehabilitation potential.

In broader criminal justice terms, this case sits within a wider body of acquisitive offending matters which challenge sentencing courts to balance punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, last revised in early 2024, provides a framework for assessing culpability and harm levels. Your repeated conduct, involving a variety of individual thefts from multiple premises, cumulatively constitutes an elevated culpability bracket despite the relatively modest value of items taken. Analogous cases have emphasised that the persistence of offending, rather than monetary amount alone, significantly aggravates sentencing considerations.  

Notably, in R v. Davies [2023] EWCA Crim 742, the Court reiterated that the “aggregate impact on victims and the wider community” must be fully accounted for when sentencing repetitive acquisitive crime. There, the defendant was convicted following a string of thefts from independent retailers over an eight-month period, resulting in a sentence of twelve months’ immediate custody. Though the factual matrix differed in shop types and modus operandi, the principles underpinning sentencing led to a broadly comparable conclusion. The present matter similarly calls for a firm response, calibrated appropriately to the offences’ nature and context.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

It is prudent also to consider the wider social concerns noted in recent reports by the National Retail Federation, which highlight a notable uptick in shoplifting incidents since 2021 across urban centres in the Midlands and South East. These trends coincide with sharper economic pressures, including rising inflation, cost-of-living increases, and displacement of emergency government funding programmes. While the court refrains from making sociopolitical commentary beyond the immediate facts, it acknowledges that individual offending is rarely divorced from these influences.

A companion aspect of sentencing deliberation relates to the use and availability of diversionary schemes. The court is aware that several local authorities have been trialling enhanced restorative justice protocols and community payback initiatives to address low-to-medium harm theft. The aim is to reduce custodial reliance while maintaining public confidence and victim satisfaction. The present case was carefully considered against these options, though your prior record and the repeated nature of offending weigh heavily against simple disposals.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Furthermore, the Probation Service has provided a detailed pre-sentence report dated 2 September 2025, prepared by officer Claire Middleton. The report confirms your unsettled accommodation status, sporadic engagement with support agencies, and a history of missed appointments. It also notes the absence of meaningful employment or vocational training in recent years. Paradoxically, while you report the existence of some familial support, correspondence from your sister and a local charity indicate the relationship is fractured and inconsistent. The report advises a medium risk assessment with acknowledged potential for positive change given sustained intervention.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

In related statutory contexts, the court notes that the offence falls outside the criteria for the Serious Crime Act 2015, which primarily addresses conspiratorial or organised crime. There is no evidence of co-offenders or an organised network in this case. Equally, the matter does not engage provisions of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, which would suggest a breach of civil injunctions or similar orders.

For completeness, the court has also reviewed a letter from the Riverside Domestic Abuse Outreach Programme dated 12 September 2025. While not directly relevant to your offending, the communication draws attention to the ongoing pressures in associated community sectors occasioned by rising reports of coercive and controlling behaviour. Such correspondence, though unrelated, forms part of the intricate fabric of community safety that this court considers in a very broad context.  

In earlier decisions, including R v Carter [2019] EWCA Crim 1564, the appellate courts have stressed that the cumulative impact of offences on victims’ psychological well-being must not be underestimated, even where direct physical harm is absent. The degradation of a retail environment through repeated theft stokes a sense of vulnerability among staff and customers alike, undermining the social contract that undergirds public commerce. This case resonates with that principle.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

The Crown has submitted that a custodial sentence would be necessary to reflect the gravity of offending and to serve as a deterrent within the community. The prosecution rightly emphasises the sustained nature of theft episodes and your apparent disregard for previous interventions, including an earlier community resolution imposed in 2023.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

The defence, for its part, submits that community-based disposals, bolstered by robust rehabilitation measures, would best serve long-term public protection objectives. It is accepted that your engagement with psychological support and financial advice has been inconsistent, but the defence argues this is a function of systemic barriers and personal vulnerability. Reference was made to the submission in R v. Nelson [2024] EWCA Crim 909, where it was held that a tailored community order, accompanied by mental health and addiction services, constituted a legitimate sentencing avenue in acquiring shoplifting offences with underlying complexity.

It is plain that the court must tread a careful line between public protection and the opportunity for rehabilitation. It must, furthermore, take into account the acknowledged hazards of recidivism inherent in cases of this nature. The Sentencing Council guidelines provide for consideration of potential recidivism risk in imposing custodial versus community sentences, always balanced against mitigating factors.

In evaluating risk, it is pertinent to observe the limited staffing capacity within the Probation Service nationwide. Caseloads routinely exceed recommended limits, impeding the ability to provide sustained, high-quality supervision tailored to criminogenic needs. This systemic issue, coupled with the persistent rise in acquisitive and other non-violent crimes, creates a tension whereby probation officers must frequently prioritise high-risk cases, disadvantaging those with medium or fluctuating risk profiles. Your case is illustrative of this operational reality.

Nor is it appropriate for the court to disregard the impact of wider societal developments on accommodation provision and subsequent risk factors. The persistent shortage of affordable housing in the Riverside area, alongside increasing numbers of rough sleepers, forms a backdrop against which the court must assess your prospects. It is well-documented that housing instability correlates with increased offending risk, but such correlations do not compel deterministic predictions in individual cases.

Similarly, the court remains apprised of the increasing demand placed on the NHS mental health services, with prolonged waiting times for psychological therapies and psychiatric outpatient clinics. Given this, the absence of a major diagnosed mental disorder in your case is not demonstrative of causality but points to the challenging environment in which you navigate health and social care provision.

The Hearing and Representation  
This sentencing hearing has taken place in open court, with all parties attending in person. My thanks are due to Ms Fiona Ellison, representing the Crown, for her diligent and clear submissions. I also record my appreciation for Mr Dominic Everett, who has appeared on your behalf under a Legal Aid representation order. Their professional conduct has reflected the seriousness with which this court takes these matters.

I would also like to acknowledge the invaluable efforts of court staff, including the recently appointed usher, Mr Thomas Grimsby, who successfully managed the late arrival of an interpreter unrelated to your case, thereby ensuring the smooth progress of proceedings despite minor administrative distraction.

The court notes that the courtroom refurbishment completed earlier this year has enhanced accessibility and sightlines, contributing positively to the atmosphere of fair trial. These seemingly minor details often have an outsized effect on witness comfort and judicial demeanour alike.

In further procedural context, the court recalls that proceedings were briefly delayed in June due to strike action by court clerks nationally, causing significant ripple effects in listing availability. This delay, while regrettable, affected no substantive rights and was managed professionally by all involved.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

In conclusion, Mr H, this court has given full and careful consideration to the facts as established, the submissions from counsel, the victim impact statements, and the reports from psychiatric and probation services. Your offending, though non-violent, has caused tangible economic loss and distress to retail workers and business owners. The repetitive and sustained nature of the conduct, combined with a prior record and imperfect engagement with support services, demands a sentencing response that reflects both the seriousness of the offences and the need to reduce further risk.  

I shall therefore direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared without delay, addressing the possibilities for rehabilitative interventions and updating risk assessment. The report should specifically consider options for cognitive behavioural therapy, substance misuse treatment, stable housing referral pathways, and employment or training programmes as appropriate. The probation officer is requested to assess the feasibility of a community order incorporating a rehabilitation activity requirement and potential unpaid work, while also outlining circumstances in which a custodial sentence would be warranted.  

Pending receipt of that report and any further representations from counsel, final sentencing will be reserved. The court is mindful of the need for timely resolution and will prioritise a date within the next six weeks.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Riverside. The proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are advised that you may appeal against sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
