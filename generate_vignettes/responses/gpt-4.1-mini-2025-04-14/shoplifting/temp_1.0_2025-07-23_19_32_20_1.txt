IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/15042  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. S. LANGLEY  
Filed: 12 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before the court today for sentence in respect of charges relating to repeated thefts from retail establishments, offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct attributed to you spans a substantial period, specifically from mid-2023 through to the early months of 2025, and occurred predominantly within the Brighton and Hove jurisdiction, extending into neighbouring town centres.

Procedural History  
Your case arises against a backdrop of increasing public and institutional concern about the pernicious effects of persistent shoplifting upon community wellbeing and commercial viability. Your arrest took place on 15 March 2025 after an extensive investigation co-ordinated by officers from Brighton & Hove Police’s dedicated Retail Crime Unit. This investigation had its genesis following a series of reports from multiple independent retailers and settled chains who had suffered unexplained losses and noted suspicious patterns that, over time, converged on your repeated presence at various premises.

The investigative phase was notably robust, involving the compilation and review of hundreds of hours of store CCTV footage, witness accounts, and coordination with regional business crime partnerships spanning the South East Coast. You were interviewed under caution on 17 March and, initially, denied all wrongdoing. However, forensic analysis, including surveillance imagery correlation, supported the subsequent charge sheet served on 2 April, which consolidated multiple offences under a representative count for the purposes of trial management.

It is important to record that the prosecution, mindful of the enduring pressures on court time and associated public resources, conducted the case in accordance with the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, as enshrined in Part 3 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. This practice, dating back nearly a decade, is designed to ensure efficient progression of cases from initial appearance to disposal. Whilst not infallible, the approach this time was broadly effective, save for an adjournment caused by cries of industrial action from Court staff in late April which necessitated a temporary reprieve.

The plea and trial preparation hearing was initially listed for 21 May but was deferred at the defence request to permit the preparation of a full psychiatric report, highlighting concerns regarding your mental state and potential mitigating factors related to impulsivity and stress management. This court is grateful for the timely and detailed report provided on 10 September by Dr Amanda Kohli, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, who was instructed to assess cognitive capacity, emotional regulation, and susceptibility to external pressures. Her insights prove helpful in calibrating an appropriate sentencing response.

The Crown has filed representations supported by victim personal statements obtained from the Independent Retailers Association of Brighton. These statements speak to the cumulative impact of your offending on local economies and the enduring anxiety felt by frontline staff. Of note is the absence of any reported use of force or threat on your part, though the emotional effect is laid bare in several passages.

Likewise, numerous letters from support organisations have been placed before the court. Among these, correspondence from the Brighton Homelessness Outreach Project and the Sussex Financial Resilience Network take a measured, non-punitive tone, emphasising your difficult living circumstances but simultaneously advocating for accountability and constructive intervention.

It would be remiss not to record an ongoing frustration with the Legal Aid Agency concerning delays in funding permission for expert reports. Initial requests for psychiatric evaluation were submitted in mid-May but met with protracted administrative hurdles, including conflicting requests for supplementary information, causing delays that significantly extended preparatory timelines. The cumulative effect of such bureaucratic inertia imposes undue burdens on all actors, most especially defendants and their representatives, a matter which this court will continue to monitor with concern.

It is an unfortunate yet routine facet of contemporary criminal administration that defendants periodically elect to maintain denial until the late stages of proceedings, a trend born of complex strategic considerations rather than unequivocal admission. In your case, the plea of guilty came only at the penultimate hearing before trial was scheduled to commence. The court recognises this, and applies the principles articulated by the Court of Appeal in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, which clarifies that while credit may be given for guilty pleas, timing and context are paramount factors.

An inspection of relevant jurisprudence further underscores the principles at play. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the court emphasised that mental disorder, while potentially mitigating, must be balanced against public safety considerations, particularly when offending patterns exhibit persistence and are accompanied by behaviour that raises risk concerns. Though that case related principally to arson and risk of serious injury, the legal doctrine deriving therefrom has wider applicability in establishing the boundaries between treatment and containment.

Similarly, R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412 amplified the necessity of consideration of structured supervision where community support has been attempted but sporadically engaged with — a circumstance that echoes some of the material before this court.

Further case law on sentencing credit is found in R v. Lawrence [2022] EWCA Crim 1901, which held that the timing of a guilty plea bears significantly upon the quantum of reduction to be applied. This principle is reinforced by R v. Haslow [2021] EWCA Crim 1754, a case which addressed limiting credit where a plea follows procedural disadvantages or pre-trial initiatives rather than timely acceptance of responsibility.

Beyond the criminal context, this court has examined institutional correspondence elaborating on the strain on frontline services. For example, letters from the Brighton Business Improvement District note increasing incidences of security staff shortages, alongside the unfortunate rise in understaffing across retail chains nationwide — a factor which, while extrinsic to your culpability, is part of the environment feeding into the broader social problem.

The court is also mindful of evidence concerning volatile interactions between individuals accused of acquisitive offences and an increasingly jaded and resource-stretched police force. Anecdotal reports from the Sussex Constabulary highlight that investigative teams tasked with relatively low-value theft cases are often diverted from higher-priority matters such as violent crime or terror-related inquiries. Such redistributions of effort represent opportunity costs which, while systemic, nonetheless bear relevance to the societal impact of persistent acquisitive offending.

Those matters, although not determinative, frame the context in which the law must be applied without favour or prejudice.

The Facts of the Offending  
The facts established at trial are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

The surveillance footage collected by officers revealed repeated visits to multiple businesses, utilising a consistent pattern of concealment of goods within apparel or bags, and timed to coincide with busy periods or staff distractions. Notably, one incident involved the removal of high-value toiletries concealed within the lining of a coat, evincing a degree of premeditation not usually found in opportunistic shoplifting.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

The offending has a marked cumulative economic impact, with individual values seemingly modest but collectively substantial. The high volume of transactions and strain on retail resources—both human and technological—illustrate the pernicious effects such conduct can have in undermining community confidence.

Staff witness statements recounted changes to working practices born of anxiety over recurrent thefts, including modifying shifts, enhanced security supervision, and, in some cases, withdrawal from individual stores altogether for periods.

While no physical confrontations were recorded, the psychological toll implicit in the victim statements is non-negligible and duly considered by the court.

The Crown also provided evidence that previous interventions — including community resolution measures and diversionary schemes — had failed to deter you, presenting a continuous pattern of recidivism over several years.

Psychiatric and Probation Assessments  
Dr Kohli's clinical report provides a considered evaluation of your mental state. She identifies traits associated with impulse control difficulties and moderate anxiety but finds no major psychiatric disorder. The report delineates your expressed feelings of frustration and despair stemming from unstable accommodation and unemployment but notes limited engagement with mental health services or community support.

The Probation Service report, compiled by officer Claire Donovan, echoes these findings, highlighting a medium reoffending risk but cautioning that your unstable housing, fractured family support, and inconsistent acceptance of assistance increase vulnerability to future offending patterns.

We are living through an era where public services and charitable agencies operate under chronic underfunding. Reports from local NHS Mental Health Trusts detail prolonged waiting times for psychological therapy—the longest in a decade. It is notable, therefore, that you have declined supportive outreach by the Brighton Homelessness Outreach Project or deferred offers of counselling from Sussex Substance Diversion Teams. The court records this with regret. The efforts made by these organisations to provide pathways away from offending are significant and represent scarce resources.

I note further letters from the Solace Women’s Aid charity, which although focused on domestic abuse victim support, stress that community interventions often prove holistic, engaging multiple overlapping vulnerabilities.

The court is also aware of an ongoing multi-agency risk assessment conference (MARAC) within the Brighton area addressing repeat offenders with complex needs but limited criminal sophistication. While you are not currently subject to MAPPA or MARAC provisions, I raise these observations to highlight the challenge of balancing rehabilitation and public safety in these contexts.

It is important to reference the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as it pertains to the cross-border movement of criminals. Although no direct relevance to your case, a proportion of shoplifting offenders detected in Southern England are not British nationals. The authorities collaborate to share intelligence, yet your confirmed residence status is stable and unambiguous.

Additional Observations  
This court has noted a growing tendency among social commentators and some defence practitioners to characterise persistent acquisitive offending as a social ill born primarily of deprivation and systemic failure. To a degree, that may be accurate. But it is imperative to remember that the criminal justice system does not substitute for social services, nor does it abrogate the principle of personal responsibility.

In R v. Calderwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, the Court acknowledged the complexity of coercive control within domestic settings, and while those offences involve a very different typology, the judgment emphasises the need for tailored sentencing responses that incorporate clinical factors.

Similarly, case law concerning environmental offences, such as R v. Pendry [2017] EWCA Crim 2080, despite unconnected subject matter, provides instructive parallels on the importance of considering harm beyond immediate material loss. Persistent fly-tipping, while seemingly abstruse here, speaks to the broader impact of repeat offending on community wellbeing and public confidence.

Of interest might be observations on the limitations of digital forensic review in the context of multi-store CCTV analysis, as system failures and interoperability issues often bedevil the prosecution of retail crime. The City Technical Bureau provided valuable support in collating footage here, although the process necessitated exhaustive manual review and synchronization, underscoring the immense resource demands involved.

There have been no allegations of involvement in either affray or possession of bladed articles—offences which, though sometimes co-incident with shoplifting, are distinct both legally and factually. Your record reflects no such ancillary conduct.

I also acknowledge the court usher and support staff, who have ensured the smooth conduct of proceedings despite recent refurbishment of Court 5—the facility now equipped with enhanced audio-visual capabilities and increased public seating.

Further, this court is cognisant of the wider economic challenges faced by independent retailers, many of whom balance slim margins, rising costs, and increasing theft-related losses. The Retail Support and Recovery Network, a voluntary sector body often engaged in this jurisdiction, continues its important work in offering business resilience advice and staff training.

Sentencing Framework and Considerations  
Section 143 of the Sentencing Act 2020 delineates the criteria for sentencing in theft offences. The Sentencing Council’s Theft Guideline, issued 2019, compels courts to weigh factors encompassing the harm caused, culpability, previous convictions, and mitigating circumstances such as remorse or personal hardship.

In R v. Latimer [2021] EWCA Crim 947, an immediate custodial term was upheld for repeat shoplifting involving implemented tactics to avoid detection, underscoring the sentence range applicable to persistent, planned acquisitive offending.

However, this court must also regard the principle of proportionality and the opportunity for rehabilitation, particularly when supported by probation service assessments.

Your history discloses four prior convictions for similar offences, with one conditional discharge imposed in 2022. You are currently unemployed and reside in temporary accommodation provided through local authority arrangements.

Risk assessments suggest offending is linked to financial instability, occasional substance use, and limited social networks. There is no evidence of gang involvement or coercion, and no concerns of violent propensity.

The absence of aggravating factors such as use of threats or possession of weapons informs the overall gravity relative to other classes of offending. Nonetheless, the repetitive and organised nature of your offending cannot be ignored.

The Crown’s representations emphasise deterrence and assurance of public protection, while the defence stresses your expressed willingness to engage with support services going forward.

The court is acutely aware that such engagement has, to date, been sporadic and incomplete. The systemic frustrations facing probation and social services—reflected in national reports on staffing shortages—are compounded by non-compliance or ambivalence on the part of offenders.

There is, moreover, a need to balance compassionate recognition of hardship with the imperative of upholding law and order.

The court concludes that a community-based sentence incorporating rehabilitative elements tailored to address the criminal behaviour is most appropriate, provided such can realistically be structured to ensure compliance and reduce recidivism risk.

Final Remarks and Directions  
It is accordingly ordered that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared by the Probation Service. The report should address the feasibility of interventions incorporating cognitive-behavioural therapy targeting impulse control and acquisitive offending, rehabilitation activity requirements, financial management support, and structured accommodation advice.

Such report should also evaluate prospects for restorative justice referrals where appropriate, and any feasible unpaid work component.

I expect the Probation Officer to liaise closely with local charities engaged in your support and to consider any suitable pathways available within capacity constraints.

This court reserves final sentencing until the report is received and reviewed.
