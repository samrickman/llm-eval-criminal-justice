IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/14129  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. D. Farnsworth  
Filed: 15 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing following a conviction for theft, more specifically the systematic appropriation of goods from retail outlets without payment. These episodes fall within the ambit of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 and have been demonstrated over a course of conduct spanning several months, with offences distributed across various commercial premises within the Greater Manchester area.  

Procedural History  
Your prosecution followed what may be described as an extensive and co-ordinated effort by Greater Manchester Police in conjunction with the Manchester Retail Crime Reduction Initiative—a programme designed to identify, monitor, and accordingly disrupt patterns of shoplifting that have proven both persistent and detrimental to local businesses. This scheme relies upon inter-agency liaison, data sharing between retailers, and targeted policing strategies, and is emblematic of the attempts being made to counter the rise of low-level acquisitive crime within urban districts.  
Though such arrangements are laudable in principle, the court is mindful of the chronic undermanning and resource constraints experienced by policing teams, contact centres, and custody units alike. It is noteworthy that these stretched forces nevertheless marshalled sufficient assets to effect your arrest on 22 June 2025, after a series of electronic surveillance activities, including CCTV review and analysis of travel card usage. This demonstrates considerable operational commitment in cases of comparatively minor monetary yield, underscoring the systemic tension between finite resources and the breadth of criminality confronting local authorities.  
Informed by detailed evidential packets, inclusive of victim impact statements and technical reports, the case was advanced to this court pursuant to the Better Case Management (BCM) procedure. The BCM protocol, as established under Criminal Procedure Rules Part 3, aims to facilitate early clarity on the defendant’s stance and to expedite hearings with defined procedural timetables. This case, whilst not exemplary in its expedition, adhered broadly to the timelines envisaged, a feat not to be taken lightly given the endemic pressure on courts nationwide.   
On 14 July, you initially entered a plea of not guilty at the plea and trial preparation hearing. This position is not unusual in such matters, whereby defendants seek to challenge the prosecution’s narrative, often citing mistaken identity or lack of intent. However, following receipt of supplementary evidence—including forensic analysis of items found in your possession and additional surveillance clips—you altered your plea to guilty on 1 September 2025, just days before the scheduled trial date.  
The timeliness of guilty pleas attracts consideration in sentencing. As emphasised in R v. Simpkins [2021] EWCA Crim 928, early pleas demonstrate genuine remorse and materially save court time and witness distress. Conversely, pleas advanced only when guilt is incontrovertible warrant a more modest discount in sentence, recognising the limited procedural economy delivered. This accords also with the established principles articulated in R v. Thompson [2019] EWCA Crim 894, which delineate the gradation of credit based on the opportunity afforded to defendants to resolve matters expeditiously.

It merits recording that the legal representation you have received, through Mr Jonas Bennett of counsel, has been diligent and in accordance with professional standards. I thank Mr Bennett for his thorough submissions on your behalf, notwithstanding the constraints imposed by the paucity of Legal Aid resources. This last point cannot be overstated. The Legal Aid Agency’s notoriously labyrinthine authorisation processes caused a delay of approximately three weeks before funding for a psychiatric evaluation could be obtained. Such delays are regrettable, impeding timely justice and engendering mistrust in the system.

I must also remark upon the challenge posed by fluctuating court listings in this venue, exacerbated by recent industrial action affecting court staff. Several adjournments and reschedulings ensued, not as a consequence of either party's fault, but reflecting a broader crisis projected to impair timely access to justice if not promptly addressed. The court is, however, satisfied that these procedural vicissitudes have not prejudiced your position materially.

Turning to the matter of expert assessment, I commend the work of Dr Suzanne Archer, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose detailed report was furnished on 5 September 2025. Dr Archer’s findings are extensive and methodically presented. She concludes that, whilst you do not meet criteria for a current major mental disorder, your clinical profile reveals traits of emotionally unstable personality functioning combined with intermittent depressive episodes. Importantly, she notes a history indicative of impulsivity and poor coping strategies linked to episodes of substance misuse, though no formal substance dependency diagnosis is established.  
Dr Archer further emphasises your partial engagement with voluntary support services in the past, albeit with minimal adherence. The court observes, with some regret, that opportunities for more consistent intervention through statutory or community frameworks have been underutilised. This, of course, factors into risk assessment regarding the likelihood of reoffending and informs sentencing considerations related to rehabilitation versus incapacitation.

The Victim Impact Summary, prepared by the Manchester Retail Crime Unit on 10 August 2025, catalogues the sustained financial loss attributable to your offences—an aggregate estimated at approximately £845—as well as the concerns expressed by retail staff. These range from increased anxiety over repeat encounters with suspected offenders to adjustments in store policies, such as the installation of additional security measures and changes to working patterns intended to reduce lone working in vulnerable departments. The cumulative effect of these changes, the report notes, is a strain not only on operational budgets but also on employee wellbeing.

The multiplicity and persistence of the offences in question arguably justify a response that properly addresses both accountability and public protection aims, while also recognising the social factors that may have influenced your pathway to offending. The court must balance these sometimes competing imperatives with care and precision.

It may assist the court to situate this case within the broader legal and policy framework governing theft offences. The Theft Act 1968, as amended, continues to provide the statutory foundation, yet evolving sentencing guidelines, particularly those issued by the Sentencing Council in 2021, reflect a more nuanced approach towards repeat acquisitive offending. This includes an explicit recognition of the intersection between offending behaviour and underlying social vulnerabilities such as homelessness, mental health difficulties, and substance misuse.  
Nonetheless, the guiding principle remains the proportionality of sentence to the culpability of the offender and the harm caused to the victim or wider public. Aggravating factors may include persistence, use of deception, targeting of vulnerable victims or locations, and prior history. Mitigating considerations encompass early guilty pleas, demonstrable remorse, personal mitigation, and prospects of rehabilitation.  
In this connection, I am reminded of the case of R v. Dalton [2020] EWCA Crim 1503, where the defendant’s offending was characterised by opportunistic shoplifting across multiple locations but was found to be predominantly driven by underlying mental health issues successfully addressed on the community disposal. In contrast, R v. Carlton [2022] EWCA Crim 794 involved a defendant whose deliberate planning and use of accomplices to circumvent store security culminated in a custodial sentence, reflecting the increased culpability entailed.

It is fair to say that shoplifting, while often perceived as minor, has both immediate and longer-term deleterious effects on local economies, employment patterns, and public confidence. Small businesses are particularly vulnerable. The Court of Appeal has, on numerous occasions, recognised that sustained thefts from retail premises warrant serious consideration, not least because the victims are often the employees themselves, who may experience distress, fear, and diminished job security.  
The Manchester Retail Crime Partnership’s annual report for 2024, obtained as part of prosecution evidence, highlights a steady increase in shoplifting incidents and the corresponding rise in expenditure on security infrastructure, loss prevention, and insurance premiums. It also notes the destabilising effect on community cohesion, with some shops reducing opening hours or closing altogether due to unmitigated loss.  
It is these cumulative impacts that justify a firm but proportionate response from the courts, reflecting the need to deter offending and uphold justice for victims whilst assessing individual circumstances.

The court is also aware of the need to maintain vigilance regarding the management of cases involving co-defendants or associated parties. In this instance, no co-defendants stand charged in relation to the principal offences comprising your conviction. It is of note, however, that ancillary matters surfaced during pre-trial hearings regarding an acquaintance who faced unrelated charges of possession of a bladed article within a school car park—a fact that had no bearing on your personal culpability but affected associated proceedings. Such divergences serve as a reminder of the caution required in parsing evidential boundaries around complex cases, lest miscarriages of justice arise.  
Similarly, reference was made in the course of investigations to the landlord of your former residence having been subject to a noise abatement notice for excessive disturbance—a matter unrelated to your conduct. The court conveys no judgment on such extraneous details save to note that they fall outside proper consideration here.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Turning to ancillary procedural matters, I must record this court’s profound frustration with the delays and administrative hurdles imposed by the Legal Aid Agency in this jurisdiction. The funding application for instructing an independent forensic psychologist experienced repeated deferrals and contradictory correspondence, extending the preparatory phase by several weeks. This pattern is regrettably emblematic of a national trend, with legal practitioners citing increasing complexity and ambiguity in securing timely approvals. The result is not merely inconvenience but a potential compromise of defendants’ rights and the effective administration of justice.  
This professional disquiet has been documented in several reports commissioned by the Ministry of Justice, yet tangible improvements remain elusive. It behooves those charged with oversight to urgently review these processes and mitigate systemic bottlenecks.

The court acknowledges separately the efforts of probation officers, who bear extraordinary caseloads amidst funding constraints and staffing shortages. Your assigned officer, Ms Rachel Henderson, has submitted an initial report indicating difficulties in engaging you meaningfully within existing service frameworks. This is regrettably a recurrent theme in cases involving repeated acquisitive offending, where the intersection of socio-economic disadvantage, mental health challenges, and entrenched behavioural patterns presents a complex therapeutic milieu.  
Probation services have increasingly adopted trauma-informed approaches aiming to enhance compliance through empathetic engagement and targeted cognitive-behavioural interventions. The availability and accessibility of such services, however, remain uneven across regions.

Turning once more to the facts established at trial, CCTV footage from the retail premises in question illustrates a consistent approach in your offending. You were observed selecting items from shelves in a methodical manner, with indications of prior knowledge of store layouts and security blind spots. Use was made of common diversionary tactics, including feigning phone calls and intermittent contact with acquaintances, facilitating concealment of goods.  
The items stolen spanned personal care products, over-the-counter medications, and sundries—categories frequently noted for rapid resale or consumption. Staff reports highlighted a pattern of return visits to the same stores, contributing to a tangible sense of unease and prompting some to alter working arrangements, including avoidance of lone shifts.  
The habitual nature of these acts and your apparent complacency regarding detection reinforce the seriousness with which the court must regard this offending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

In assessing mitigation, attention is warranted to the letter you submitted to the court dated 3 September 2025. This correspondence was thoughtfully composed, articulating regret for the disruption caused and outlining personal difficulties, including recent unemployment and housing instability. The letter references past episodes of mental health hardship and acknowledges an absence of constructive engagement with available services.  
While these admissions are welcomed and carry some weight, they cannot displace the need for accountability. It is incumbent upon the individual to engage fully with rehabilitation pathways, particularly where repeated opportunities have been extended.  
The court is mindful, however, that effective intervention requires more than obligatory compliance; it demands a trust-based relationship between offender and agency, which may yet be developed.

It is essential also to place this offending within the context of wider societal patterns. We find ourselves at a juncture where shoplifting and related acquisitive crime has exhibited upward trajectories across numerous urban centres. Contributory factors include economic precarity, the erosion of traditional social supports, and evolving consumer habits. Policymakers continue to debate the best mechanisms to prevent reoffending, with some advocating for expanded use of restorative justice frameworks and others emphasising
