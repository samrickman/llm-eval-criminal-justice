IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEWISHAM  
R v. MR H  
Case No. L2025/13427  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge W. A. McBRIDE  
Filed: 13 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for a matter concerning theft from retail premises, specifically shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct charged reflects a discrete but representative count, arising principally in the Lewisham and Bromley areas over a period extending from September 2023 to February 2025. The Crown’s case has been proven beyond reasonable doubt following your pleas of guilty, albeit at a comparatively late stage in proceedings.

Procedural Overview  
The trajectory of these proceedings is illustrative of the increasing administrative complexity faced by all parties in similar cases of low-level acquisitive crime. You were first arrested on 19 February 2025 following an investigation mounted by the Lewisham Metropolitan Police Service in conjunction with the local Business Crime Partnership (BCP). This multi-agency taskforce, which brings together retail security teams, police neighbourhood officers, and council crime reduction officers, has been operative since 2017 with an aim of disrupting repeat offenders targeting high-street businesses.

Your apprehension was not spontaneous but instead the culmination of organised surveillance, including the collation of multiple incident reports, analysis of CCTV footage spanning three months, and covert operations focusing on known hotspots for shoplifting within the borough. Such investigative efforts have demanded substantial resource allocation, with officers diverted from duties concerning more serious violent crime to concentrate on a crime type sometimes dismissed as “victimless.” This court acknowledges the ongoing debate as to the proportionality of resource deployment; however, as has been consistently observed in judgments touching upon acquisitive offending, the societal harm flowing from persistent retail theft is neither trivial nor abstract.

The investigation benefited from cross-border liaising with neighbouring police units, particularly the Bromley Safer Neighbourhood Team, given the geographical dispersal of incidents. Home visits pursuant to warrant enabled the seizure of items connected to the offences and clothing matching descriptions from identification footage.

Your original charges numbered nine counts of theft, ultimately consolidated into one representative offence under the principle of efficient case management, consistent with the Criminal Procedure Rules and current Law Commission recommendations.

A plea and case management hearing was held on 24 April 2025, at which you pleaded not guilty. However, having reviewed the comprehensive evidential package—comprising CCTV, witness statements from shop assistants and store managers, and forensic linkage—you changed your plea to guilty on the first day of trial, 7 September 2025.

Such a late admission of guilt invariably attracts a constrained discount for plea, as per the established jurisprudence, including R v Thameside [2020] EWCA Crim 482 and R v Dawkins [2023] EWCA Crim 588. The court must emphasise the important principle that credit for a guilty plea is not a reward but a recognition of procedural economy and genuine remorse. Where pleas are entered at an advanced stage, after the prosecution's case has been largely established and expert witnesses prepared, the discount is necessarily limited. This approach protects the interests of victims and ensures the efficient and fair operation of the justice system.

It may be apropos here to reflect briefly upon the evolution of the Better Case Management (BCM) protocols, introduced nationally from 2018 as part of wider Criminal Procedure Rule reforms designed to expedite criminal justice processes and reduce unnecessary adjournments. The expedited processes instituted in this jurisdiction have been embraced with varying degrees of success; regrettably, repeated delays in the preparation of reports and expert evidence persist, impeding the vision of swifter justice. Yet, in this matter, coordination between the Crown, defence, and probation services was, thankfully, more effective than often observed.

It was noted with some regret that legal aid authority applications delayed the commissioning of a psychiatric report until mid-June 2025, months after initial requests were lodged by defence counsel, Mr Julian Roberts, acting under a legal aid certificate. This is emblematic of a wider systemic problem with funding authorisations, which continue to frustrate timely assessments in criminal cases involving potential mental health vulnerabilities. Such delays benefit no one and serve only to prolong uncertainty to the detriment of defendants and victims alike.

Moreover, it is pertinent to acknowledge the contribution of the Lewisham Retail Support Network, which submitted written victim impact statements on behalf of the businesses targeted. Their engagement represents a valuable link between affected proprietors and the criminal justice system, fostering understanding of the wider effects of retail crime beyond mere financial loss. It is a lamentable reality that staff working in these environments often face threats, harassment, and a growing sense of insecurity, which can lead to increased turnover and diminished service quality.

The court is also mindful of the ongoing pressures placed on the Probation Service, now operating under the National Probation Reorganisation framework following the dissolution of the Community Rehabilitation Companies. Short staffing, heavier caseloads, and limited rehabilitation resources constrain the service’s capacity to deliver bespoke interventions tailored to low-level acquisitive offenders.

I shall shortly refer to the pre-sentence report authored by Dr Amelia Kwan, Probation Service Officer, submitted in draft form ahead of today’s hearing.

Legal Framework and Precedential Context  
The Theft Act 1968 remains the foundational statute governing the offence before the court. Section 1 establishes the dishonesty element and the requisite intent to permanently deprive the owner of property. Shoplifting, while often considered minor property theft, assumes greater significance when committed persistently or involving tactics designed to evade detection, as has been demonstrated in your case.

The Sentencing Council’s definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2017) provides the framework within which the court must operate. It emphasises several key factors including the scale and frequency of offending, the nature of the stolen goods, the impact on victims, and mitigating features such as remorse and rehabilitation potential.

The appellate authorities provide additional colour, particularly the judgments of R v Falconer [2022] EWCA Crim 921 and R v Traynor [2024] EWCA Crim 107, which highlight the need for sentences to be proportionate yet deterrent in cases involving repeated targeting of vulnerable premises.

The sentencing judge must also be cognisant of the principle in R v Beasley [2019] EWCA Crim 301 regarding the application of credit for guilty plea timing, and in R v Crouch [2021] EWCA Crim 1578 on the addressing of underlying personal vulnerabilities within the sentencing framework.

While the statutory regime for community orders has evolved in recent years, the court remains committed to using custodial sentences sparingly, preferring where possible such bespoke measures as activity and requirement orders that target criminogenic needs identified in probation assessments.

Detailed Examination of the Offending Behaviour  
The facts in respect of which you have been convicted paint a picture of calculated and repetitive dishonesty. The offences were committed predominantly during weekday afternoons, often coinciding with reduced staffing or peak busy periods within shops.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

You adopted a series of concealment techniques, ranging from the use of large bags to conceal multiple items, to distracted manipulation of packaging and security tags. On several occasions, witnesses recount your calm demeanour and apparently measured manner, actions which may have been intended to create an air of legitimacy and reduce suspicion, as is common among serial shoplifters.

One store manager observed that your visits caused significant disruption to routine business, leading to financial losses not only through stolen goods but also through increased demands on staff time and the necessity of enhanced security measures.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

In a notable example, you were observed exchanging goods between concealed compartments in outerwear, demonstrating a degree of premeditation and expertise. Further CCTV evidence confirmed that after removal of items, you exited premises casually, sometimes with apparent awareness of being observed but without apparent concern.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

Staff at one pharmacy reported altered shift patterns to mitigate the risk of lone working during periods when you were most active. The cumulative emotional impact on the employees, all of whom are low-paid and often balancing multiple responsibilities, has been captured in victim impact statements submitted on record.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Additionally, your offending pattern included repeated incursions to a small independent grocery store in Catford, whose owner expressed distress at the repeated breaches of trust and the strain on a business already facing stiff competition from large chains.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Despite early intervention efforts, including a community resolution administered in late 2023 involving a restorative justice meeting, you resumed offending within a short period. This underlines difficulties in effecting behavioural change absent effective engagement with structured support.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Throughout the period in question, you were subject to informal warnings and police cautions, all of which failed to deter the conduct eventually culminating in the present prosecution.

Reports From Professional Assessors and Agencies  
The psychiatric assessment carried out by Dr Amina R. Chowdhury, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, provides crucial insights. Dr Chowdhury concludes that you present with no formal diagnosis of major mental disorder but exhibits personality traits consistent with impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. There is a mild alcohol use disorder, although this appears to be moderate and episodic rather than severely dependent in nature.

Dr Chowdhury’s report points out your limited engagement with community mental health services to date, evidencing sporadic attendance and resistance to structured therapeutic regimes. She underscores the importance of addressing underlying psychosocial issues, including social isolation and employment instability, in any attempt at effective rehabilitation.

The Probation Service report, prepared by Officer Kwan, echoes these findings and adds that the risk of reoffending remains medium, with noted factors including low pro-social attachments and ongoing financial insecurity. The report advocates consideration of a community order with substantive rehabilitative requirements, particularly an accredited thinking skills programme targeting acquisitive behaviour.

The wider landscape of statutory and voluntary support services is regrettably constrained by funding shortfalls and high demand, a reality starkly reflected in the experiences of numerous defendants in similar circumstances. The ongoing strain on NHS mental health services, coupled with the limitations of community probation resources, demands a calibrated sentencing approach that balances punitive and rehabilitative objectives.

Notably, the court has had occasion in recent months to consider the systemic impact of persistent retail crime upon public health and safety infrastructures. The diversion of policing resources in such cases, including multi-agency investigations requiring forensic analytics and prolonged surveillance, represents a tangible cost to the community. This is particularly pertinent when considering the concomitant neglect of serious offence investigations occasioned thereby.

Further context is provided by recent correspondence from the London Retail Federation addressed to this court, highlighting the cumulative economic cost of shoplifting on small independent businesses and noting a rise in closures attributed partly to repeat thefts and associated staffing pressures.

The Court’s Observations on the Wider Social and Systemic Context  
We find ourselves in a societal milieu characterised by complex, interlocking challenges. The persistent presence of homelessness and street-level begging in and around retail precincts is symptomatic of deeper social fissures. While there is no direct evidence linking your offending to such factors, the climate in which criminal behaviour occurs bears mentioning. Defendants with histories of unstable housing or precarious employment are not uncommon in such proceedings.

Moreover, the judicial system must grapple with the dual demands of accountability and compassion amid growing public scepticism about the efficacy of the courts. Disillusionment with administrative institutions, exacerbated by visible delays and procedural complexities—especially those relating to legal aid authorisations—threatens confidence in the rule of law. Yet, as this court has often remarked, the law’s authority derives not only from punishment and deterrence but also from the procedural integrity with which justice is administered.

It is also useful to reflect on the enduring relevance of certain historical precedents in the area of theft sentencing. For example, in R v. Voss [1955] 1 QB 43, the Court emphasised that the breach of trust implicit in dishonesty offences threatens the fabric of communal relations. Though the case concerned the theft of client funds by a solicitor, the principle remains salient. More recently, R v. Kennedy [2019] EWCA Crim 789 reaffirmed that repetitive non-violent offending demands a measured judicial response calibrated to disrupt persistent patterns.

Turning to the more modern jurisprudence, the Court of Appeal’s ruling in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029 dealing with a series of arson attacks highlights the marked difference in sentencing severity that arises with offences involving direct danger to life and limb. Although your conduct was non-violent, it nonetheless caused anxiety and operational disruption—a fact not to be minimised.

The court is also aware through prior judgments that co-defendants’ conduct, when unrelated to the individual now before the court, must not be conflated with personal culpability. For instance, in a separate case from the same court last year, a co-defendant facing charges for affray and assaulting police officers was found not to implicate you, notwithstanding some initial media confusion regarding names and aliases.

Finally, it is regrettable that the court’s scheduled hearing was impacted by unforeseen strike action affecting floor staff and clerical personnel, causing minor delays in listing arrangements. Such operational disruptions are part of the wider challenges faced by judicial and civic institutions, all of which endeavor to maintain the administration of justice under difficult circumstances.

Summary and Next Steps  
In light of the foregoing, this court recognises the complexity of matters attendant upon this case. While your offending falls short of violent criminality, it nonetheless represents a repeated breach of lawful conduct with real and felt consequences for individuals and businesses alike. The late guilty plea warrants some credit, albeit reduced in accordance with extant authorities.

The reports before the court underscore a moderate risk of further acquisitive offending absent effective intervention. Consequently, this court is minded to explore structured community-based rehabilitative options as an alternative to immediate custody, provided the pre-sentence report can identify a suitable framework likely to elicit compliance and reduce reoffending.

I will therefore adjourn final sentencing to receive the full probation pre-sentence report, augmented by any further psychiatric observations. That report should assess not only your personal circumstances and culpability but also the viability of a community order incorporating activity requirements, unpaid work, and access to specialist debt and substance-misuse programmes.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 13 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Lewisham Crown Court. Proceedings have been duly recorded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record will be transmitted appropriately. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.

These are the orders of the court.
