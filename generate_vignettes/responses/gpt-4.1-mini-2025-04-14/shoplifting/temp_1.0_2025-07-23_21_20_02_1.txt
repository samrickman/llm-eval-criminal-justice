IN THE CROWN COURT AT BROMLEY  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14639  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. Radcliffe  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today following your conviction for a course of conduct amounting to theft from retail establishments, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour, spanning from early 2024 until your arrest in April 2025, predominantly took place within the Bromley and adjacent boroughs’ commercial areas, targeting a variety of small to medium-sized retail outlets.

At the outset, it is incumbent upon the court to situate this matter within the broader operational and societal context in which low-level acquisitive crime takes place and is addressed by the criminal justice system. The Crown Court at Bromley, situated in the former South Thames Circuit, has long dealt with a significant volume of cases arising from retail theft and associated dishonesty offences. The case management procedures instituted here, alongside evolving sentencing standards, reflect both the gravity with which such offending is regarded and the challenges facing law enforcement and community stakeholders in addressing recurring patterns of shoplifting.

Procedural History  
Following the initial arrest of Mr H on 12 April 2025, precipitated by coordinated efforts from Bromley Borough Police’s Commercial Crime Unit and the Business Crime Reduction Scheme operating within the borough, the case was swiftly allocated to this Crown Court under the auspices of the Better Case Management (BCM) framework. The initial charge sheet specified multiple counts of shop theft, subsequently remitted to a consolidated Count 1 in the interests of efficiency and proportionality. The defence counsel, Mr Hugo Shaw, was appointed pursuant to a Legal Aid representation order, although initial administrative delays were noted in respect of the prompt commissioning of expert reports.

It warrants explicit mention, regrettably, that the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative processes have once again posed an obstacle to timely expert appointment in this case. The defence’s application to instruct a forensic psychologist with expertise in compulsive acquisitive offending was authorised only after protracted correspondence and multiple chaser communications spanning six weeks. This delay is by now emblematic of systemic strain and has tangible effects on procedural timeliness and, indeed, on the rights of the accused to a fair and expeditious hearing. Courts are increasingly exhorted to record and call attention to such administrative failings as they bear directly upon the sound administration of justice.

The BCM listing for plea and trial preparation occurred on 10 June 2025. At that stage, Mr H entered a not guilty plea. Following the Crown’s disclosure of CCTV footage, witness statements, and expert analysis of recovered property, the defence altered course with a guilty plea entered on 28 August 2025—shortly before trial listing. This timing is consistent with a prevalent pattern observed in contemporary acquisitive crime cases, wherein defendants delay admission of guilt until the evidential case is overwhelmingly established. As the Court of Appeal made clear in R v. Parnell [2023] EWCA Crim 897, such last-minute pleas attract diminished credit, reflecting both the limited procedural economy gained and the absence of early acceptance of responsibility.

It is a matter of judicial record that late guilty pleas, while welcomed in so far as they reduce trial length and witness distress, cannot be equated with those tendered promptly at the earliest opportunity. The principles set out most recently in R v. Coleman [2024] EWCA Crim 1201 reaffirm the importance of timing, sincerity, and remediating effect in assessing appropriate plea credit.

The court also records appreciation for the ongoing efforts of the Bromley Business Crime Partnership, which facilitated victim impact statements and undertook liaison with affected retailers. Given the pressure that persistent shoplifting places on local commercial operations, especially smaller independent outlets reliant on narrow margins and community loyalty, such multiagency cooperation remains pivotal in both case development and wider preventive strategies.

The victim impact material presented encapsulates the economic losses incurred, as well as intangible harms including anxiety and diminished workplace morale among staff. It also references turnover effects, whereby some proprietors have reported voluntary shortfall in opening hours to mitigate risk or an increase in temporary staff turnover attributed to workplace stress. These considerations underscore the tangible impact of what is often mischaracterised as “minor” offending.

Legal Framework and Sentencing Principles  
The criminal offence of theft, as codified in the Theft Act 1968, remains foundational in the protection of property rights. Section 1 defines the offence as dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. In cases of repeated and targeted shoplifting conducted over a protracted period, courts are enjoined to consider the cumulative effect on victims and the broader community, as elucidated in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline (2022).

The Court of Appeal’s jurisprudence provides further authoritative guidance. For example, in R v. Mercer [2020] EWCA Crim 2301, the Court upheld a custodial sentence where the defendant’s conduct demonstrated a deliberate pattern extending beyond isolated lapses, noting that repeated shoplifting undermines public confidence and burdens enforcement resources disproportionately.

Recent appellate decisions such as R v. Srinivasan [2023] EWCA Crim 409 have expanded upon the nuances of culpability where mental health issues coexist with acquisitive offending. Here, the Court balanced therapeutic needs with public protection imperatives, observing that significant psychiatric diagnoses do not automatically militate against custodial measures, particularly where there is evidence of repeated non-engagement with treatment and persistent risk of reoffending.

In contrast, the case of R v. Lewis [2021] EWCA Crim 159 considered the interplay of underlying substance misuse and theft, concluding that supportive community orders may be preferable in suitable cases but emphasising the need for meaningful rehabilitation engagement.

This court is mindful as well of the enduring tensions within sentencing policy. On one hand, the need for denunciation, deterrence and public protection remain paramount. On the other, the prospect of rehabilitation, especially where complex social factors contribute to offending, must inform proportional and constructive outcomes. Neither consideration dominates in isolation; the sentencing exercise is necessarily a balance, tailored to the individual presented.

Further, this case exemplifies the procedural evolution fostered by the BCM process. While the advantages include more structured case progression and earlier resolution opportunities, the reality remains that effective liaison between police, prosecutors, defence, and victim support agencies is variable and contingent upon resourcing and local commitment.

It must be acknowledged that community policing teams are operating under increasing strain, as reported in the Metropolitan Police Service’s recent Annual Crime Report (2025), noting rising caseloads of non-violent acquisitive offences alongside disturbances and gang-related violence. This operational context informs the court’s appreciation of the systemic pressures under which such investigations unfold.

In comparison to other offending categories, the retail theft consequent to this case, while non-violent, nonetheless exacts a heavy toll in cumulative economic loss—estimated by benchmarking studies to exceed £3.5 billion annually in the UK retail sector—and intangible effects upon consumer confidence and staff wellbeing.

The court also extends recognition to the voluntary sector organisations engaged with vulnerable individuals involved in acquisitive crime. Groups such as Bromley Outreach and Support provide vital outreach, offering assistance with housing, employment, and mental health. Their efforts are, regrettably, often constrained by short-term funding cycles and workforce shortages, yet form an indispensable component in the web of intervention.

It is well documented—though not directly material here—that many offenders in cases of shoplifting contend with multiple overlapping vulnerabilities, including but not limited to homelessness, substance dependency, and undiagnosed neurodivergence. Such intersectionality calls for nuanced assessment and appropriately calibrated community rehabilitative support, the efficacy of which remains a subject of ongoing research and policy development.

Several precedents evince the judicial challenges in balancing punitive and therapeutic responses. For instance, R v. Marshall [2022] EWCA Crim 175, involved an offender with diagnosed borderline personality disorder who committed multiple thefts and was subject to repeated bail absconds. The Court of Appeal emphasised that while mental health vulnerabilities must be accounted for, the threshold for custody remains when the public interest in containment outweighs the prospects of effective community supervision.

Equally, R v. Chambers [2019] EWCA Crim 140 highlighted that early engagement with support services can avert custodial sentences for individuals facing entrenched social adversity. The case underscores the indispensable role of multiagency cooperation and timely intervention.

Facts of the Offending  
The court now turns to the facts of the offences themselves:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

The documentation discloses a consistent modus operandi: the defendant was observed entering stores carrying only minimal personal belongings, frequently during periods of staff turnover or high footfall. Actions recorded on CCTV evidence indicate systematic concealment of goods in pockets and personal bags, occasional removal of security tags, and evasion of staff attention through a variety of concealment practices.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

At no point was violence or physical intimidation employed; however, several store employees have provided statements indicating ongoing anxiety and unease upon encountering Mr H repeatedly. One witness noted alterations to staff scheduling to mitigate solo working during the defendant’s typical time of presence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

Impact statements submitted by proprietors outline not only actual economic loss but also the cost of additional security measures installed post-offending, and the erosion of community trust which underpins small business viability.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

It has been brought to the court’s attention that despite engagement offers by local charity services specialising in debt advice and addiction management, the defendant declined participation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

Prior to the present prosecution, Mr H had been subject to an informal caution in 2023 following a similar matter; yet reoffending occurred within months—this pattern signalling a degree of resilience in offending behaviour that warrants concern.

Expert Reports and Risk Assessment  
Dr Michelle Levine, consultant forensic psychologist, produced a detailed report dated 31 August 2025. She noted that whilst the defendant does not present with a recognised major psychiatric disorder, there is evidence of impulsivity, a moderate level of substance misuse—principally alcohol—and tendencies toward self-isolation. These factors, combined with economic insecurity, may contribute to recidivism risk.

The probation service pre-sentence report, prepared by Officer Samantha Collins, provides further illumination. It acknowledges the limited social supports available to Mr H, his precarious housing situation, and a history of intermittent employment. However, it also highlights the defendant’s reluctance to engage with voluntary sector support and to take up offers of rehabilitation.

Probation officer Collins expresses cautious optimism that, with sufficient motivation and engagement, Mr H could benefit from structured community interventions incorporating cognitive behavioural techniques and financial management support.

Notably, the report comments on systemic resource constraints faced by local probation teams, who are currently managing caseloads exceeding recommended thresholds by 30%. This reality has implications for the intensity and sustainability of court-mandated supervision.

It is incumbent on this court to consider these factors and to encourage, where possible, the use of community sentences supported by appropriately resourced multidisciplinary teams.

Contextual Observations on Public Services and the Justice Process  
The pressures on criminal justice professionals dealing with acquisitive crime are evident not only locally but nationally. In parliamentary briefings earlier this year, the Justice Committee underscored the growing workload induced by low-level thefts, despite their ostensibly “minor” classification. The spotlight often falls on headline offences, yet it is these persistent, widespread misdemeanours that cumulatively sap resources and erode public confidence.

Moreover, the court hears regularly of the challenges confronting mental health services, with psychiatric waiting lists expanding and community support programmes stretched thin. The National Health Service's Mental Health Taskforce has identified critical shortages of forensic mental health workers, impacting timely assessments and interventions.

The court’s own experience with multi-agency cooperation — including liaison with adult social care, addiction services, and housing authorities — is similarly marked by resource limitations, inconsistent information flows, and fragmentation.

These realities, whilst not determinative of individual sentencing outcomes, frame the environment in which offenders, victims, and professionals alike operate. It is therefore unsurprising that rehabilitation pathways are complex and unevenly accessible.

I must also note that during the course of this case, there was an unrelated delay occasioned by a building refurbishment undertaken within the Crown Court premises, which briefly disrupted courtroom availability and required rescheduling. Such logistical considerations, while peripheral, underscore the multiplicity of factors bearing upon case timetabling.

At a professional level, the court thanks Clerk of the Court Mr David Harper and usher team for maintaining decorum notwithstanding those disruptions, as well as the Registry staff for their assistance during the evidentiary sessions.

The courtroom itself recently underwent modest refurbishment, including updated sound amplification systems, which have improved the clarity of testimony reception, an advancement welcomed by all parties.

In respect of expert witnesses, I am grateful to Dr Levine for her thorough and meticulously prepared report, and to the probation office for its balanced assessment.

Equally, thanks are due to counsel on both sides for clear and professional advocacy. Ms Harriet Chaplin, appearing for the Crown, and Mr Hugo Shaw for the defence, have demonstrated commendable diligence despite the competing pressures of a busy criminal list.

I observe, with some irony, that this case coincided with a regional strike action by court clerical staff, an event which no doubt contributed to some procedural delay. While industrial action is a lawful and vital tool for representing worker interests, it is lamentable that justice administration, and by extension defendants, victims, and witnesses, bear the brunt of disruption.

At times, one cannot help but reflect on changes in social attitudes towards crime and authority vis-à-vis prior generations. The court recalls the more deferential expectations of a few decades past; currently, there is a marked rise in public scepticism regarding legal institutions, influenced perhaps by social media narratives and eroding trust.

Such cultural shifts have substantive impact upon everything from witness willingness to come forward, through to defendant cooperation and community policing efficacy.

While these wider reflections are beyond the immediate ambit of sentencing, they offer context for understanding trends in offending patterns and judicial responses.

In the same vein, the recent Report on Retail Crime published by the National Retail Federation (2025) estimates that a vast majority of thefts now go unreported due to frustrations with the complaint process and perceptions of futility.

That phenomenon is echoed locally in Bromley, where smaller retailers express a sense of exhaustion and vulnerability.

From the victim perspective, it is acknowledged that shoplifting incidents often engender distress not only because of material loss but through perceived threats to personal safety and dignity, even absent direct violence.

The court also notes, incidentally, the unrelated enforcement action taken against the landlord of the defendant’s accommodation following noise complaints and subsequent issuance of a formal abatement notice. While entirely extraneous to Mr H’s conduct, these matters occasionally fall under the orbit of background inquiries the defence may raise.

Turning briefly to reference materials, the court has reviewed a number of case law excerpts provided by defence and prosecution, including several which, while legally apposite on principle, relate to offences markedly different in character and scale—ranging from armed robbery (R v. Simmons [2018] EWCA Crim 987) to importation of controlled substances (R v. Patel [2020] EWCA Crim 1124). Such precedents offer instructive contrasts but are not factually analogous.

It is notable, though, that even in the sphere of more calibrated sentencing, courts have maintained that repeated commissioning of comparatively “minor” offences cannot be dismissed as trivial.

The court likewise observed that a co-defendant in a recent unrelated case, charged with assault on police officers following a pub brawl involving pool cues, was sentenced only days ago in this venue. Their liability shared no connection to Mr H’s offending save for proximate listing—and the matter bears no influence here.

Further tangentially, the probity of a probation officer involved in a different breach of suspended sentence matter has been subject to internal review following allegations of misconduct; that matter remains ongoing and has no bearing on this case’s outcomes.

It suffices to say that criminal justice, in all its facets, is a field of complex interactions, some relevant, many peripheral.

In addressing you personally, Mr H, this court is conscious of the often interlocking nature of adversity — financial hardship, unstable housing, social isolation—and the degree to which these can contribute to offending behaviour. There is, however, an established line distinguishing explanation from excuse.

Your own history, including previous warnings and apparent disengagement from support avenues, weighs against leniency. Your letter to the court was thoughtfully composed, reflecting an awareness of consequences, though not accompanied by tangible efforts toward rehabilitation thus far.

Once again, I emphasise that those involved in frontline voluntary services, from charitable food banks to mental health outreach, provide essential lifelines, often under precarious financial conditions and with limited staff. Their continued commitment is commendable and represents part of the broader ecosystem intended to stem recidivism.

Summary and Conclusion  
Mr H, your offending represents a pattern of deliberate and persistent acquisitive crime, exacting real harm upon the affected retailers and their employees, as well as broader societal costs.

While your admission of guilt is duly noted, the delay in acceptance dilutes the extent of credit available.

Your personal circumstances, including financial vulnerability and housing insecurity, provide context but do not justify the persistence of your offending following prior interventions.

Given the above, and having heard all submissions, the court does not make a final determination today. Instead, consideration will be given following receipt of an updated pre-sentence report and any further representations.

This court directs that such a report explore fully the prospects of meaningful rehabilitative engagement, including the suitability of a community sentence incorporating cognitive skills development, substance misuse support, and financial management advice.

I will adjourn for sentence on 13 November 2025 to permit such assessment.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 5 at Bromley Crown Court. The record of proceedings has been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are reminded of your statutory right to appeal the sentence imposed within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.

These are the orders of the court.
