IN THE CROWN COURT AT HULL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. H2025/17509  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. G. Wainwright  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear today before this court for sentence following your plea of guilty to theft offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically relating to a series of shoplifting incidents that occurred across multiple retail establishments within the city limits of Hull and the surrounding East Riding area. Your offences span a protracted period, with the earliest occurring in late 2023 and the most recent approach in mid-2025. The cumulative effect of your conduct has necessitated detailed scrutiny, not merely because of the value of goods stolen but more significantly because of the repetitive nature of your offending and the attendant impact on victims and local commerce.

Procedural History  
You were initially arrested on 12 June 2025 after a multi-agency investigation coordinated between Hull City Police Retail Crime Unit and the regional Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP). The investigation emerged in response to escalating reports from a cluster of convenience stores within the Old Town district experiencing repeated merchandise theft. The case was subsequently allocated to the Crown Court in accordance with the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol designed to expedite complex hearings involving multi-count dishonesty offences. This court records its appreciation of the diligence of local officers, notwithstanding the well-documented pressures faced by police forces nationally—including the ongoing recruitment and retention challenges highlighted in the recent Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services report, which underscores the risk of growing caseload backlogs and investigative delays.

A series of case management hearings were scheduled on 14 July and 28 July 2025, at which time disclosure issues were robustly canvassed. Delays were occasioned by the need to obtain forensic examinations of clothing items seized during searches linked to your premises, plus collated CCTV footage from multiple retail chains. It is regrettable to note the need for extension, a feature unfortunately familiar to courts dealing with persistent acquisitive offenders. Those proceedings were attended by counsel for both parties, namely Ms Eunice Faraday for the Crown and Mr Oswald Finch for the defence. I wish to thank both for their measured, professional submissions which adhered strictly to the evidential and procedural parameters without departure into inflammatory language or unwarranted embellishment.

Earlier this year, on 25 March 2025, a panel of clinicians conducted a psychiatric assessment following a formal application made by your defence team seeking funding for expert evaluation. The Legal Aid Agency’s response was delayed substantially, only granting approval on 22 April 2025 following multiple reminders. This delay, while perhaps inevitable under current procedural constraints, again highlights systemic issues afflicting funding bodies, which regrettably cascade down to impact timely justice for all concerned parties. Your report, prepared by Dr Nadia S. Markham, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Humberside Mental Health Trust, was lodged with the court on 10 August 2025 and provides valuable insight into your mental state and potential contributory factors in your offending behaviour.

Assistance to Victims and Supporting Agencies  
The court is conscious of the toll that persistent retail theft imposes beyond the immediate financial loss. Local shop assistants, many of whom face precarious employment conditions and low wages, report increased anxiety and lowered morale following repeated victimisation. Letters from the Hull Retail Workers’ Association, dated 3 September 2025, articulate these concerns poignantly, noting that the cumulative effect of offenders such as yourself extends to forced reduction in staff hours and, in some cases, withdrawal from community engagement. This phenomenon echoes the observations made in the 2024 Annual Report from the National Retail Security Survey, which emphasises the growing burden on small and mid-sized premises grappling with ‘shrinkage’ and the ancillary consequences for neighbourhood social cohesion.

Furthermore, the court acknowledges the correspondence submitted by the Hull Safer Neighbourhoods Team—specifically a briefing note from PC Donna Carlisle, dated 12 August 2025—outlining recent efforts to liaise with businesses to manage risk and increase resilience against persistent shoplifting. These include advisory sessions on situational crime prevention strategies and the deployment of targeted patrols, albeit constrained by staffing shortages noted nationally. The court welcomes such proactive cooperation, recognising the limitations but valuing the ethos of partnership between law enforcement and commerce.

I would also like to make mention of the work undertaken by the Hull Crisis Support Network, whose outreach programmes to vulnerable persons at risk of offending or reoffending continue undeterred despite considerable funding cuts. In a letter dated 7 September 2025, the Network’s manager confirmed ongoing engagement with various community resources aimed at tackling root causes such as homelessness, substance misuse, and unemployment—factors that can, though do not inevitably, coincide with acquisitive offending patterns.

Legal Context and Precedent  
The statutory framework for theft offences, under the Theft Act 1968, section 1, stipulates that appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving them is a crime subject to a broad sentencing range. This court adheres to the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (February 2020), which directs the assessment of the offending’s seriousness by reference to harm, culpability, and the offender’s personal circumstances.

It is instructive to consider the jurisprudence that has shaped current sentencing practices. In R v. Tallis [2019] EWCA Crim 3029, the Court of Appeal highlighted that repeated shadowing of familiar targets with incremental increases in stolen value denotes elevated culpability. The repeated, deliberate targeting of community-serving shops, as opposed to larger, corporate retail chains, often magnifies the offender’s moral culpability given the disproportionate impact on local economies. Similarly, the decision in R v. Moretti [2022] EWCA Crim 411, involving a series of shoplifting offences committed by an individual with known substance dependency issues, underscored the importance of tailored sentencing that balances public protection with rehabilitative possibilities.

Further, in R v. Kearns [2017] EWCA Crim 1125, the Court reiterated principles regarding credit for guilty pleas, especially differentiating an early plea from one entered late in proceedings. Given the timing of your plea during arraignment, the court is mindful in its discretionary approach to any reduction in sentence attributable to admission of guilt.

These precedents do not reflect the totality of case law but provide a framework within which this court exercises its sentencing discretion.

The Facts of the Offending  
Having detailed procedural and situational context, I now turn to the heart of this sentencing exercise, the facts of the offending themselves. Before doing so, I observe that the case is emblematic of the contemporary challenges faced by judicial and policing agencies in managing persistent acquisitive crime, especially in economically pressured urban settings. It is to these facts that I now turn:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

Your pattern of offending involved repeated visits to the same or similarly situated retail outlets, during which you concealed goods of varying description with increasing boldness and sophistication. The stores targeted included pharmacies, convenience stores, and discount grocers, many of which cater to financially vulnerable clientele and smaller personnel rosters, thus increasing the pressure on staff.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

At times, you employed distraction techniques and altered your appearance to avoid detection, tactics that bespeak both planning and a degree of criminal sophistication unusual in shoplifting cases often viewed as spontaneous. The court notes these elements as aggravating factors consistent with the relevant sentencing guideline.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

The financial value of stolen goods, while individually modest, aggregated to a sum sufficient to impact the suppliers’ bottom lines, divert company resources to loss prevention, and undermine the consumer experience. Equally, the psychological effect on employees has been considerable: victim impact statements from several retail managers, received on 3 September 2025, recount episodes of fearful anticipation and workplace stress attributable to your conduct.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Often overlooked, these human costs bear substantial weight. The courts have repeatedly recognised the importance of staff welfare in commercial premises. The evidence before this court is that, following your conduct, several employees sought reassignment or were advised to alter working patterns. One staff member, quoted anonymously, described a palpable erosion of safety and a sense that their place of work was no longer “a secure environment for daily tasks.”

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Equally troubling is the fact that you resumed offending despite having been subject to community resolutions in 2023. Such repeated disregard for warnings and diversionary measures diminishes the credibility of claims that the conduct stems solely from current hardship or impaired judgment.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Recent correspondence from the local authority housing department, however, notes your unstable accommodation history, with multiple short-term tenancies ending abruptly. The intersection of housing precarity and offending is well documented, yet this court must caution against conflating circumstance with excuse.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

Psychiatric and Other Expert Evaluations  
Your psychiatric assessment from Dr Markham is comprehensive and offers careful observations relevant to sentence planning. The report concludes that, while you are not suffering from any severe mental illness, traits such as impulsivity and poor coping mechanisms in response to psychosocial stressors are present. These factors, the report suggests, may have contributed to your offending propensity but do not amount to a diminished responsibility defence.

The court is grateful for the clinical perspicacity which underscores the importance of tailored intervention in cases exhibiting underlying vulnerabilities. However, it must also be noted that the report identifies a lack of engagement with offerred support services, including addiction counselling and housing advice, which limits the scope for therapeutic mitigation.

I must also refer with regret to the recent evaluation from Probation Service Officer Ms Claire Stevenson, submitted 15 September 2025, which highlights chronic difficulties in securing your cooperation with community supervision. This reflects a broader challenge faced by probation teams nationally, noted in the Justice Select Committee’s 2024 review of offender management, where attrition and non-engagement rates undermine rehabilitative efforts and erode public confidence.

Societal Context and Broader Observations  
It behooves the court to reflect briefly on the social milieu in which offending of this kind occurs. Across England and Wales, shoplifting remains a prevalent concern for both retailers and wider communities. Government and law enforcement policy documents, including the 2024 National Crime Agency report on acquisitive offences, emphasise the complex interplay of economic disadvantage, addiction, and social exclusion as contributing drivers.

In cities such as Hull, shifts in industrial employment patterns combined with austerity-era welfare reforms have fostered pockets of deprivation. Charitable organisations repeatedly warn of the erosion of informal communal supports that traditionally mitigated adversity. Yet, it is also incumbent upon individuals to act within lawful parameters despite adversity—a balance the courts must navigate with care and firmness alike.

I note further the court’s awareness, through consultation with Hull Women’s Aid and Stop Homelessness Hull, that those caught within cycles of offending often face multifactorial challenges. These agencies have, in previous cases, substantially contributed to sentencing submissions advocating for integrated community-based packages. While such approaches are suitable for many, they require genuine commitment and consistency from the individual—a factor presently in question.

I pause here to acknowledge that this courtroom, refurbished at public expense last year, presents a dignified environment for the dispensation of justice. The efforts of court ushers and registry staff in maintaining order and decorum are commendable. Such details, while peripheral, form part of the institutional fabric supporting the rule of law.

Submissions  
In mitigation, Mr Finch has invited the court to consider the impact of your historical and ongoing personal difficulties, citing your history of unstable housing, limited educational attainment, and intermittent support from family members. He argues these factors reduce your moral blameworthiness and advocate for a sentence that prioritises rehabilitation over retribution.

The Crown, represented by Ms Faraday, emphasises the deterrent necessity of sentencing, particularly in light of the clear persistence and premeditation evident in your conduct. The marked effect upon victims, repeated breaches of trust, and previous opportunities afforded weigh heavily in favour of a sentence reflecting societal condemnation and public protection.

Both counsel have been courteous in their presentation, allowing the court to focus on substantive matters. The professional conduct observed throughout is welcomed.

Considerations and Sentencing Outlook  
The sentencing exercise must balance multiple factors: the need to uphold public confidence in the law’s efficacy; the recognised mitigating aspects arising from your personal circumstances and psychiatric profile; and the imperative to deliver a sentence that deters, denounces, and seeks to reduce harm.

Credit for your guilty plea, entered at the first reasonable opportunity, is appropriate but moderated by the protracted investigative timeline and the necessity of a full evidentiary process. This court notes established principles from the case of R v. Sullivan [2020] EWCA Crim 1500, which caution against generous credit where plea timing coincides with unassailable prosecution evidence.

The gravity of repeated acquisitive conduct is clear. The offences, while non-violent, represent a sustained erosion of communal trust and economic wellbeing. Deterrence, both general and specific, alongside rehabilitation and the protection of victims, must guide the court’s disposition.

Accordingly, the court regards a pre-sentence report as indispensable to a comprehensive assessment of suitable sentencing options. Such a report will consider your engagement with proposed interventions, the viability of community-based orders including rehabilitation activity requirements, and, if appropriate, custodial thresholds.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Hull. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
