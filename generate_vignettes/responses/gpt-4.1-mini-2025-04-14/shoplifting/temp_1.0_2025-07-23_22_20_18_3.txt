IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/15324  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. P. Dunlop  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear today for sentence in respect of a matter involving a representative charge of theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising from a series of retail shoplifting offences alleged and proven over a period encompassing late 2023 through to early 2025, with incidents taking place within the Manchester metropolitan area and its environs. Your case has been allocated to this Crown Court as a result of the seriousness of the offending and the cumulative effect of repeated low-level acquisitive crimes affecting local retailers.

Procedural Overview  
You were initially arrested on 16 April 2025, following an investigation coordinated by the Greater Manchester Police’s Retail Crime Unit in conjunction with the Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP) for the Manchester district. The investigation was initiated after several reports emerged of intermittent thefts from various high street retailers and independent pharmacies. The apparent escalation and consistency of the offences, coupled with the use of sophisticated concealment methods and repeated targeting of vulnerable premises, prompted a multi-agency response. This included officer surveillance, data matching of store incident reports, and labelled “Operation Stockshield.” The inquiry demanded substantial police resources over a six-week period, with detective constables, digital evidence specialists, and local authority licensing officers contributing in their respective capacities.

It must be acknowledged at the outset that the resource implications of such investigations are far from trivial. Constables and forensic teams are forced to divert attention from serious and violent crime to pursue what some may dismiss as “petty shoplifting.” Yet, these offences, when committed persistently and strategically, bear profound implications not merely for financial losses but for the social fabric, staff wellbeing, and public confidence in community safety. The reality is that retail theft represents a disproportionate burden on policing budgets and subsequent court dockets.

Your initial police interview took place at Manchester Custody Suite on 18 April 2025, conducted with you present and with legal representation pursuant to a representation order granted upon application by your solicitor, Mr D. F. Clarke. You initially maintained a denial of all involvement. However, subsequently obtained and disclosed evidence, including CCTV footage from five distinct premises and forensic samples taken from goods recovered in your possession at arrest, led to charges being preferred against you on 3 May 2025. The charges were consolidated into a single representative count for sentencing efficiency under the Better Case Management (BCM) procedural framework.

The BCM protocol, fully implemented in this court since 2023, is designed to expedite trial preparation and reduce delays. This case was listed consistently within the indicative timelines, without procedural missteps or appeals, and with minimal necessity for adjournments beyond those sought or consented to by defence counsel. Listed hearings were held on 15 June and 20 August 2025, where both prosecution and defence complied with directions to serve relevant witness statements, expert reports, and disclosure schedules. This court records its appreciation of the cooperation demonstrated by all legal teams in that regard.

The plea and trial preparation hearing of 20 August saw you, Mr H, change your entered plea to guilty on this representative count. Whilst this plea is accepted, I make preliminary observations as to the timing thereof in due course.

Noteworthy procedural points include the engagement of the Legal Aid Agency to secure funding for independent expert assessments, which regrettably endured delays of some five weeks due to administrative complexities, including changes in Legal Aid regulations on expert witness authorisations enacted earlier this year. Such bureaucratic hurdles, commonplace in many cases before this court, lead not only to frustration among practitioners but can have adverse consequences for defendants’ ability to access timely and appropriate assistance. It is so this court notes, without further elaboration, the systemic difficulties in ensuring expedient Legal Aid processing.

Additionally, the investigation and case management benefited from liaison with third sector organisations, such as Safe Streets Manchester and the Retail Support Collective, who provided victim impact statements and community insights, further contextualising the consequences of acquisitive offending in urban retail settings.

Legal Context and Relevant Authorities  
The offence of theft falls squarely within the provisions of the Theft Act 1968 section 1. The prevailing sentencing guideline on Theft (effective since 2019) prioritises the circumstances of the offence, culpability, harm caused, and mitigating factors. The time-honoured approach of sentencing for a course of criminal conduct, rather than isolated instances, remains paramount in cases like the present, permitting consideration of the sustained pattern of offending.

Although shoplifting is often viewed, sometimes mistakenly, as a low-level or victimless crime, appellate authority emphatically rejects this. In R v Thurston [2017] EWCA Crim 901, the Court of Appeal confirmed that persistent shoplifting from small businesses — particularly those serving vulnerable communities — can attract substantial custodial sentences when antecedents and harm justify. The cumulative disruption to retail viability, staff morale, and community cohesion is a factor properly weighed by any sentencing tribunal.

Moreover, the Court of Appeal’s ruling in R v Hastings [2022] EWCA Crim 329 emphasised that late guilty pleas, especially those tendered at or close to trial commencement, typically attract significant reduction in credit. Hastings serves as a reminder that the administration of justice is best served by early acceptance of responsibility, sparing witnesses and victims the distress of protracted proceedings.

The court also takes note of the guidance in R v Pritchard [2021] EWCA Crim 1104 where the Court stressed that the presence of underlying personal difficulties or vulnerabilities should be explored, but not at the expense of public protection and deterrence. Such considerations are to be taken into account alongside, not overshadowing, the necessity of clear and proportionate sanction.

To provide further context: The court recently sentenced in a matter involving deliberate environmental offences. The defendant in R v Muldoon [2024] EWCA Crim 205 dealt with fly-tipping of construction debris on protected green belt land. Although closely analogous in terms of repeated offending and public cost, the different nature of the conduct illuminates the range of harms that repeat offenders may cause. In Muldoon, serious environmental degradation and disruption to local community access justified a custodial term of 18 months, reflecting the sentencing court’s recognition that non-violent offences can have lasting and significant public impact.

Similarly, in R v Fenton [2023] EWCA Crim 678, a conviction for affray arising from a pub brawl involving the use of pool cues was upheld with a sentence of 12 months, demonstrating the variable sentencing landscape where violence and property crime intersect.

It is not lost on this court that a degree of cynicism sometimes pervades public perception of low-level crime prosecutions. There is a widespread assumption that shoplifting is a privilege of the desperate or a mere youthful lapse. That assumption fails to grasp the operational strain placed on policing, judicial, and community resources, and the real-world impact on staff who face repeated harassment and potential harm in the course of their duties.

The Facts — Nature and Circumstances of the Offending  
The facts of the offending are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

The incidents occurred in a number of retail and pharmacy outlets. They were characterised by a methodical approach in avoiding detection: use of layers of clothing, diversionary tactics, and selection of products with relatively high street resale value. Several of the venues had experienced persistent loss issues, and your actions contributed materially to what was described in victim impact statements as an erosion of business viability.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

Several store employees reported increased anxiety and diminished sense of safety, with some seeking to limit lone working and requesting additional security presence in response to your known behaviour. While no physical threats were directly made by you, the psychological toll and workplace disruption were palpable.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

The evidence indicates a deliberate exploitation of staff training limitations and store layout vulnerabilities. There is no suggestion of any spontaneous or impulsive conduct. Your actions displayed forethought and an evident disregard for the consequences upon victims and staff.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

Notably, despite alleged previously imposed community resolutions aimed at deterring further offending, your return to similar conduct within months highlights a worrying level of recidivism and suggests those interventions were, at best, ineffective.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

The cumulative nature of losses across multiple premises, while modest individually in monetary terms, aggregate to an amount exceeding £3,000. More significantly, the broader impacts extend to staff distress and a deterrent effect on retail footfall in affected areas.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Your conduct also had the unfortunate consequence of requiring additional resources from retailers, including the employment of security personnel and investment in anti-theft technologies, further amplifying the economic burden attributable to your offending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

Psychiatric and Other Expert Assessments  
The court received a comprehensive joint report prepared by Dr Imogen Banks, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, and Ms Kathleen Sinclair, Probation Officer, dated 3 September 2025. Their report considered your mental health history, personal circumstances, and responsiveness to prior interventions.

Dr Banks’ assessment concluded that you do not meet diagnostic criteria for enduring psychiatric disorder but display tendencies toward impulsivity, frustration intolerance, and some features consistent with mild adjustment disorder. There is an absence of psychosis, bipolar disorder, or significant cognitive impairment. Your engagement with psychological services has been minimal and sporadic.

Ms Sinclair’s pre-sentence report paints a picture of social instability, with frequent changes in accommodation, intermittent employment, and a noted pattern of non-engagement with community support services. Isolated alcohol misuse was identified, but without evidence of dependence. Various attempts by the probation service to offer referral to debt counselling and budgeting advice had been declined or ignored.

One must pause to reflect on the broader societal context: community and voluntary sector services designed to assist individuals facing similar difficulties exist and rely heavily on volunteer efforts and under-resourced local authority funding. Organisations such as Manchester Helping Hands and The People’s Budget Project have both submitted representations noting their challenges in meeting demand, and the regrettable phenomenon of clients who decline offers of assistance, thereby compromising rehabilitation prospects.

This court is mindful, nonetheless, that the availability of assistance does not guarantee uptake. It is incumbent upon each individual to engage with support when offered, particularly when such engagement may mitigate offending risk. The failure or refusal to avail oneself of support — while regrettable — demonstrates the limits of interventions absent motivated participation.

Background and Personal History  
You are now 34 years of age. Your criminal record includes seven previous convictions, six for offences of dishonesty, primarily shoplifting. You were convicted of similar offences in 2021, receiving a community order with a curfew condition at that time. There is no material history implicating you in violence or gang-related activity. At arraignment and in subsequent discussions, you have made various statements regarding financial hardship, unstable housing, and fractured family relationships. These are not disputed, but nor are they novel narratives.

The court further notes correspondence submitted on your behalf from the Manchester Homeless Outreach Project, dated 10 August 2025, which speaks to your housing precarity and periodic engagement with their support workers. Similarly, letters from Safe Streets Manchester reiterate a desire for rehabilitative approaches but caution that engagement must be genuine and sustained.

Recent case law instructs us that such factors are best considered within an overall analysis of culpability, risk, and the need for deterrence and public protection.

The court is, importantly, aware that you have been the subject of two separate Family Court proceedings concerning care arrangements for a dependent minor child. Those proceedings, whilst relevant to your personal circumstances, are not material to this sentencing decision and will not be further referenced.

Furthermore, the court acknowledges the unfortunate fact that your sister is presently subject to investigation on unrelated charges concerning benefit fraud, an issue that has led to familial stress but falls entirely outside the scope of the present offences.

The court also records that your previous roommate was found in possession of a controlled substance during an unrelated search in 2023, a fact that has no connection to your conduct or charges.

This case was also marked by a single, unrelated adjournment on account of the illness of an interpreter staff member, an event that was managed promptly to ensure fairness but is extraneous to the substantive issues.

Sentencing Considerations  
This is a clear instance of persistent acquisitive offending, conducted over a sustained period, involving careful planning, and impacting multiple victims. The multiple offending episodes were neither spontaneous nor opportunistic but appear to be part of an established pattern.

While the value of individual thefts may appear modest, the societal impact is significant. Small retailers frequently operate on thin margins and rely on the efforts of dedicated staff whose wellbeing is jeopardised by recurrent theft and the accompanying atmosphere of unease.

As this court has mentioned on prior occasions, the cumulative toll of low-value offences contributes materially to larger systemic strains — including the diversion of police resources, the burden on judicial administration, and the depletion of finite community and voluntary support services.

You entered a guilty plea, albeit at the plea and trial preparation stage, rather than at an earlier point. This timing necessarily restricts the extent of credit applicable in your favour, in the light of the guidance articulated by the Court of Appeal.

Your personal circumstances, including housing difficulties and episodic engagement with support, are acknowledged. Such issues are matters for appropriate consideration but do not establish grounds for undue leniency where offending persists despite prior intervention.

Pre-sentence Report and Next Steps  
I shall direct the immediate preparation of a pre-sentence report to examine all mitigating factors, your prospects for rehabilitation, and the potential for effective community-based interventions. This should include assessment of suitability for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy programmes targeting offending behaviour, financial management courses, and support addressing alcohol misuse.

The probation service will also consider the viability of a community order with rehabilitative activity requirements in the event that custody is not deemed necessary. However, the final sentencing decision will rest on a balance of personal mitigation, the need for deterrence, and harm to the victims and wider community.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 6 of the Crown Court at Manchester. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days under the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Unless otherwise directed, no reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
