IN THE CROWN COURT AT MIDLAND CITY  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. MC2025/08411  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. CAVENDISH  
Filed: 16 August 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence on a charge of theft, involving a series of shoplifting offences associated with retail outlets situated across the Greater Midland area. The offending pattern, which currently stands before the court, spans an extended period, and it is alleged to have caused disruption not only to those retail premises but also to the wider community and associated law enforcement resources.  

Before addressing the particulars of the offending behaviour and the appropriate sentencing considerations, it is necessary, as is customary in matters of this nature, to set out the procedural history and contextual background that frames these proceedings. As all practitioners appearing before the court will appreciate, shop theft — far from being a straightforward or trifling matter — increasingly reflects deeper systemic challenges faced by retail and policing sectors alike.  

Your initial appearance before the Magistrates’ Court was on 2 April 2025, following your arrest on 31 March that same year. The arrest came at the conclusion of an extensive and multi-agency operation involving officers from the Midland City Police Service, the Business Crime Partnership, and the regional CCTV unit. This was not a spur-of-the-moment apprehension, but the culmination of weeks of surveillance activity and intelligence collation. The resources deployed to monitor your movements included mobile phone data analysis authorised by judicial warrant, integration of public transport usage records pursuant to data-sharing agreements, and detailed cross-referencing of camera footage from retail security teams and municipal street installations. It bears emphasis that such investigatory activity involves considerable expenditure of public funds, both financial and human, and as such warrants careful scrutiny when the court comes to consider the proportionality and impact of the offending conduct.  

It is well understood that acquisitive crime places a distinct strain on policing capacity and retail operations alike. The constant necessity of compiling evidential packages, interviewing witnesses, and managing disclosure inevitably diverts resources that might otherwise be dedicated to the pursuit of threats to life or more serious violence. The Business Crime Partnership in Midland City, established in 2017 under collaborative funding from the City Council, Police Authority, and Private Sector contributors, proliferates its limited intelligence capacity to focus on recurrent offenders causing significant local impact. Your case formed part of the Partnership’s quarterly review report, circulated on 5 February 2025, which highlighted a concentrated presence of thefts in the retail park precinct and neighbouring high street outlets. The Partnership’s report noted concerns about rising rates of shop theft in that locality, in line with national trends documented by the Home Office Crime Data (2024). It also summarised proactive measures undertaken, including ‘Shopwatch’ alerts, retailer liaison meetings, and joint patrols by police and security staff. The efficacy of these initiatives remains variable according to the resources allocated and local uptake; nevertheless, they represent a well-meaning attempt to disrupt acquisitive criminal activity and support affected individuals and businesses.  

Despite these efforts, delays in case progression have been regrettably frequent in this jurisdiction, owing largely to multiple remand adjournments, the complexity of evidence collation across multiple premises, and the now customary challenges posed to defence instructions for expert assistance. You obtained Legal Aid at first appearance, and subsequent applications for expert assessment funding underwent protracted consideration by the Legal Aid Agency. Such delays—owing to intermittent staffing shortfalls and revised procedural guidance implemented earlier this year—have, once again, slowed case progression to a regrettable degree. Counsel for the defence rightly lamented these inefficiencies during the last listing review on 21 July 2025. It must be said, with no diminution of understanding for the constraints faced by public administration, that these administrative hurdles continue to impede a fair, timely, and effective justice process in matters of this kind.  

On 12 June 2025, you elected to enter a plea of guilty to a representative charge covering the series of thefts. This plea was tendered only after disclosure of the CCTV packages and transaction records, which strongly reinforced the Crown’s case. While the guilty plea is welcomed and noted, it is significantly later than the first reasonable opportunity afforded to you. Credit for the plea will be assessed accordingly, bearing in mind the impact of such delay on prosecutorial and judicial resources, as well as on witnesses who prepared for contested hearings.  

The court also acknowledges with appreciation the presence and conduct of defence counsel, Mr Jerome Keats, appointed via representation order. Throughout, Mr Keats has acted with diligence and professionalism, helping to navigate the procedural complexities of the case as well as ensuring appropriate scrutiny of evidential material and expert reports. The Crown is represented by Ms Amira Sanchez, whose submissions have been measured and considerate, reflecting the gravity of the offending while properly situating mitigation where relevant.  

Turning to the legal context, the court is guided primarily by the Theft Act 1968, section 1, which codifies the offence of theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. The nature of shoplifting offences, particularly when committed repeatedly over time and impacting multiple premises, is subject to sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council, as well as relevant case law.  

In R v. Stanton [2019] EWCA Crim 2647, the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial term for persistent theft offences where the defendant had targeted vulnerable premises and caused chronic disruption to local businesses. Stanton underlined that while the monetary value may be modest, the continuous and methodical nature of offending warranted particular condemnation. Similarly, the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline (2021) emphasises the importance of weighing both the harm caused to victims — including economic and psychological impacts — and the defendant’s culpability in devising and sustaining a pattern of dishonest behaviour.  

In the more recent case of R v. Thorpe [2023] EWCA Crim 491, the Court considered the role of substance misuse in sentencing shoplifting offences. While recognising addiction as a mitigating factor, Thorpe made clear that it does not automatically displace the need for deterrence where offending is repeated and defies prior interventions. This balance remains critical.  

It is further necessary to consider the procedural framework governing case management in the Crown Court, notably the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol introduced in 2018. BCM aims to streamline progression, reduce unnecessary interim hearings, and improve disclosure timeliness. In the instant matter, the initial allocation was made on 10 April 2025, with the plea and trial preparation hearing following on 25 May. Despite the best efforts of the parties, ongoing disclosure and expert instruction delays caused two remand adjournments, on 18 June and 9 July respectively. Such delays, while regrettable, occur with some frequency and reflect systemic pressures affecting the court estate and associated agencies.  

The forensic psychiatric assessment requested by the defence was eventually completed on 29 July by Dr Penelope Ward, a consultant forensic psychiatrist with the Midlands Centre for Forensic Mental Health. Dr Ward’s report thoroughly examined your mental state, history, and risk factors. Her conclusion was that while you do not meet criteria for any major mental illness, there is evidence of low-level impulsivity and signs of mild alcohol dependence. The report notes that you have previously declined engagement with community rehabilitation services and show limited insight into the consequences of your offending. Dr Ward emphasised that there is a significant risk of further acquisitive offending absent meaningful intervention.  

The report further comments upon the high operational burden suffered by probation services in the Midland region. Staffing shortages have resulted in extended waiting lists for assessment and intervention, a factor which undoubtedly impairs rehabilitation prospects for many offenders. This observation is supported by the communications from the Midlands Probation Trust, which has detailed the strain caused by increased case volumes and reduced funding over the past five years. There is a noteworthy corollary in the delayed availability of ancillary services — including substance misuse treatment and cognitive behavioural programmes — which feature heavily in post-sentence planning but are not always immediately accessible.  

In relation to the victim impact, written representations were received from several retailers affected by your conduct. These include statements from store managers at High Street Grocers Ltd, Midland Pharmacies, and the Central Retail Park security team. Common themes emerged: concerns about staff anxiety, increased security costs, disrupted stocking schedules, and reduced footfall in a previously thriving retail area. It is plainly evident that while no physical violence was occasioned, the cumulative effect on victim businesses is material. They reported that some staff requested altered working hours or redeployment to avoid contact during peak offending times.  

It is important also to acknowledge the considerable commitment made by local voluntary support organisations, including Safe Streets Initiative and Resilience Outreach Midlands. These groups provide advice, food assistance, and housing support to vulnerable individuals in need. Both wrote in support of your engagement with services, albeit noting limited take-up and sporadic attendance at group sessions. Their contributions underscore the societal context within which these offences occurred: economic instability, housing insecurity, and ongoing challenges with alcohol misuse. However, as the court has observed before in similar cases, support remains conditional upon acceptance and sustained engagement by defendants. Not every individual accepts the help put on offer, and where assistance is declined, courts must take a realistic view of risk and responsibility.  

Turning now to the facts as found. The particulars underlying this charge arise from multiple instances of theft from different stores, all within the Midland City metropolitan area, over a period running from November 2024 to March 2025. The allegations detail a consistent modus operandi involving concealment of items in personal bags, calculated timing of offences to coincide with weaker staffing patterns, and a degree of sophistication in bypassing security measures. CCTV documentation and retail staff testimony support the assertion that you entered multiple premises with the intention to appropriate goods without payment.

Despite the seemingly deliberate pattern, the court is cognisant that high degrees of organisation in theft cases may sometimes mask underlying vulnerabilities, including chaotic lifestyles and ambivalence borne of addiction. The presence of previous convictions and a history of intermittent compliance with community orders is significant but not determinative. These factors collectively present a medium to high risk of reoffending in the absence of enhanced supervision and tailored intervention.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

The court reminds itself of the principle established in R v. Duffield [2017] EWCA Crim 453, which held that community sentences may be appropriate where rehabilitation is feasible and the offending is of low to medium harm, but that repeated acquisitive crime often justifies custodial sentences where public protection is paramount. Your own criminal history, including previous conditional discharges and community resolutions relating to similar conduct, must inform the sentencing outcome here.

Several defence submissions emphasised your personal circumstances, including periods of homelessness and estrangement from family, as reported in letters from your sister, Ms Linda Graves, dated 12 July 2025, and a support worker from Midland Homeless Outreach, Mr Peter D’Silva. These letters describe periods of housing instability, occasional rough sleeping, and attempts to access temporary accommodation through local authorities. Such challenges, while real and distressing, cannot be regarded as excusing persistent offending but do contextualise the pressures impacting behaviour.

The Crown rightly invites the court to consider the cumulative impact of your offending, particularly in light of prior warnings and the relatively recent imposition of a community order in 2023 for shoplifting. The failure of earlier intervention regimes to rehabilitate is a grave concern and points to the need for a sentence that combines punitive elements with provision for effective supervision.

It is worth pausing to reflect upon the broader systemic issues this case brings into focus. The cyclical pattern of repeated acquisitive offending often exerts an outsized impact on small retail businesses operating on narrow margins and vulnerable to loss. Moreover, such offending places an undue tax on policing and probationary resources, which must be balanced against other competing priorities. It is disconcerting that, as has been observed in official Home Office reports, persistent shoplifting remains a visible and challenging element of urban criminality, frequently associated with complex social need but also with a harmful disregard for communal norms.  

The detailed pre-sentence report, compiled by Ms Fiona Kellaway, probation officer, outlines these risk factors cogently and recommends consideration of an Extended Community Order incorporating accredited cognitive skills work, substance misuse treatment, and a rehabilitation activity requirement. The report, dated 5 August 2025, notes that such interventions, if successfully engaged with, have potential to reduce the risk of re
