IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/15583  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge K. J. Morrison  
Filed: 16 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in respect of an offence of shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This court has heard evidence to the effect that the offending behaviour is not an isolated lapse but part of a protracted course of conduct affecting several retail premises across the West Midlands area over a considerable period. The chronology and pattern of events, as presented in the indictment and supporting evidence, outline a carefully orchestrated series of thefts, though of modest monetary value individually, cumulatively representing a material impact on both the businesses targeted and their employees.

Procedural Background  
The chronology of this case is characterised by a sequence of efficient listings and a measure of procedural cooperation that ought to be noted. You were arrested on 19 April 2025 after a sustained investigative effort led by the Birmingham City Police’s Business Crime Unit. The inquiry was notable for the extent of inter-agency cooperation, including evidence gathered through the operation of local CCTV networks, engagement with the retailers' shop security teams, and information sharing facilitated by the Safer Birmingham Partnership. A case management hearing was convened on 4 June 2025, at which time the court gave directions in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules aimed at ensuring timely progression towards trial or plea.  

One must acknowledge with some measure of professional gratitude that the prosecution and defence have, by and large, adhered to the timetable set at that hearing. There have been some minor delays occasioned by the need to secure legal aid funding for a psychiatric assessment which, while lamentable, are by no means unusual in cases of this nature. Indeed, the procedural history stands as a testament—albeit an all-too-rare one—to the benefits of the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol now firmly embedded in Crown Court practice. By contrast, the court has recently encountered numerous cases in which protracted delays, challenged disclosure arrangements, and late expert reports have served only to protract the period defendants and victims alike must endure.  

I must note with particular concern the administrative challenges currently faced by the Legal Aid Agency. In the present instance, applications for funding to instruct an independent clinical psychologist took in excess of six weeks to receive final approval, a delay that, while systemic, nonetheless imposes real hardship on those involved and contravenes the principle of expediency that courts and parties strive to uphold. The cumulative effect of such delays extends beyond a single case, dispersing a corrosive effect across an already overburdened criminal justice infrastructure.  

Further to this, it is appropriate to offer thanks to the prosecution counsel, Ms Sofia Green, and to Mr Daniel Hughes of counsel for the defence, both of whom have conducted themselves with professionalism and courtesy throughout these proceedings. Their submissions, albeit routine in the context of a case of this class, were delivered with clarity and respect for the rigorous application of relevant legal principles.  

Having entered a late guilty plea at the magistrates’ court on 14 August 2025, your case was committed for sentence here at Birmingham Crown Court. The timing of your plea is a factor this court will bear in mind in determining the extent of any reduction for remorse and responsibility. It is well-established that the timing, not merely the act, of pleading guilty will affect the degree of judicial credit, as elaborated in authority such as R v. Shade [2020] EWCA Crim 1127 and R v. Dixon [2021] EWCA Crim 982.  

Before setting out the particulars of the offending, I find it pertinent to reflect on the broader social context in which these offences have taken place. The pressing issues facing the retail sector in the West Midlands are well-documented: a landscape of rising costs, staffing shortages exacerbated by the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, plus the growing threat of opportunistic and repeat theft driven in part by social deprivation and economic instability. Such offences, though often dismissed as petty, have repercussions far beyond immediate financial loss. There arises a cumulative effect damaging the confidence, well-being, and morale of staff who are frequently the direct victims of these breaches of trust.  

It is also necessary to observe that the public services engaged with this case operate under considerable strain; police resources are stretched by competing priorities, shelter providers face ongoing demand fueled by a lack of affordable housing, and voluntary sector organisations endeavour to fill gaps in support with limited personnel and funding. These realities do not excuse offending but provide important contextual background when considering the sources of harm and avenues for rehabilitation.  

Legal Framework and Relevant Authority  
The offence carrying the charge before this court falls squarely within the framework established by the Theft Act 1968, section 1, which codifies the offence of theft as dishonestly appropriating property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive the owner thereof. Theft is a common but serious offence, attracting varying degrees of culpability depending on the circumstances.  

The Sentencing Council guideline for theft offences (effective from 2018, and currently under consultation for revision) provides the principal authority guiding sentences in cases such as this. It emphasises the relevance of the offender’s culpability and the harm caused, incorporating factors such as premeditation, value and vulnerability of the victim, the offence’s nature—whether opportunistic or planned—and any previous convictions.  

Notably, the Court of Appeal decision in R v. Webb [2019] EWCA Crim 1156 affirms the principle that although shoplifting might often be categorised as a lower-end offence, persistent offending and disregard for previous warnings or community resolutions may justify a custodial sentence. R v. Jennings [2021] EWCA Crim 491 reiterates the principle that the pattern and persistence of offending, rather than the value alone, define seriousness.  

Furthermore, in cases where a defendant has entered a guilty plea only after evidence is overwhelmingly established, the court’s discretion to apply full credit is necessarily circumscribed, as delineated in R v. Eaton [2022] EWCA Crim 801.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

This court proceeds from the principle that the facts of a case must be examined carefully in the context of the evidence adduced and the degree to which the culpability displayed reflects the trustworthiness and respect owed to the community and victims alike.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

In configuring an appropriate sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offence, there must be consideration both of the individual circumstances of the defendant and the wider societal interests of deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public. It is entirely appropriate to bear in mind that the impact upon small retail businesses—already struggling against rising inflation and supply chain disruptions—is particularly acute where persistent thefts erode profits and damage staff morale.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The sheer volume of time and resource expended by police and retailers to investigate these matters should not be understated. Retail theft investigations often involve extensive collation of evidence from diverse and distributed sources including CCTV, point of sale records, and witness accounts. In this instance, coordination was required across multiple corporate security teams and local policing divisions.  

It is not uncommon for cases of this nature to be delayed by challenges such as incomplete or inconsistent disclosures, demands for expert evidence—such as forensic examination of recovered goods or analysis of electronic devices—and difficulties in obtaining victim impact statements. These matters, though procedural, shape the real-world administration of justice and remain a source of ongoing judicial concern.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

In preparation for sentencing, the court has had the benefit of a comprehensive pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Ms Linda Callahan. The report provides insight into your personal circumstances, social background, and risk profile. It notes a history of both sporadic engagement with support services and a pattern of unstable housing that has involved multiple short-term stays at friends’ houses and occasional emergency accommodations. Such instability undoubtedly compounds difficulties but, as the report candidly observes, you have in the past declined several offers of assistance from local employment support schemes and mental health outreach teams.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Additionally, the court has considered the psychiatric assessment by Dr Omar Ishaq, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose helpful report referenced in detail in the pre-sentence documentation, concludes that while you do not meet criteria for a major psychiatric diagnosis, features consistent with chronic impulsivity and low mood were identified. The report further commented on your limited insight and ambivalence toward engaging with structured psychosocial support, a factor which may complicate rehabilitation prospects but can be addressed by appropriate sentence planning.  

The court takes seriously the advice of the NHS West Midlands Community Mental Health Team, which, although currently operating at reduced capacity with a waiting list extending beyond three months for new referrals, has indicated willingness to accept referrals for outpatient support in coordination with probation services. The integration of mental health and criminal justice interventions remains a significant challenge in modern practice but represents a crucial element of effective risk management.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

It is unfortunate, but not unprecedented, that you possess a history of previous convicted offences, including two community resolutions and a prior conditional discharge for similar shoplifting offences committed between 2021 and 2024. This clearly indicates a pattern of offending which has not previously been interrupted by the imposition of community-based penalties.  

The court must consider this in the light of the well-recognised principle that persistent acquisitive offending demonstrates an increased risk of recidivism unless addressed properly through interventions that target the identified criminogenic needs.  

The National Probation Service’s workload continues to increase under the weight of expanding caseloads, making timely and personalised interventions more difficult to resource. Notwithstanding, the pre-sentence report outlines a range of options which merit careful consideration, including structured day programmes and cognitive behavioural therapy specifically tailored to offenders with impulsivity and acquisitive offending.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

On a related note, the court observes with interest the evolving statutory regime concerning early release provisions and the use of Suspended Sentence Orders (SSOs) for offences of this kind. Recent modifications pursuant to the Sentencing Act 2022 have altered eligibility criteria for such orders; nevertheless, given the recurrence implied in your record, the court must weigh with particular care whether a suspended sentence would be appropriate or risks undermining the deterrent and rehabilitative objectives of sentencing.  

It is an unwelcome reality that many offenders previously managed in the community escalate to custodial sentences without effective engagement with relevant services. The court will have regard to this risk as it approaches its ultimate determination.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The wider societal context for this and similar offences cannot be overlooked. Across the West Midlands, retail crime remains a significant challenge, with rising reports of both low-level dishonesty and offences involving intimidation. The ensuing strain on police and retailer resources is palpable.  

A notable feature of modern retail crime is the emergence of opportunistic groups exploiting economic vulnerability and social dislocation. These trends contribute to a climate in which shopkeepers adopt defensive measures, from installing daunting security systems to reducing lone worker shifts and engaging private security firms at additional expense. Such adaptations ultimately drive up living costs and risk alienating communities from local commerce.  

It is worth recalling that within the ambit of acquisitive crime jurisprudence, courts, following R v. Skelton [2018] EWCA Crim 2346, have underscored that the impact upon staff welfare and community cohesion is a legitimate sentencing consideration, beyond mere financial loss.  

I remind myself and all present of the words of Lord Judge CJ in R v. Officer Wood [2009] EWCA Crim 2207, where the judiciary recognised the complex duty to balance punishment with the imperatives of rehabilitation, particularly in cases emblematic of underlying deprivation and social marginalisation. These considerations must inform but not overshadow the fundamental responsibilities of the court.  

In conclusion, it is apparent that this is a case of sustained dishonesty, marked by a susceptibility to relapse and a demonstrable disregard of earlier interventions. The offences, though not physically violent, have caused disruption and distress to staff and owners of the affected premises.  

In sentencing, this court will have to balance individual mitigation—including your personal circumstances, the psychiatric evaluation, and your late plea—with the protection of the public and the need to signal unequivocally that such conduct is unacceptable.

I reserve final sentence to allow the preparation and consideration of an updated pre-sentence report reflecting any further representations from the defendant and relevant agencies, including any new information concerning your engagement with support services or any other mitigating factors. This delay will also permit the probation service to specify precise recommendations regarding intervention programmes most suited to addressing the behaviours underlying your offending.  

The sentencing hearing will be reconvened on 14 November 2025 at 10:00 AM in Court 5 of Birmingham Crown Court.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 October 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been trans
