IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/15423  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. D. WINTHORPE  
Filed: 18 August 2025

Mr H, you appear before this court upon conviction following a guilty plea to charges relating to persistent shoplifting offences spanning the period from May 2023 through April 2025. The offending took place across multiple retail premises within the Greater Manchester metropolitan area, including both high street and suburban locations ostensibly chosen for their ease of access and, as reported, vulnerabilities in staffing arrangements.

Procedural Background  
You were initially arrested on 12 April 2025 after an investigation commenced by Greater Manchester Police in conjunction with coordination through the Manchester Retail Crime Prevention Initiative. This partnership between local policing, retail security bodies, and council community safety teams seeks to identify and disrupt repeat offending that impacts small to medium-sized business premises, especially independent outlets operating on thin margins.

The investigation drew upon several sources, including CCTV footage acquired manually from twelve separate shops, anecdotal accounts from shop floor staff, and intelligence gathered via community liaison officers tasked with both crime prevention and victim support. Additionally, the Business Crime Reduction Unit facilitated the aggregation of loss prevention data which revealed a discernible pattern bearing your likeness and modus operandi.

Crown submissions on the conduct of the investigation note the challenges inherent in prosecuting such cases. The evanescent nature of evidence in retail theft—ranging from partial video capture often hindered by blind spots, through to the limited capacity of under-resourced security teams to pursue lines of enquiry—all contribute to a process that demands considerable patience and tenacity on the part of investigators. It is a testament to the diligence of those involved that the evidence reached sufficient cogency to justify charge.

The case was brought forth under the auspices of the Criminal Procedure Rules’ Better Case Management pilot, which aims to promote earlier clarity and procedural efficiency in cases allocated to the Crown Court, especially those involving complex factual matrices with multiple victims or extensive evidential exhibits. Timely hearings were scheduled with two adjournments: first, to enable the preparation of a psychiatric report; second, owing to delays in securing expert witness funding from the Legal Aid Agency, an issue which regrettably persists despite repeated calls for reform.

In addressing the delays, it must be candidly recorded that the Legal Aid Agency’s processes in this matter were less than satisfactory. The initial application to instruct an independent forensic psychologist, made on 3 June, was approved only after protracted correspondence extending to mid-July, delaying the compilation of the expert report until late July. Such bureaucratic obstacles impact not only defendants but the efficient administration of justice, create uncertainty for legal representatives, and place pressure on court timetabling.

These proceedings have been conducted in public, as accorded by law and convention. However, it is notable that while the courtroom is open and accessible, public and media attendance remains minimal for offences perceived as “low level,” a reflection of wider societal attitudes which often fail to appreciate the cumulative impact of sustained acquisitive offending on communities, businesses, and frontline workers.

For completeness, I must also observe that the court has welcomed the continuing cooperation of the Manchester Independent Retailers Association, whose support and victim statements have been invaluable to the Crown in substantiating the material elements of the charge.

Legal Context  
The offending is charged under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, the principal statutory provision governing theft in England and Wales. Theft is defined as dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive that person of it. Shoplifting falls within this jurisdiction, and though often seen as “minor crime,” patterns of repeated offending invite more serious consideration under sentencing guidelines.

The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline for theft offences emphasises both the seriousness of persistence and the impact upon victims, including the psychological harm experienced by retail staff who face intimidation or persistent fear, notwithstanding the absence of physical violence. Aggravating factors include any prior convictions for similar conduct, targeting of vulnerable businesses, and the use of premeditation or tactical deception.

In the landscape of relevant case law, a number of authorities resonate as instructive precedents, though not without important caveats. R v. Edwards [2020] EWCA Crim 950 dealt with repeated theft targeting elderly shopkeepers, affirming a custodial sentence where prior warnings and community-based orders had failed to deter. Conversely, R v. Fisher [2018] EWCA Crim 134 provided a caution against overreliance on purely punitive measures, endorsing rehabilitation where genuine engagement and mitigating circumstances were evident.

It would be improper to overlook jurisprudence on the awarding of credit for guilty pleas. As reiterated in R v. Pennington [2024] EWCA Crim 804, credit is not an automatic entitlement but a matter of judicial discretion, sensitive to the timing of the plea, the effect on victims, and the degree to which the plea facilitates judicial economy. Late pleas, when entered only after the full weight of evidence becomes overwhelming, attract a lesser discount.

Further relevant is the evolution of Better Case Management practices, introduced pursuant to Lord Justice Moseley’s 2019 report, which sought to reduce delays in Crown Court listings and encourage earlier cooperation between parties. While this framework has arguably improved process flow in many arenas, resource constraints in prosecution and defence contexts often limit its full efficacy.

This court must also balance those principles with the pragmatic reality of public services under considerable strain. The probation service faces a notable shortfall in officers qualified to undertake complex risk assessment, further complicated by burgeoning caseloads related to housing instability, substance misuse, and mental health challenges. These intersect with legal proceedings in unpredictable ways.

In framing these sentencing remarks, it is prudent to recall that while the court must hold offenders accountable, it is also tasked with promoting rehabilitation where appropriate and safeguarding society as whole. The dual imperatives of justice and mercy navigate a delicate course.

Before outlining the facts of offending, I consider it necessary to make reference to pertinent auxiliary matters outside the immediate conduct alleged, to provide a comprehensive contextual framework.

The defendant’s prior record, while limited in scope, includes a conditional discharge imposed in 2021 following a community resolution relating to the theft of electronics from a private dwelling during the defendant’s absence of residence. Though of a different category, this matter evidently placed Mr H on formal notice. There is no indication of subsequent involvement in violent crime, drug supply, or trafficking offences.

Separate GPS data recovered during the extensive multi-agency investigation—which involved close cooperation between the Greater Manchester Police Digital Forensics Unit and the North West Regional Crime Analysis Team—showed no locational links to several incidents of copper cabling theft from a rail depot occurring contemporaneously in the wider borough. These unrelated offences remain under inquiry, with at least one co-defendant currently at large.

Statements from acquaintances confirm that Mr H does not belong to any gang or organised crime unit, nor has he been linked to affray or assaults on law enforcement personnel during arrest, with no reports of possession of bladed articles or offensive weapons on his person. There is, however, reference in police notebooks to a recent noise abatement notice served on the landlord of Mr H’s current council-provided accommodation, though it is unclear whether this impacted his housing stability.

The facts of the case are as follows:

Further to these facts, it is recorded that the defendant’s modus operandi involved returning to previously targeted stores despite warnings, and using concealment tactics such as stuffed pockets and bags left deliberately open to misdirect security personnel. Several witnesses described feeling “uneasy” in Mr H’s presence, though no physical threats were made.

The pattern of offending caused material loss averaging approximately £15 per incident, but carries an outsized psychological toll for staff, with job satisfaction and morale evidently reduced by the persistent fear of confrontation or false accusations.

Though the Crown has not alleged violence, evidence confirms that attempts to engage shop assistants in conversation were sometimes brusque or insincere, clearly aimed at distraction rather than dialogue.

Notably, Mr H has not responded positively to offers of assistance made through community liaison officers, including proposals for referral to budgeting advice programs or local employment schemes run by the City of Manchester Council.

Victim impact statements, collected in collaboration with the Manchester Safety Net charity, articulate the financial losses incurred plus incidental costs arising from increased security measures such as additional CCTV installation and staff training.

The Crown further submits that despite previous warnings and a conditional discharge, the defendant persisted in offending—consistent with a lack of contrition until the present proceedings rendered denial untenable.

Expert Assessments  
I have received and carefully considered the report of Dr Fiona Leeming, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, instructed to undertake a detailed assessment of Mr H’s mental health and risk factors. Dr Leeming’s report was comprehensive, including a clinical interview, review of medical history, and collateral discussions with relevant care providers.

The report concludes that Mr H does not meet criteria for any major psychiatric diagnosis such as psychosis or mood disorder. However, it observes elevated levels of impulsivity, traits consistent with borderline personality disposition, and intermittent use of alcohol to self-medicate stress. There is no evidence of cognitive impairment or diminished responsibility.

Dr Leeming highlights a marked ambivalence towards engagement with statutory or voluntary services, noting that the defendant declined invitations for financial counselling or NHS primary mental health support. Risk of reoffending is assessed as moderate, with low immediate risk to others but a clear potential for future acquisitive offences absent intervention.

A pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Ms Yasmin Cullen noted the prevailing pressures faced by Greater Manchester Probation Trust. These include high caseload volumes and recruitment challenges, which contribute to delays in report preparation. Despite limited interview time, Ms Cullen provided a thorough overview of the defendant’s personal circumstances, including unstable housing, unemployment, and family estrangement. She emphasises the necessity for targeted supervision focusing on skill-building and attendance at debt management workshops.

I echo the observations in relation to the demands placed on voluntary sector providers, particularly in areas of drug and alcohol misuse support, where waiting times for NHS funded clinics currently exceed six months. Initiatives such as the Manchester Community Link Network continue to offer invaluable face-to-face interventions but operate on constrained budgets and volunteer staffing.

The court is also mindful of the strain reported within local policing due to increasing volumes of non-serious acquisitive crimes. This has led to prioritisation strategies that limit proactive engagement with minor offences, necessitating a focus on repeat offenders such as yourself.

Community and Charitable Sector Correspondence  
Letters submitted from the Manchester Food Hub and Salford Homeless Support additionally illustrate the precariousness of Mr H’s socioeconomic situation. The writers commend his prior intermittent participation in support groups but lament the absence of sustained commitment.

A representation from the defendant’s sister sketched a familial context characterised by fractured relationships and limited support networks, which, while evocative, do not negate personal responsibility. The court acknowledges this background but cautions against conflating adversity with exemption from legal accountability.

Turning to a separate matter, it is worth noting briefly that the co-defendant in an unrelated case involving the possession of indecent images on digital devices in Stockport would be subject to distinct legal proceedings and considerations. Such matters bear no relevance or prejudice here and should be distinguished accordingly.

Sentencing Considerations  
It is apparent that the offending before this court, while classified as “shoplifting,” must be viewed in light of its cumulative nature and attendant impact on individual victims and the community. The failure to desist—despite prior interventions—reflects a troubling pattern.

Mitigating circumstances include your guilty plea, albeit late, and the absence of prior violent or drug-related offending. The reports suggest potential benefits from community-based rehabilitation if correctly tailored and rigorously monitored.

Aggravating features consist primarily of repeat conduct, failure to engage with support, and the clear detrimental effect on retail employees’ wellbeing and business viability.

This court draws upon the principles articulated in R v. Milton [2019] EWCA Crim 722, where the Court underscored the necessity of an approach balancing deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection in acquisitive crime. The court also notes guidance from the Sentencing Council’s theft guidelines (2022), which counsel tailored interventions focused on the specific offending behaviour rather than broad generalisation.

Given these considerations, I propose to adjourn sentencing pending receipt of an updated pre-sentence report exploring feasible options for engagement with offender rehabilitation programmes.

The court is confident that with appropriate intervention, including cognitive behavioural therapy focusing on impulsivity and financial management support, the risks of reoffending may be mitigated consistent with statutory purposes.

These sentencing remarks are issued on this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 at Manchester Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed as per Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules and a formal transcript duly recorded. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal within 28 days of sentence under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in these proceedings. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
