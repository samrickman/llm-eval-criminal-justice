IN THE CROWN COURT AT BURY SAINT EDMUNDS  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13857  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. A. FAIRFAX  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced in relation to an offence of theft, specifically shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The prosecution case concerns conduct spanning various retail outlets within the Suffolk and Norfolk counties over a period traversing late 2023 into early 2025. The volume and frequency of offending, while involving low individual item values, cumulatively reflect a course of conduct which the court is obliged to consider with due seriousness.  

Procedural History  
Your apprehension followed a drawn-out inquiry initiated by local Trading Standards and neighbourhood policing teams, working in close cooperation with the Eastern Business Crime Forum. This partnership—a coalition of retail management, police officers, council enforcement representatives, and voluntary sector outreach coordinators—sought to coordinate a tactical response to the apparent rise of repeat theft from small-to-medium retail operations in the market towns within the region. The Business Crime Reduction Partnership structure, as it is widely known, aims to collate intelligence swiftly, share it among partners, and intercept persistent offenders proactively. Its effectiveness, however, frequently depends not only on the quality of information obtained but also on the availability of resources and the stability of inter-agency relationships—variables which vary starkly from one locality to another.   

Although the concept of intelligence-led policing and coordinated retail response is well-established, this case exemplifies many of the operational difficulties now endemic within such frameworks. Staffing shortages caused by recruitment challenges, budgetary limitations constraining surveillance capacity, and the competing demands of other priorities such as violent crime investigations have long been acknowledged. Indeed, recent reports by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services have highlighted the strain imposed by what might be termed “persistent but low priority” offences on local tasking arrangements. Particularly acute is the burden placed on police Community Support Officers and police volunteers, whose valued but limited time is often absorbed by administrative follow-up rather than frontline crime prevention.   

The initial identification of a suspect matching your description occurred in mid-December 2024, following anonymised analyses of CCTV footage submitted by participating stores together with coordinated review of local licensing and street CCTV in the vicinity of multiple town centres. Such surveillance technologies, while indispensable, do not create evidence in and of themselves. Instead, they serve as an enabling tool that must be supplemented by meticulous review, corroborated witness testimony, and, in some instances, forensic trace examination. The legitimacy and proportionality of data usage are, of course, strictly regulated under the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice and the Data Protection Act 2018. As with any investigatory method, ongoing audits ensure compliance and protect individual rights.  

A pre-trial hearing was conducted on 22 July 2025, at which time your defence first applied for the instruction of an independent psychiatric expert under section 153 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The request—which sought to explore underlying issues that might inform sentencing—was initially delayed due to administrative backlogs at the Legal Aid Agency, particularly relating to the processing of extended representation orders for expert witnesses. Similar delays in expert commissioning have been noted in the recent Criminal Bar Association Annual Report 2025, which attributed some such withholding to rising case numbers and constrained budgets across the statutory framework supporting court proceedings. I must acknowledge both your defence counsel, Mr Jamie Clifford, for his persistence in securing timely funding approval, and the Crown prosecutor, Ms Rhoda Jarvis, for her assistance in consenting to the adjournment necessitated by this process.  

On 10 August 2025, Dr Holly Marchand, consultant forensic psychiatrist, submitted her assessment report. The report—comprehensive, detailed, and professionally composed—concludes that there is no diagnosable major mental disorder impairing your criminal responsibility, but observes traits consistent with intermittent impulse control difficulties and mild depressive symptoms, though these were not found to diminish culpability. Her recommendations include engagement with community mental health services to address emotional regulation and support reintegration. The report further advises a cautious approach to any custodial sentence, favouring structured rehabilitation where possible. The psychiatric evidence was subsequently discussed at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 4 September 2025, where you confirmed your intention to plead guilty, albeit belatedly.  

Late guilty pleas, as your counsel is doubtless aware, invoke the principles articulated in R v. Stewart [2020] EWCA Crim 1234, which affirmed that reductions in sentence for guilty pleas depend not solely on the plea's existence but upon its timing and the motivation behind it. The courts remain mindful that early admissions conserve public resources, spare victims and witnesses unnecessary distress, and indicate genuine remorse. Conversely, delayed pleas, entered only once the case is effectively uncontested, warrant more limited credit. This principle is echoed in the observations of R v. Pargeter [2021] EWCA Crim 569, where the Court underscored that tactical pleas—those entered mainly to gain procedural advantage—cannot be equated with genuine contrition. I remind all in attendance that such standards are not arbitrary but serve both the interests of justice and the wellbeing of those materially affected by crime.   

Aside from the immediate procedural narrative, it is worth noting, though with no particular relevance to your conduct, that one co-defendant in a separate but related business theft investigation presently remains at large following recent breaches of bail conditions. Their charges include possession of a bladed article in a restricted area, an offence that does not pertain to you but has delayed administrative resolution of overlapping trial scheduling. This underscores the sometimes intricate interplay of allied investigations and the resultant cascading effects on court listing.   

It was necessary also to adjourn the matter temporarily to allow the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report by probation services, to inform an appropriate sentence given the intertwined concerns of offending pattern, personal circumstances, and rehabilitative potential. The Probation Service currently faces substantial caseload pressures, with particular challenges in managing community orders amid recruitment shortfalls and increased demand for specialist mental health interventions. The report, delivered on 15 September 2025, highlights issues with housing instability, previous non-compliance with voluntary sector support, and limited engagement with substance misuse programmes. It records instances of your reluctance to sustain contact with officers and volunteers, though it cautiously notes some recent willingness to attend voluntary appointments. These observations are important in framing the sentencing options.  

I should perhaps take a moment to acknowledge the enduring efforts of the Suffolk Retail Fightback Network, a coalition of local store owners who, despite dwindling revenues and persistent security concerns, remain committed to supporting the investigatory process and providing victim impact statements. Their representatives stressed particularly the increased anxiety among shop staff, altered rota patterns, and the resultant diminution in community accessibility in affected premises. These accounts, while commonplace in shoplifting cases, are not to be minimised. Nor are the contributions of CrisisPath, a local charity offering housing and financial advice, which has submitted material on your behalf advocating a constructive sentencing approach to support reintegration and discourage further offending. Such partnership approaches represent a model of civic engagement that courts warmly endorse.  

Beyond the statutory framework and reports, it is worth reflecting on the wider social environment in which retail theft occurs. Recent Home Office crime statistics reveal a sector-wide rise in the incidences of acquisitive crime during the post-pandemic period, reflecting a combination of economic insecurity, shifts in policing priorities, and broader societal stressors. The pressures on frontline retail staff have similarly intensified, with documented increases in workplace abuse and stress-related absences. While these trends contextualise offending, they do not excuse it; instead, they highlight the imperative for proportionate but firm judicial responses allied with suitable rehabilitative measures.  

The law, as codified in the Theft Act 1968, stipulates the fundamental parameters for the offence of theft: dishonesty with intent to permanently deprive. The bedrock principles remain unchanged since the Act’s inception, though successive amendments and judicial interpretations have refined application. The Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Definitive Guideline, updated in 2023, sets out an approach that balances culpability and harm, reflecting factors such as value, vulnerability, and persistence. The relevant guidance encourages custodial sentences only where offending demonstrates significant planning, breaches of trust, or occurrence in sensitive settings. Community sentences remain the starting point for most low-level theft, save where mitigating and aggravating circumstances dictate otherwise.  

The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Donoghue [2022] EWCA Crim 1739 provides a recent example where cumulative offending with disregard for prior warnings warranted an immediate custodial term. In that case, the defendant had repeatedly targeted independent convenience stores, causing measured but enduring distress. The court rejected arguments for suspended sentences, underscoring the deterrent imperative. Though your case is distinguishable in terms of scale and context, principles of deterrence, protection of retail staff, and prevention of further offending are equally applicable.  

Of academic interest but no immediate bearing here, the case of R v. Templeton [2019] EWCA Crim 554 raised issues around sentencing for theft occurring during periods of sleep deprivation and medication side effects in the context of severe chronic illness. Though shown to offer little mitigating value in that instance, the judgment is instructive in mapping evidential thresholds required for mental health considerations. Similarly, R v. Stanwick [2018] EWCA Crim 681 emphasised that absence of violence and low financial loss do not necessarily constrain sentence length where community impact and persistence are significant.  

Facts of the Offending  
The facts, as established through evidence admitted and agreed, reflect a pattern of opportunistic theft targeting predominantly small retail stores in market towns including Bury Saint Edmunds, Newmarket, and Thetford. Surveillance footage, witness testimony, and recovered property collectively underpin the prosecution’s case.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

The incidents occurred typically during late-morning or early-afternoon periods when shops were busy but staff numbers reduced. You were observed using distraction methods, including engaging staff in conversation while concealing items, and employing bulky clothing to obscure specially targeted goods.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

On several occasions, you entered stores carrying open bags or backpacks, allowing you to conceal stolen goods discreetly. Staff recollections include your calm, unhurried demeanour, which, while not aggressive, evidently facilitated your activities. Behaviour of this nature is neither spontaneous nor accidental; it indicates familiarity with retail environments and an intention to exploit routine vulnerabilities.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

The stolen items principally comprised over-the-counter cosmetics, small electronic accessories such as earphones, and boxed confectionery. Many items bear unmistakable markings of prior theft, having been returned to sale via secondary markets, though the precise financial impact on individual stores remains low in absolute terms. Nonetheless, the cumulative harm is measurable.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

Many staff members interviewed expressed feelings of unsettledness and decreased morale. One manager recounted how shop floor layouts were altered to reduce concealment opportunities, resulting in practical inconveniences to both employees and customers alike. Logistic adjustments also resulted in increased workloads and scheduling adjustments to reduce lone working, in line with safeguarding recommendations.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Although no threats or violence were employed or alleged, the psychological impact on shop assistants was accentuated by the recurring nature of the offences. This is consistent with findings in the Retail Crime Impact Study published in 2023 by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, which notes that even non-violent theft can precipitate elevated workplace anxiety and adverse staff retention outcomes.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Your prior record, though limited, includes two convictions for theft-related offences in 2020, both resulting in community resolutions and cautioning. Despite these interventions, similar behaviour has continued, indicating a degree of recidivism and limited responsiveness to prior warnings.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Correspondence from the local Council Housing Authority, provided in support of your defence, confirms a history of unstable tenancy arrangements with multiple short-term placements. While housing insecurity undoubtedly poses challenges, it is not a shield against accountability.

Expert Report and Risk Assessment  
Dr Marchand’s psychiatric evaluation, supplemented by the probation assessment, highlights a profile characterised by moderate impulsivity and fluctuating engagement with social support services. Neither report suggests major psychiatric impairment but notes the absence of sustained treatment for underlying emotional difficulties.  

The probation service’s assessment points to an intermediate risk of reoffending based on demonstrated non-compliance and situational factors including financial insecurity and social isolation. It also emphasises the potential value of structured cognitive-behavioural programmes to address the offending pattern. However, there is some reservation expressed about your prior unwillingness to engage fully with voluntary support schemes.

The court is mindful of the commendable, if overstretched, efforts of local voluntary agencies seeking to provide rehabilitative opportunities to offenders presenting with similar profiles. These organisations often operate under acute financial and staffing constraints, necessitating prioritisation of cases and a delicate balance between support and enforcement. That you have so far declined to sustain meaningful contact with such bodies remains a significant consideration in framing sentencing options.

Further Observations and Contextual Remarks  
The court is conscious of the evolving nature of acquisitive crime enforcement, shaped by the Better Case Management (BCM) protocols introduced in recent years. These reforms have sought to improve case progression timeliness and reduce unnecessary adjournments, with mixed success. In this matter, the cooperation between prosecution and defence counsel, court staff, and investigative agencies has been generally constructive, notwithstanding delays caused by Legal Aid processing and the necessity to obtain expert assessments.

It should be noted that, in the broader criminal justice environment, staff shortages have impacted the Probation Service’s capacity to supervise and support persons subject to community orders—a trend documented in the National Probation Service Annual Review 2024. Such capacity constraints invariably influence sentencing decisions, underscoring the need for both discretion and evidence-informed judgment.

The court’s experience with cases involving persistent shoplifting offences confirms the importance of a measured approach balancing punitive and rehabilitative objectives. Offenders such as yourself often present with complex risk and need profiles, compounded by socioeconomic disadvantage and, at times, mental health challenges. It is incumbent upon the court to ensure that any sentence reflects public protection priorities while also facilitating opportunities for change and desistance.

Counsel Submissions  
Ms Jarvis, appearing for the Crown, emphasised the repeated and deliberate nature of your offending, the impact on retail workers, and the failure to respond to prior informal interventions. She invited the court to consider an immediate custodial sentence, tempered by the psychiatric evidence, as an appropriate vehicle to signal deterrence and uphold community confidence.

Mr Clifford, representing you, submitted that your early history and personal circumstances warrant mitigation. He pointed to the expert’s recommendation for community intervention, the absence of violence, and your eventual guilty plea, interpreting it as a sign of emerging responsibility. He urged the court to impose a community order with tailored rehabilitation and unpaid work requirements rather than custody.

These competing submissions have been fully considered and weighed within the framework of sentencing principles.

Closing Remarks  
Having considered the procedural history, the pre-sentence and psychiatric reports, the statutory and guideline provisions, the submissions of counsel, and the totality of circumstances known to me, I do not propose to announce sentence today. The difficulty in securing robust and timely interventions suitable to your profile, alongside your history of limited engagement, means that a detailed pre-sentence report remains essential to informed decision-making.

The court will therefore adjourn sentencing to the earliest convenient date following receipt of any further updated reports or representations, at which point I will impose sentence.

I record my thanks to Ms Jarvis and Mr Clifford for their professional and thorough advocacy. I also thank court staff for their assistance in managing case flow and the retention of order. The courtroom facilities have recently been refurbished, featuring upgraded digital display systems to aid evidence presentation—although, on occasion, intermittent connectivity remains a source of frustration for practitioners and judicial officers alike.

As this hearing concludes, I remind you, Mr H, that you have the right to appeal the sentence imposed once it is passed. Any notice of appeal must be lodged within 28 days of sentencing. Unless otherwise directed, no reporting restrictions are engaged in respect of this matter.

These sentencing remarks are issued today, on 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at Bury Saint Edmunds Crown Court. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant registries and supervisory agencies, and all appropriate notifications made in due course.

These are the orders of the court.
