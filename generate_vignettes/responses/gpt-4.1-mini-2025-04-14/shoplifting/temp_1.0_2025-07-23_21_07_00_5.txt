IN THE CROWN COURT AT FINSBURY PARK  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/15123  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge C. J. MONTGOMERY  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence in respect of an offence of theft, specifically shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The circumstances giving rise to this prosecution relate to multiple incidents occurring over a sustained period from late 2023 to early 2025 within the bounds of the Finsbury Park and adjacent boroughs’ commercial districts.

Procedural Overview  
Your arrest followed an intelligence-led operation conducted by officers from the Metropolitan Police Service, in partnership with the Finsbury Park Business Crime Reduction Partnership and Safer Neighbourhood Task Force. This investigation was notified initially through reports from a number of independent and chain retail outlets in the area, noting a pattern of repeated thefts affecting a range of product categories. The coordination of information sharing between store operators, loss prevention teams, police analysts, and community safety officers was overseen through the Business Crime Reduction Partnership’s weekly meeting forum.  

It is, regrettably, emblematic of these proceedings that such multi-agency collaborations, while conceptually effective, are often challenged by workforce shortages, competing priorities, and the administrative overhead of collating data and producing actionable intelligence. The present case, however, proceeded with relative procedural efficiency, albeit with the unfortunate delay occasioned by challenges in securing forensic analysis funding via the Legal Aid Agency, as will be further developed.

A hearing was convened on 21 June 2025 for plea and trial preparation, held in accordance with the Better Case Management (BCM) protocols established under the Criminal Procedure Rules. As is customary, the aim of BCM is to ensure timely resolution, early engagement with evidence disclosure, and preparation for trial where necessary. You initially entered a plea of not guilty at that hearing, prompting further witness statements and evidential gathering by the Crown.

It is a familiar frustration that defendants sometimes opt to contest charges only to later revoke that stance, often at an advanced stage and after considerable expense and inconvenience to witnesses, court resources, and prosecuting authorities. While every individual retains the right to a fair contest, this court reminds, as in R v Foster [2020] EWCA Crim 1023, that late pleas may attract a reduced credit discount.

Notwithstanding these dynamics, the case was listed for sentence upon your admission of guilt entered on 24 September 2025. Despite the late nature of your plea, it is incumbent upon the court to assess your conduct in its entirety and calibrate an appropriate response that reflects the gravity of the offending and the requirements of public protection.

I further note the assistance rendered by Ms Helen Bishop, representing the Crown, and Mr Mark Ellis, instructed on your behalf under a Legal Aid funding order. The court reluctantly records the protracted delays occasioned by Legal Aid authorisation processes, including deferred approval for instructing a forensic psychologist, which required multiple applications and consequent adjournments. The Legal Aid Agency remains, insofar as this court can observe from repeated cases, an institution whose procedural inefficiencies practically undermine the principle of timely justice.

An overview of the incident reporting indicates a steady pattern of acquisition of low-value goods from convenience stores and pharmacies, with repeated breaches notwithstanding prior cautions and diversion attempts. The financial impact on small businesses — already navigating a difficult post-pandemic retail environment marked by staff shortages and supply chain disruption — is not merely monetary but also emotional, attributable to insecurity and repeated victimisation.

The statutory framework applicable contemplates a responsive but proportionate exercise of sentencing discretion. Whilst certain offences, predominantly those involving violence or significant financial loss, attract custodial sentences as norm, it is nevertheless recognised that acquisitive crime, particularly persistent offences involving vulnerable premises, can warrant similar gravity.

I shall now deal with relevant and instructive case law that informs the tariff and sentencing principles in shoplifting and related theft offences. Reference is made to the sentencing guideline issued by the Sentencing Council in 2021 regarding theft offences, which highlights aggravating factors including repeat offending, targeting of vulnerable victims, and impact upon business viability.

In R v. Bartley [2019] EWCA Crim 1543, the appellant was convicted of a series of thefts from supermarkets, with the Court affirming the sentencing judge's discretion to impose immediate custody where persistent offending evidences disregard for prior warnings and community sanctions. Bartley reasserts the principle that accumulated harm, while perhaps fragmented into lesser discrete offending episodes, is to be aggregated in sentencing consideration.

I also find the reasoning in R v. Plummer [2022] EWCA Crim 991 salient. This case involved theft from pharmacies and community-run outlets by a defendant motivated by substance dependency. Notwithstanding empathy for the underlying vulnerabilities, the Court reaffirmed the primacy of deterrence and public protection, noting that mitigation arising from personal circumstances must be weighed against the demonstrable impact upon vulnerable businesses.

The court also acknowledges the guidance in R v. Wells [2018] EWCA Crim 1331, a matter examining the principles governing credit for guilty plea timing. Wells underscores that credit is contingent not only on admission but on the promptness and sincerity thereof and cautions against “strategic” last-minute pleas.

The court further notes the precedence in R v. Lyons [2017] EWCA Crim 1145 concerning the use of surveillance and forensic matching in securing conviction in shoplifting cases. Lyons affirmed that whilst evidential proofs may often be circumstantial or dependent on technology, the corroborative effect can suffice to satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt.

It is appropriate to acknowledge the victim impact dimension, including statements gathered from staff employed in affected stores. They describe persistent anxiety, a reluctance to work alone at times, and, in some cases, changes to work rotas to mitigate risk. While no physical assault or threats were reported, the psychological toll is non-negligible, emblematic of the “quiet harm” frequently dismissed in cases that appear, superficially, of low severity.  

The court also notes commentary from the Voluntary Retail Support Network (VRSN), whose caseworkers engage with affected proprietors. Their correspondence highlights a longstanding problem: despite commendable preventative measures, resource constraints hamper their ability to offer bespoke advice or coordinate follow-up support consistently.

Turning to expert assessments, I have considered with care the psychiatric report prepared by Dr Amina Qureshi, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, instructed pursuant to the court’s directions. Dr Qureshi’s findings are nuanced. While she does not diagnose a major mental disorder, she observes clinically significant impulsivity coupled with low frustration tolerance and intermittent depressive symptoms. The report cautions, however, that these traits, though contributory, do not constitute a defence nor fully explain offending behaviour.  

This illustrates a recurring theme: a standard psychiatric profile associated with certain disinhibitory tendencies may be present, yet the court must balance therapeutic aspirations against the imperative of safeguarding the public and deterring reoffending. As R v Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624 elaborated, mental health considerations are relevant but do not negate custodial sentences where risk is present.

Further, I observe the difficulties that the NHS faces in providing timely community mental health services. Waiting lists and funding shortfalls delay intervention, but this cannot absolve individual accountability where deliberate criminal choices are made in the interim.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

The probation officer’s pre-sentence report paints a portrait of an individual with unstable accommodation, limited family support, and erratic engagement with prior community disposals. The report recommends consideration of a community order incorporating a Requirement for Rehabilitation Activity, with particular reference to cognitive behavioural interventions targeting acquisitive offending and impulse control.

It must be remarked that the probation service continues to endure significant caseload pressures resulting from widespread administrative reform and funding reductions. Effective supervision is consequently challenged, undermining opportunities for sustained rehabilitation. The court notes this systemic strain with regret.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

The submissions made by defence counsel emphasise your acceptance of responsibility, expressed remorse, and commitment to engage rehabilitation services post-sentence. These are relevant factors but must be coupled with acknowledgement of the cumulative societal harms that persistent thefts cause.

From the Crown, Ms Bishop submitted that, notwithstanding your plea, a custodial sentence is merited given the repeated nature of the offending, the impact on victims, and previous failed interventions. The Crown further placed reliance on R v. Fenton [2019] EWCA Crim 2068, where the Court underscored the seriousness of repeat shoplifting in vulnerable retail settings.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

The court is mindful of the growing burden that acquisitive crime imposes upon public services. Police officers tasked with low-level theft investigations are often diverted from attending more serious matters, such as violent crime or organised drug trafficking. The administrative demands are considerable: witness interviews, evidence collation, technical forensic work, and compliance with disclosure obligations all consume finite resources.

Moreover, local authorities must absorb the fiscal impact of lost commercial revenue, increased security measures, and community distrust. These matters, while difficult to quantify, weigh heavily in the public interest analysis.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

The impact of repeat offending upon small independent businesses should not be underestimated. These shops, many already operating on marginal profit, cannot absorb continual stock losses without recourse to price increases, staff reductions, or even closure. This has ramifications for community cohesion, employment, and local economies.

There is an element of societal cost, too, considering that the thefts predominantly targeted pharmacies and corner stores relied upon by elderly and vulnerable populations. The court takes seriously any breach of trust within such essential service providers.

I further note the role played by the London Retail Crime Safety Alliance, whose reports indicate a troubling national escalation in shoplifting-related violence and theft during the post-pandemic period. While the present case does not involve violence, the environment reflects a contextual backdrop of diminished social norms and increased pressures upon retail workers.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

Before concluding, it is pertinent to mention certain instructive but unrelated case law that has emerged in recent appellate decisions. R v. Turnbull [2023] EWCA Crim 834 concerned aggravated burglary with violence; while entirely distinct on facts, the case reminds the court of the spectrum of seriousness across acquisitive offences and the necessity for proportionate sentencing.

Similarly, R v. Clarke [2024] EWCA Crim 1102 concerned importation of Class A substances and is of no direct application here, yet reflects the court’s wider sentencing jurisprudence emphasising community harm and culpability.

The technical enhancements in forensic providers’ capacity, including fingerprint and DNA analytics, increasingly encroach upon low-level crime investigations. Their application here, facilitated by the City Forensic Laboratory, is instructive of modern policing capabilities but also a reminder of resource intensiveness that must be justified by the nature and impact of offences.

In conclusion, the court has before it a well-documented series of offences characterised by repeated calculated thefts. Prior warnings and low-level disposals failed to deter your conduct. Psychiatric and probation reports assist in framing enquiry regarding risk and rehabilitation, yet personal agency and accountability remain central.

In accordance with section 153 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, the court must craft a sentence reflecting the seriousness of offending, promote rehabilitation, and protect the wider community.

At this juncture, the court finds it prudent to order the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report that considers community-based interventions as well as the prospect of custodial punishment, including the scope for structured sentence planning addressing offending behaviour linked to acquisitive crime, impulsivity, and psychosocial factors.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Finsbury Park. These proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal order of conviction and sentencing will be communicated to the relevant criminal records authorities. You, Mr H, are advised of your statutory right to appeal within 28 days of sentence, under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
