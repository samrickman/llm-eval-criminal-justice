IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. C2025/21487  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. R. MONTGOMERY  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing on a charge of theft, specifically shoplifting, brought pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct attributed to you spans a period commencing in late 2022 and extending until the early months of 2025, and involves multiple retail premises located within the city of Birmingham and adjoining districts. This court has now been presented with the materials necessary to form a comprehensive view on the circumstances of your offending, your personal background, and the suitable response required by law.

Procedural History  
The procedural landscape of this matter is not without complexity. You were initially arrested on 1 April 2025 by officers from the West Midlands Police Retail Crime Unit following a multi-agency investigation, with input from the Birmingham Business Crime Reduction Partnership, local security firms, and the West Midlands Emergency Services Digital Intelligence Taskforce. Your arrest came after a protracted period of intelligence gathering and collaborative surveillance efforts, including the review of closed-circuit television recordings, electronic transaction logs, and witness statements. Such investigative efforts, while routine in certain respects, demand a significant allocation of public service resources at both financial and operational levels. Notably, the deployment of digital analysts from the West Midlands Cyber Forensics Unit was mandated due to the prevalence of obfuscation techniques noted in the sessions under review.

It is important to observe that the genesis of this prosecution lies not only in the detection of multiple discrete instances of theft but also in the emergent pattern which grave concern for the retail sector led to its escalation. The importance of inter-agency cooperation in such cases cannot be overstated. The court wishes to place on record its acknowledgment of the professionalism exhibited by store staff, police officers, and civilian volunteers who contributed evidence and assisted in reducing disruption to local commerce.

You were interviewed under police caution on 7 April 2025. During this interview, you initially denied all knowledge or involvement. However, forensic examination, including recovered possessions and digital evidence extracted from mobile telephony records, contradicted your account. Following this, formal charges were authorised on 15 April, encompassing multiple counts of theft, eventually consolidated into a single representative count in the interest of judicial economy. The case was transferred to the Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) regime, where pre-trial listing and preparation followed established procedural norms.  

The BCM process was utilised here with relative success, despite wider national concerns regarding resource constraints and case backlogs in the criminal justice system. This court notes with no small measure of concern ongoing reports of understaffing in probation services and the impact this has on timely report preparation and effective supervision following sentencing. A noted difficulty is the burgeoning caseload notwithstanding austerity-era reductions in government funding for such statutory agencies.

The listing for sentence was initially fixed for 30 August 2025; however, this hearing was adjourned at the request of your counsel to await delivery of a supplementary psychiatric report commissioned through the Legal Aid Agency’s funding regime. Regrettably, the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative handling of your application suffered delays, including requests for clarification and supplemental documentation before authority was granted on 18 July 2025. This impeded timely preparation and has been a matter of repeated judicial criticism at various levels, reflecting a systemic challenge in the allocation of scarce funding amidst growing demand. The court nonetheless appreciates the tenacity of your solicitor, Mr Damian Ellis, who has accommodated these bureaucratic obstacles in diligent pursuit of your interests.

The psychiatric report was produced by Dr Natasha Henderson, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at the Midlands Institute of Mental Health. Dr Henderson’s report was both thorough and professionally reasoned, comprising clinical interview, neuropsychological testing, and review of collateral documentation, including health records and probation notes. It is of note that the report highlights significant features of your mental state and developmental history, which are addressed further below. The probation service has also prepared a presentence report, reflecting on your risk profile and suitability for community-based interventions.

I extend thanks to Crown Counsel, Ms Nadine Carter, for her clear and measured submissions, reflecting the prosecution’s appreciation of both evidentiary strengths and areas warranting cautious application of sentencing principles. Defence Counsel, Mr Ellis, has likewise advanced submissions addressing mitigation and systemic factors pertinent to your case, including your mental health status and social circumstances.

The court today sits in the newly refurbished Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court, which has undergone recent upgrades to improve accessibility and technology provision. A minor point of procedural inconvenience arose with the late arrival of an interpreter for a witness in an unrelated case, causing a brief delay of fifteen minutes, and this court appreciates the patience of all parties affected.

It is pertinent to acknowledge the role of the Retail Support and Recovery Network (RSRN), a voluntary-sector body specializing in victim and business support in cases of acquisitive crime. The Network has submitted detailed statements describing the emotional and financial toll of repeated theft on shop staff and owners. The court also thanks the local branch of Community Aid Staff Outreach (CASO) for providing ancillary assistance to those impacted.

Legal Context  
The relevant statutory regime, enshrined in the Theft Act 1968, section 1, defines the offence of theft as the appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving that person of it. The present case concerns multiple instances of such conduct, committed openly and repeatedly within retail premises, albeit with restraint and without recourse to violence or intimidation.

Sentencing in cases of theft seeks to balance a number of considerations — the culpability of the offender, the impact upon victims and the wider community, the offender’s antecedents, prospects for rehabilitation, and the overarching need for deterrence and public protection.

The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences, published in 2019, provides a framework emphasising the seriousness of which means such offences emanate from calculated intent, sustained repetition, and the effect upon vulnerable victims, including small business owners and their employees.

The case law is instructive. For example, in R v Cheney [2017] EWCA Crim 1234, the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence for a series of thefts from a family-run convenience store, despite modest individual values of stolen goods, on the grounds of cumulative harm and breach of trust.

Likewise, R v Roberts [2020] EWCA Crim 337 carved out principles pertaining to the reduction of sentence arising from early guilty plea. The timing of the plea bears heavily on the extent of credit and reflects genuine remorse and procedural efficiency rather than tactical expediency.

It is incumbent upon the court to apply these authorities with due regard to the facts before it, which, as will appear, display a pattern of defiant behaviour interlaced with episodes of apparent insight.

It is necessary now, therefore, to turn to a fuller narrative of the facts.

The facts reveal you entered various retail outlets with intentional concealment methods, often timing your movements to coincide with moments when staff were distracted or occupied. Observations from store personnel describe a manner both composed and deliberate, betraying experience and planning.

Circumstantial evidence indicated the use of lined bags and clothing elements selectively removed or rearranged to facilitate the unobserved removal of goods. On one occasion, an employee expressed discomfort at the defendant’s apparent reconnaissance of security layouts and exits.

It should be noted that during one surveillance operation, a co-defendant was apprehended for possession of an offensive weapon after an altercation in a car park adjacent to the store. While entirely unconnected to you, this incident illustrates the volatile environment in which these retail offences often occur and the heightened concern for public safety in such precincts.

The staff victim impact statements presented describe a palpable atmosphere of anxiety arising from repeated thefts. One manager recounted how employees altered their shift patterns due to anxiety, leading to reduced availability and increased operational difficulty. This is compounded by financial losses borne by retailers, who often absorb shrinkage without compensation, adding to the strain on already precarious small businesses.

The evidence includes multiple reports of your reoffending within months of community-based interventions initiated by local Police and Community Safety Partnerships. These included cautions and diversion schemes with referrals for support services.

Expert and Risk Assessments  
The psychiatric expert, Dr Henderson, notes you do not meet diagnostic criteria for a major psychiatric disorder but observes traits consistent with impulsivity, limited problem-solving skills, and a degree of substance misuse history. She also highlights a significant history of childhood neglect and disrupted education, with resultant emotional dysregulation.

Dr Henderson emphasises that, while a custodial sentence may risk deterioration in your mental health, the absence of frank psychosis or severe cognitive impairment reduces the scope for disposals focused primarily on therapeutic intervention. Treatment packages within custodial settings, including substance misuse programmes and cognitive skills modules, are envisaged but subject to availability.

The probation report assesses your current risk of reoffending as moderate to high, with a specific focus on acquisitive crime. It notes your sporadic engagement with support agencies and irregular attendance at voluntary appointments, which undermines efforts at rehabilitation. That report carefully recommends exploring community orders featuring rehabilitation activity requirements, integrated substance misuse treatment, and unpaid work as both punitive and restorative options.

The court is also told by probation that their staff face severe caseload pressures, exacerbated by recent funding cuts and recruitment challenges. This continues to impact both report preparation and offender supervision at critical junctures, notwithstanding valiant efforts at local offices.

It must be observed that while your engagement with the criminal justice system to date has been punctuated by periods of compliance, these have been consistently overshadowed by reoffending, suggesting an entrenched pattern rather than intermittent lapses.

Your personal circumstances are characterised by residential instability: you currently reside in temporary accommodation provided under local authority duty, having endured a reported period of street homelessness in 2024. While attempts have been made to involve family members, these have met with limited success, and you report ongoing difficulties in accessing employment due to your criminal record.

Mr H, it would be remiss to ignore the wider societal context. The court is aware that in recent years, the convergence of economic austerity, cuts to public services, and the ongoing public health crisis has placed tremendous pressure on communities throughout Birmingham and beyond. Homelessness and substance misuse have increased, and demand on already stretched mental health and social services has risen disproportionately.

A further digression is warranted: the court recalls the recent judgment in R v Whittaker [2024] EWCA Crim 893, which addressed the interface between acquisitive crime, mental health vulnerabilities, and community sentencing options. While that case involved a defendant with a psychotic disorder, the principles of proportionality and calibrated intervention remain relevant.

Moreover, the Local Criminal Justice Board’s annual report for 2024 highlights concerns that delays in court processes, particularly attributed to staff shortages and backlog, impose additional stress on defendants with complex needs, potentially exacerbating risk and hindering timely rehabilitation.

Before turning to submissions, it is worth considering the experience of the court in relation to the Legal Aid Agency, which, as earlier noted, has struggled to process funding applications with sufficient expedition. The friction of administrative delay is no academic concern: it carries real human cost in protracted pre-trial uncertainty and deferred access to expert advice.

Defence submissions remind this court of your expression of remorse in correspondence dated 7 July 2025, which the court records as sincere but tempered by a history of repeated offending. Defence counsel urges consideration of your mental health status, personal history of trauma, and housing insecurity, advocating for community-based sentencing where possible. The Crown submits that, whilst recognising these factors and your eventual guilty plea, the pattern of persistent reoffending and disregard for prior warnings justifies a custodial sentence designed to underscore deterrence and public protection.

It is notable that the plea was entered on 11 September 2025, after significant case preparation and shortly before the trial date. Thus, the credit for the plea is limited, reflecting established case law including R v King [2023] EWCA Crim 540, which regulates discounting where pleas are entered late in proceedings.

In assessing this case, this court applies the overarching principles set out in The Criminal Justice Act 2003 and the comprehensive Sentencing Council guidelines. The need to balance punishment, rehabilitation, and community protection remains paramount.

While the monetary value of stolen goods across the aggregated offences is not high, the cumulative financial and psychological impact upon local businesses, staff, and wider community undermines the fabric of public confidence in security and lawful commerce. Such intangible harm merits significant weight in sentencing.

In conclusion, this court is now mindful of the following considerations: your description as a defendant of limited pro-social attachment, patterns of acquisitive offending exhibiting both planning and repetition; a history of non-engagement with support services; and the marked impact on victims and staff of repeated theft causing distress and economic loss. Equally, the court notes mitigating factors including your current homelessness, expressed remorse, and the absence of serious violence or threat.

It remains essential that any sentencing decision takes full account of public interest in deterrence and rehabilitation while providing proportionate and just sanctions.

I propose to order the preparation of a further pre-sentence report, reflecting latest input from mental health services and updated risk assessments. This is to be submitted without delay to expedite the final determination of sentence.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed and duly recorded in line with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to relevant authorities for inclusion in criminal records registers. You are informed of your right to appeal against any sentence imposed within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
