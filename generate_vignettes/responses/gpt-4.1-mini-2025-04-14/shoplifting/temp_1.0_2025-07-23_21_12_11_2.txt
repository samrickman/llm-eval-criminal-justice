IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEICESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14567  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L. CARRINGTON  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before the court following conviction for shoplifting offences committed over a protracted period within the Leicester city centre and adjoining suburbs. The prosecution charge, laid under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, encapsulates a representative count selected from multiple incidents documented by local retail security teams. These offences—though individually of low monetary value—constitute a pattern of persistent illicit behaviour with identifiable public consequences.

Procedural History and Case Progression  
Your case first came before the Magistrates’ Court on 3 March 2025, at which hearing you indicated a not guilty plea. The proceedings were transferred to this Crown Court jurisdiction due principally to the number and complexity of the charges involved, as well as the anticipated need for detailed disclosure and forensic evidence presentation. On 10 July, following disclosure of extensive CCTV footage, witness statements, and forensic reports, your plea was altered to guilty. The court notes that the plea was entered after a trial window had opened, entailing a lesser degree of credit consistent with the principles recently reaffirmed in R v Whelan [2024] EWCA Crim 997.

It is unfortunate but true that the trajectory before the court aligns with a well-recognised pattern in acquisitive offending: defendants are frequently reluctant to admit guilt early, opting instead to test the Crown’s evidence—a process which leads to increased cost and delay, and significant inconvenience to witnesses and victims. This court is always mindful that the charge of theft, particularly in its more repetitive manifestations, does not demand an unyielding or severe response out of proportion to the damage caused; yet it must also be acknowledged that the public and private harms can accumulate significantly over time.

Of procedural note is the efficient liaison conducted between the Leicester Business Crime Initiative, local policing teams, and the City Crime Reduction Partnership. This model seeks to integrate intelligence sharing, victim support, and offender management, aiming to mitigate the impact of theft-related crime on commercial premises. The monthly coordination meetings, often hampered by staff shortages and competing priorities, nonetheless produced cohesive operational plans in this case—culminating in apprehension and evidence collation.

It has not escaped the court’s attention that delays persist within the legal aid landscape, exacerbated here by difficulties securing timely approval for psychological assessment. These perennial bureaucratic obstacles slow the course of justice and impair effective defence preparation, as I remarked in R v Johnson [2023] Leicester Crown Court 214. The frustrations of legal practitioners and defendants alike regarding administrative inertia are well-founded, and judicial authorities continue to advocate for streamlining and resourcing reforms.

Relevant Legal Context  
The Theft Act 1968 remains the primary legislative instrument governing the offences under consideration here, defining theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive. Shoplifting, while ostensibly a minor crime, has been the subject of extensive jurisprudence regarding the gradations of culpability, the importance of victim impact, and the proportionality of sentencing responses.

Although the aggregate financial loss in cases akin to yours may appear modest, the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences (issued 2023) emphasises the significance of the offender’s attitude, the persistence of the offending, and the consequences for victims and communities. It further identifies aggravating factors such as the targeting of vulnerable premises, repeat offending, and the psychological toll on staff.

Illustrative appellate decisions lend context. For example, R v Beaumont [2022] EWCA Crim 1305 underscored the particular seriousness attaching to theft from small independent concerns, whose limited margins and staffing make them disproportionately vulnerable to shrinkage. Meanwhile, R v Gilmore [2021] EWCA Crim 824 highlighted the importance of early guilty pleas in mitigating sentences, drawing attention to the burden imposed by delayed admissions. Although the facts of these rulings differ from the instant case, their principles resonate strongly.

I must also mention, albeit tangentially, R v Summers [2019] EWCA Crim 715, a case involving aggravated burglary which resulted in a custodial sentence exceeding four years. Its relevance lies principally in illustrating the sentencing distinction courts make between acquisitive crime absent violence and offences where personal risk to victims is heightened.

The following paragraphs provide an outline of your conduct as established at trial.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

The incidents, as described in witness testimonies and corroborated by CCTV evidence, demonstrate a calculated approach. You regularly frequented a number of retail outlets specialising in personal care products and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, in some instances exploiting periods of staff rotation or employing diversionary tactics.

A notable example recounted by the manager of a high street convenience store involved the use of an item of clothing to conceal merchandise before exiting without payment. There was no physical confrontation recorded, yet staff morale has been described as affected, leading to adjustments in shift patterns and security protocols.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

Your record indicates prior engagements with community resolution schemes aimed at diverting you from criminal activity, but these appear to have had limited deterrent effect. The recurrence of similar conduct raises questions about the effectiveness of such measures absent meaningful behavioural intervention.

The impact on victims, while not catastrophic in a material sense, was compounded by the frequency of incidents and the attendant anxiety engendered amongst staff, some of whom reported feelings of vulnerability and distress. The cumulative economic loss, though individually minor, amounted to a significant figure when aggregated across all affected businesses.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

It is pertinent to highlight that local policing teams involved in this matter operate under pressing conditions, facing demands not only from acquisitive crime but also a rising tide of violence and disorder. The diversion of specialist resources—including digital forensic analysts tasked with extracting and analysing CCTV footage—entails substantial public expense, underscoring the gravity with which persistent shoplifting is now treated.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

You were arrested on 14 April 2025 following a sustained operation conducted by the Leicester Metropolitan Police Service's Crime Reduction Unit. The investigative phase featured the utilisation of judicially authorised mobile device location data and multi-agency review meetings. The level of coordination required is resource-intensive, and reflects a strategic priority to address acquisitive crime as a systemic threat rather than an isolated nuisance.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

The court is mindful of the strain placed upon voluntary sector agencies as well. Notably, the Leicester Retail Workers Support Group provided outreach to staff affected by your offending, offering counselling and signposting. Their submissions to this court were measured, acknowledging that your actions neither involved violence nor threats, but emphasising the ongoing stress experienced by their clients.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Further, the Community Rehabilitation Company’s pre-sentence report, completed by Officer Sarah Lombard, portrays a defendant who suffers from episodic depression and demonstrates a degree of impulsivity but presents a low risk of harm to the public. The report recommends the exploration of structured cognitive behavioural therapy programmes alongside financial literacy support, in the hope of reducing reoffending.

It is regrettable that the defendant has declined assistance from local food banks and housing liaison officers, resources which, while stretched thin, remain available. The choice to eschew such support complicates rehabilitation efforts and places greater emphasis on judicial intervention.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Section 152A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 governs the credit that may be awarded for guilty pleas. This court adopts a measured approach as to any reduction. The late nature of your admission means that only limited credit is appropriate, consistent with the recent decision in R v Canning [2025] EWCA Crim 112, which curtailed plea-based discounts where they come after extensive pre-trial preparation and witness mobilisation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

Turning briefly to matters of public policy, it is plain that acquisitive crimes, even when non-violent, erode community confidence and contribute to a wider atmosphere of insecurity. The phenomenon of repeat shoplifting not only affects the immediate victims but can precipitate business closures, job losses, and the decline of local high streets—a trend well-documented in recent years.

Against this backdrop, the court is aware of a growing body of literature critiquing the normalisation of low-level offending, often associated with factors such as economic marginalisation, housing instability, and substance misuse. While these considerations do not excuse unlawful conduct, they do inform sentencing solutions designed to address root causes alongside deterrence.

Notable is the fact that courts frequently grapple with balancing custodial sentences against community-based penalties, especially given the limited prison capacity and the high costs associated with incarceration. In the current climate, sentences integrating rehabilitation and reparation are favoured where appropriate, but the threshold for custody remains clear when offenders display persistence and disregard for prior interventions.

It is incumbent upon the court to tailor its response proportionately — recognising both the defendant’s personal circumstances and the societal need for order and confidence in the rule of law.

The case has been heard in a recently refurbished courtroom, with thanks extended to the registrar and court ushers for their assistance in ensuring the smooth conduct of proceedings. Their roles, often overlooked, contribute materially to the administration of justice.

During the preparation of reports, this court received correspondence from Mr H’s sister, Ms Nadia Lawrence, highlighting familial concerns and expressing hope for a rehabilitative disposition. We also acknowledge letters from the Leicester Homeless Outreach Service, which document your sporadic engagement with housing support attempts, albeit undermined by irregular attendance and communication lapses.

We cannot afford to ignore the very real challenges facing mental health provision across the region. Waiting lists for Community Mental Health Teams now extend into months, and NHS-funded counselling for individuals with mild to moderate depression remains scarce. Such systemic failings impact many defendants, including yourself, but the justice system must nonetheless uphold its duty to protect the public.

In our jurisdiction, the deployment of multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) applies predominantly to those assessed as posing significant risks of serious harm. Your profile does not engage MAPPA thresholds but does suggest the utility of lighter-touch Community Offender Manager supervision with periodic review.

I also take this opportunity to note a recent case, R v. Petrovich [2025] EWCA Crim 242, concerning a defendant convicted of fly-tipping hazardous waste. In that sentencing, the court affirmed that environmental harm may attract custodial sentences when evidence demonstrates a deliberate disregard for public health. The principles enunciated resonate with the approach to persistent acquisitive offending: consequences may be less visible but nonetheless impactful.

Similarly, the court recalls R v Barker [2023] EWCA Crim 742, where possession of a bladed article in a school car park prompted an immediate custodial sentence due to the risk to children. Though unrelated to your offences, this case exemplifies the seriousness with which courts treat threats to community safety.

Repeated failures to comply with community orders highlight problems in offender management. A co-defendant in a recent theft case—unrelated to you—was found to have assaulted officers with a chair during arrest, illustrating the variability of offender profiles and consequent risk assessments.

You have been unhindered by any known associations with organised crime networks or gangs, and there is no evidence of coercion or exploitative involvement in your offending. However, the pattern reflects an entrenched problem that requires decisive judicial response.

It is worth recording, as a peripheral note, that shortages loomed large within the Leicester Free Legal Advice Bureau during the early months of 2025. While you were able to secure representation, many defendants in similar positions have experienced protracted waits, sometimes necessitating adjournments.

Turning to victim impact, the written statements tendered by retail managers reveal a profound and understandable weariness. While no physical harm occurred, the anxiety caused by repeated incidents erodes employee well-being and productivity. These intangible harms must be recognised in the sentencing calculus.

I conclude by emphasising the court’s preference, where feasible, for sentences with a rehabilitative dimension. After consideration of the evidence and reports, it appears that a community sentence tailored to your needs might reduce the risk of reoffending more effectively than incarceration, assuming your engagement.

Nonetheless, the gravity of persistence and the necessity for general deterrence cannot be overlooked.

I will therefore, in accordance with established sentencing practice, adjourn this matter for the preparation of a full pre-sentence report from the National Probation Service, including an assessment of risk, vulnerability, and appropriate rehabilitative or punitive options. Such a report should include consideration of cognitive-behavioural work addressing acquisitive offending, alongside any feasible mental health interventions.

I note with appreciation the work of the Leicester Retail Support Network, whose victim liaison efforts and policy submissions assist in bringing forth a frank and humanising perspective.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 4 at Leicester Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction will be transmitted to the relevant registries. You are hereby informed of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs will be reserved pending further direction upon sentencing.

These are the orders of the court.
