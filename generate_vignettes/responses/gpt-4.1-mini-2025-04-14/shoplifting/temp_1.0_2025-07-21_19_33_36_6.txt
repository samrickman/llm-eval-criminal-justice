IN THE CROWN COURT AT DUNBRIDGE  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. D2025/17540  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. EMMETT  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence upon your conviction for theft, specifically repeated shoplifting, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The particulars of the offending span a considerable period, from late 2023 through to the early months of 2025, with incidents occurring across several retail premises within the Dunbridge metropolitan area. This case arises amid continuing concerns regarding acquisitive crime and its impact on local commerce, as well as the more diffuse societal toll it exerts. 

Procedural Overview and Context  
Your arrest was effected on 18 March 2025 following a significant operation by the Dunbridge Metropolitan Police Service (DMPS), coordinated in conjunction with retail security personnel, the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership, and the Safer Dunbridge Team. This multi-agency effort sought to address escalating reports of retail theft concentrated in the city centre, with a specific focus on recurrent offenders habitually returning to the same outlets despite previous interventions. The investigation required detailed collation of video evidence, witness statements, and forensic analysis of recovered stolen goods.  

The protracted nature of this inquiry, spanning a period of approximately three months, reflects the broader difficulties faced by law enforcement in managing low-level but persistent shoplifting offences. The DMPS has confirmed that resource allocation to such cases is increasingly challenged by pressures elsewhere, particularly in response to violent crime and public disorder incidents. This case exemplifies the tension between limited policing capacity and the persistent demand generated by property crime reporting. It is relevant to observe that, as part of the investigation, substantial effort was placed upon the analysis of CCTV imagery, which, while invaluable in confirming identity and behaviour, presented its own challenges. Poor lighting, obstructions, and intermittent camera angles required painstaking review. This is not an uncommon hurdle, as has been remarked upon in prior Crown Court observations concerning acquisition offences.  

It is also noteworthy—although tangential to your personal circumstances—that during the early stages of the enquiry, the Legal Aid Agency was engaged to facilitate your representation. There were regrettable delays in authorising funding for a forensic psychiatrist to conduct a clinical assessment. The initial application, submitted on 3 April 2025, awaited approval until mid-May, notwithstanding multiple reminders from your defence team. Such administrative inertia unfortunately is emblematic of wider systemic pressures faced by the Agency nationwide and frequently impacts timely case progression.  

At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 15 June 2025, you entered a not guilty plea. Following the disclosure of additional evidence, including enhanced CCTV footage and corroborating statements from retail personnel, you entered a plea of guilty on 4 September 2025, shortly before the trial listing. The court recognises the procedural importance of timing in pleas and the impact on sentencing credit, as elucidated in the jurisprudence.

While cases of this nature often elicit a degree of public indifference—being perceived as minor infractions—they carry broader implications. The cumulative effect of such crime strains policing priorities and undermines community confidence in local retail sectors. The court is mindful of the impact on those employed in vulnerable positions, including shop assistants and managers, who frequently bear the immediate brunt of these infringements.  

A thematic concern highlighted in recent years has been the business community’s reliance on private security measures and the interplay between public enforcement agencies and private retail bodies in tackling shoplifting. The Dunbridge Business Crime Reduction Partnership’s recent annual report underscored the challenges in information sharing and resource coordination, particularly against a backdrop of funding retrenchment across municipal services. There is, regrettably, uneven participation in these schemes, with some businesses electing not to engage for fear of reputational damage or administrative burden.  

Your pattern of offences forms a subset of the rising trend of repeat acquisitive crime — a phenomenon that has been subject to extensive criminological and policy discussion. Key reports, such as the 2023 Home Office Review on Retail Theft, have suggested that persistent offenders frequently share common underlying vulnerabilities including substance misuse, unstable housing, and complex mental health needs. It becomes imperative, therefore, not merely to punish but to consider tailored interventions that address these root causes alongside safeguarding public protection.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

This court has had the opportunity to reflect on these dynamics in prior cases and notes the importance—as stressed in sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council in February 2024—that responses must be proportionate, informed by risk assessment, and attentive to both the victim’s experience and the offender’s circumstances. 

It is relevant too to discuss, albeit peripherally, the status of your defence representation. Mr Oliver Neville, instructed through a Legal Aid order, has engaged conscientiously. I must record formally the court’s growing concern over systemic legal aid delays, which frequently necessitate adjournments and compromise timely justice. On this occasion, though, I commend the expedient correspondence and submissions tendered by Mr Neville, who has maintained a full and active presence throughout.  

A notable feature of your defence was the commissioning of a psychiatric assessment by Dr Gillian Harper, an experienced forensic psychiatrist appointed following the protracted Legal Aid approval process. Her report, submitted last month, is comprehensive and medically informed but ultimately offers limited exculpatory insights with respect to your criminal responsibility. Dr Harper identifies traits consistent with intermittent depressive episodes and a degree of social anxiety but finds no major mental disorder.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

The report emphasizes, however, that your engagement with community mental health services has been sporadic, and you have declined offers of referral to specialist addiction support despite a disclosed history of problematic alcohol use. This clinical observation aligns with probation service assessments, which characterise your motivation to comply with proposed support arrangements as fluctuating and ambivalent.  

Turning now to the legal framework, it is fitting to revisit the origins of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, a seminal statute designed to codify theft as dishonestly appropriating property with the intent to permanently deprive. This provision has endured legislative scrutiny and interpretive refinements over the decades yet remains the primary legal tool for prosecuting shoplifting and related offences.  

The sentencing landscape for theft offences has evolved significantly. Since the introduction of the guideline framework promulgated by the Sentencing Council in 2022, sentencers are guided to consider offence seriousness, value of goods taken, offender culpability, and aggravating or mitigating features such as use of threats, prior criminality, and degree of planning. Particular attention is given to repeat offending patterns, as these signal entrenched behaviour less amenable to leniency.  

It is not without significance that recent Court of Appeal decisions—such as R v. Brandt [2023] EWCA Crim 1227—highlight the court’s diminishing tolerance for recidivist behaviours, affirming that where an offender rebuffs previously successful diversion tactics or conditional discharges, custodial penalties are more readily justified. Brandt involved an offender with a history of retail theft who escalated to organized shoplifting with accomplices, a fact dissimilar to your case but instructive in the principles governing escalation and deterrence.  

Moreover, in the case of R v. Lomas [2021] EWCA Crim 1998, the Court affirmed that where theft offences occur in settings where victims are particularly vulnerable—such as lone workers or small proprietors—the psychological impact is an important sentencing factor. This principle is salient in light of victim impact statements received from employees at the affected shops in your case, which attest to anxiety, loss of confidence, and disruption of workplace routines.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

Although your offending did not involve physical confrontation or direct threats, the court recognises that the cumulative impact of repeated thefts exerts a considerable toll on community welfare and business viability. There is a cascading effect whereby losses are absorbed by smaller retailers through increased prices, lowered staffing, or curtailed opening hours — outcomes that frustrate consumer access and diminish local economic health.  

At the same time, sentencing must balance deterrence with rehabilitation. The report from the Dunbridge Probation Service, authored by Officer Serena Mullen and dated 29 August 2025, provides a nuanced appraisal of your personal circumstances and abbreviated case history. The report contextualises your offending within a pattern of chronic financial insecurity, interrupted tenancy arrangements, and limited familial support.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

The probation officer’s narrative draws attention to your repeated failure to meet previous community orders, including non-compliance with unpaid work requirements and poor engagement with addressable substance misuse services. Insofar as risk management is concerned, Ms Mullen assesses medium likelihood of reoffending absent intensive intervention. She recommends consideration of a structured supervision order incorporating elements such as cognitive-behavioural therapy and local supported housing assistance.  

It is necessary here to acknowledge, though, the broader institutional strains affecting probation services in Dunbridge and nationally. Staffing shortages, increased caseloads, and constrained budgets limit capacity for comprehensive intervention. Community rehabilitation companies and statutory probation providers alike confront difficult choices in prioritising offenders. This reality underscores the importance of courts formulating sentences that align realistically with available resources to optimise outcomes of supervision and compliance.  

I also wish to highlight the voluntary sector’s involvement, including the efforts of the Dunbridge Outreach Support Network (DOSN), who have submitted letters confirming prior engagement with you concerning welfare support and budgeting assistance. Despite their commendable and sustained commitments, DOSN reports limited uptake from your side. This pattern is unfortunately reflective of wider challenges in motivating behaviour change among offenders with entrenched vulnerabilities.  

Turning to the significant authorities on plea credit, the court must reflect the principle that early guilty pleas accrue more substantial discount than late admissions. This was affirmed in R v. Mallon [2024] EWCA Crim 502, which reiterated that late pleas, particularly those entered proximate to trial dates, attract curtailed mitigation to reflect the extended burden on victims, witnesses, and court resources.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

In your case, the timing of the plea necessitates modest discount, in accordance with these principles. Notwithstanding this, the fact of admission is acknowledged as genuine and not solely tactical.  

I must, as ever, emphasise that courts are not blind to the social contexts and pressures leading individuals to acquisitive offences. It is an unfortunate but accurate observation that many who face destitution, housing precarity, and unmet health needs are at elevated risk of contact with the justice system. However, the law draws a clear line: hardship does not equate to immunity from responsibility, nor does vulnerability excuse recidivism.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

Courts are repeatedly reminded of, and compelled to apply, the guidance set out in the Criminal Justice Joint Inspection report of 2023, which highlights the pressing need for integrated responses to acquisitive crime that marry enforcement with welfare. While holistic solutions are beyond the immediate remit of the court, sentencing decisions resonate most effectively when aligned with systemic supports.  

I note with interest, though unrelated to you directly, the recent decision in R v. Sterling [2025] EWCA Crim 119, which involved possession of an offensive weapon during a public disorder event. Mr Sterling was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. That case’s relevance here is illustrative only in underscoring the judiciary’s measured approach across offence spectra, particularly with respect to danger to the public. Your offences, by contrast, occupy a different tier of seriousness but nevertheless warrant careful scrutiny in the broader context of public safety and rehabilitation.  

Likewise, it is worth mentioning an unrelated case management matter: a co-defendant in a separate trial at this court last month absconded prior to sentence after a conviction for benefit fraud. Such occurrences exemplify challenges faced in enforcing compliance, but have no bearing on your matters.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

The court has reviewed your personal statement and the character references tendered on your behalf, including letters from the Dunbridge Community Food Bank and the Westgate Housing Charitable Trust. These documents bear testimony to your expressed remorse and the goodwill of certain local agencies. However, they must be weighed against the pattern of repetitive behaviour and fragmented engagement with support providers outlined above.  

In conclusion, this court is poised to consider options ranging from custodial sentences, suspended sentences with conditions, community orders, or combinations thereof. The overriding objective remains the protection of the public coupled with fostering your rehabilitation and reducing reoffending risk.  

The court will direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report, focusing on your suitability for community-based interventions—including cognitive skills programmes, substance misuse treatment, and accommodation support—as
