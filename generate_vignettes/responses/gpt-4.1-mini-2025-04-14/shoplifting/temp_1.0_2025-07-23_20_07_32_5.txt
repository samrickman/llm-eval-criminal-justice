IN THE CROWN COURT AT RIVERSIDE  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. CR2025/04831  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Eleanor J. Voss  
Filed: 22 August 2025  

Mr H, you stand today before this court for sentence in relation to a representative charge of theft, specifically shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct comprises a series of incidents extending over a period of approximately eighteen months, within which multiple retail premises across the Riverside and adjoining boroughs suffered losses that, in aggregate, represent a significant disruption to local businesses.

Procedural History  
The genesis of proceedings in this matter traces back to the initial police report lodged on 18 December 2023, prompted by concerns raised by retailers associated with the Riverside Business Crime Reduction Scheme (RBCRS). This partnership, while intended to foster coordinated and proactive responses to acquisitive crime, has struggled in recent years amidst funding cuts and the unintended consequences of repeated operational demands, particularly throughout the ongoing COVID-19 recovery phase and its aftermath. The RBCRS database identified several instances where loss prevention teams reported a male individual ostensibly fitting the description of Mr H, engaging in surreptitious activity consistent with theft. These observations led to the compilation of supplementary intelligence, including geo-spatial mapping of suspect movements and cross-referencing with social media reports alleging increased incidents of “grab and run” thefts in high footfall areas.

The investigation itself was protracted. Officers from Riverside Borough's Dedicated Theft Unit (DTU) were tasked with collating CCTV evidence, conducting witness interviews, and searching for corroborative forensic traces. The DTU’s workload has been compounded in this period by a notable uptick in volume crime generally, creating an operational backlog. That backlog, while regrettable, is not unique to Riverside, but instead mirrors trends seen nationally—a phenomenon explored in the recent Home Office report “Managing Frontline Policing 2024.”

Your arrest took place on 15 April 2025, following authorisation obtained upon the submission of a detailed intelligence package to the deputy senior investigating officer. The package included an analysis of signal triangulation data secured via judicial warrant from telecommunications providers, further buttressing evidentiary strands linking you to multiple theft locations. It is pertinent to observe that such forms of covert surveillance are subject to strict statutory controls under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 and require judicial oversight precisely because of their intrusive nature. The careful adherence to these procedural safeguards underscores the seriousness with which the authorities viewed your conduct.

The case was allocated to this court under the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative, which has now been incorporated into standard Crown Court practice since 2020. BCM aims to expedite the trial process and reduce the attritional delays that previously afflicted criminal jurisdictions. However, it must be acknowledged that resource constraints, industrial action, and increasing case complexity have cumulatively eroded some of the original efficiencies BCM sought to deliver. In your matter, the plea and trial preparation hearing were initially scheduled for 1 July 2025. Due to a procedural application from your solicitor, seeking further disclosure pertaining to CCTV footage and ancillary witness statements, the hearing was adjourned to 15 July 2025. On that date, you entered a guilty plea, following receipt of enhanced evidential materials and expert forensic reports.

Though your plea was not entered at the earliest opportunity, it is nevertheless recognised by the court. As stated in the Court of Appeal decisions such as R v. Sunderland [2020] EWCA Crim 1804 and R v. Connors [2021] EWCA Crim 909, sentencing credits for guilty pleas are a matter of judicial discretion informed by timing, motivation, and demonstrable remorse. It is a well-settled principle that the earliest possible plea garners the greatest discount, save for exceptional circumstances. This court, mindful of these precedents, will accordingly calibrate any reduction in sentence.

I acknowledge with gratitude the work of the Crown Prosecution Service in preparing and presenting this case. I also thank Mr David Marsh, instructed on your behalf under an authorised Legal Aid representation order. Mr Marsh has complied fully with all directions and conducted his duties professionally and diligently. Although matters were inevitably delayed by the need to secure funding for a psychiatric assessment—with the Legal Aid Agency initially deferring applications pending additional documentation—these issues were ultimately resolved in a manner consistent with the statutory entitlement to expert reports.

This trend of bureaucratic delay in expert instruction is cause for concern across the courts. The justice system is increasingly reliant upon timely provision of psychological assessments to inform sentencing decisions, particularly for offences with potential links to underlying vulnerability or mental health. Yet the current state of Legal Aid funding mechanisms, intermittently hampered by administrative bottlenecks and shifting eligibility criteria, constitutes an ongoing impediment. Such delay is neither in the interests of fairness nor efficiency.

Several victim impact statements have been tendered, provided by representatives of affected stores and staff members within the Riverside Retailers Association. These statements articulate the tangible and intangible harms occasioned by repeated theft—losses mounting in financial terms, the erosion of staff confidence, and the broader destabilisation of commercial premises in areas already contending with economic uncertainty. The sentiments expressed are measured and sincere, consistent with the conduct of a community seeking restoration and reassurance. It is paramount to the administration of justice that these voices be heard, even where the offences in question are classified as summary or low-level.

In sentencing you, I am also mindful of recent academic commentary on the social fabric within which acquisitive crime increasingly takes place. The seemingly incremental rise in urban street homelessness, coupled with complex patterns of substance misuse and mental health challenges, often form the backdrop for such offending. The court—however mindful of societal context—must apply the law dispassionately. I pause only to note the findings of the National Institute for Social Justice's 2024 report, which outlines significant systemic pressures on housing services, and the consequent strain on local authority capacities to provide adequate intervention and preventative support.

The Mental Health Assessment Report, prepared by consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Sonia Kingsley and dated 20 May 2025, offers relevant insights. Dr Kingsley characterised your mental state as within functional parameters, with no evidence of psychotic disorder or major cognitive impairment. The report notes some degree of emotional dysregulation and a tendency towards impulsivity, which, while potentially contributory to your behaviour, do not amount to mitigating factors sufficient to diminish responsibility. She recommends engagement with community mental health services, including cognitive-behavioural therapy aimed at impulsivity control. In addition, Dr Kingsley emphasises the absence of any established diagnosis of substance dependency, although notes some irregular use of alcohol in social settings.

This clinical input, though comprehensive, must be weighed alongside other factors, including your prior convictions. You have three antecedent theft-related convictions dating between 2017 and 2023. Of particular note is a caution issued in early 2024 for a similar offence, which followed a diversion programme involving a referral to a local charity focused on reducing recidivism.

In relation to your accommodation status, correspondence received from Riverside Housing Aid dated 11 August 2025, submitted on your behalf, outlines your current tenancy arrangements in supported housing within the borough. This facility caters to individuals with histories of housing instability and seeks to offer structured support with an emphasis on tenancy sustainment and life skills development.

The multidisciplinary caseworker involved commends your attendance at weekly support groups but notes inconsistent engagement with financial advisory sessions. It is regrettable that, despite available assistance, your offending conduct appears to have persisted, suggesting that additional intervention strategies may be required.

It is in the public interest that sanction serves not only to punish but also to deter and rehabilitate, thereby safeguarding both affected communities and yourself as an individual with potential for positive change. The Probation Service Pre-Sentence Report, dated 18 August 2025 and authored by Probation Officer Leah Ward, supports similar conclusions. Officer Ward highlights your expressed willingness to participate in rehabilitative programmes, including skills training and cognitive behavioural approaches designed to address acquisitive offending tendencies.

Such interventions are reflective of our custodial phase guidance as outlined in the Overarching Principles of Sentencing published by the Sentencing Council in 2023. These principles advocate for proportionality balanced with pragmatic pathways to assist offenders in reducing reoffending risk, notably through targeting criminogenic needs and promoting social reintegration.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

I also note the recent establishment of the Riverside Serious Offenders Initiative (RSOI), a multi-agency effort to identify individuals at medium to high risk of reoffending and to coordinate tailored packages of offence-specific support. Mr H, you are not currently assessed as high risk under this scheme but nevertheless stand to benefit from its resources should you engage effectively.

On a related note, it bears mention that the court has reviewed correspondence exchanged between your solicitor and the Crown, in which an historical case law reference was provided concerning R v. Harrison [2019] EWCA Crim 1378. That case considered the interplay of previous convictions and the threshold for custodial sentences in acquisitive crime. While its factual detail involves a significantly higher value of goods and an aggravated course of conduct including trespass, the principles articulated remain instructive.

Indeed, the Court of Appeal in Harrison emphasised the importance of recognising the repeated defiance of legal norms by offenders who otherwise manifest few immediate threats to personal safety but cause continuing economic and social harm. There, a custodial sentence was deemed appropriate notwithstanding the absence of violence, to signal clear societal repudiation of serial dishonesty.
