IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHWARK  
R v. MR H  
Case No. 29S/2025/06341  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge W. J. Carmichael  
Filed: 19 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence on a charge of theft from retail premises, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct alleged and now admitted spans an extended period from November 2023 to May 2025, predominantly taking place within the commercial zones of Southwark and neighbouring boroughs. The offence represents a continuation of prior patterns in the defendant’s history, where repeated incidents of dishonesty from shops and pharmacies have been recorded. 

It is necessary at the outset to record some observations concerning the nature of prosecutions for shoplifting offences in the current criminal justice climate. Cases of this type frequently involve a complex interplay between public resources and private sector cooperation, demanding considerable investigative input from police detectives, local Business Crime Reduction Partnerships, and prosecution casework teams. A further procedural note concerns the ongoing challenges faced by the courts due to staffing shortfalls in the Probation Service—a point to which I will return.  

Your arrest followed a meticulous and multi-agency investigative effort conducted over a period of several months during 2025. This operation required extensive collation of CCTV evidence, statements from retail staff, and forensic analysis of recovered property. Such investigations are not straightforward and impose significant administrative and financial costs on public bodies. Indeed, as observed in the recent report by the National Retail Crime Forum (2024), persistent low-level acquisitive offending imposes a disproportionate demand on policing resources, distracting from more serious crimes and causing cumulative harm to small businesses and their employees. 

The court is also mindful of the ongoing evolution of court procedures under the Better Case Management (BCM) regime. Since its introduction in 2016, BCM has sought to reduce delays, improve case progression, and ensure early clarity on the issues for trial and sentencing. Despite this, listing constraints and administrative burdens persist. Various hearings in this matter were subject to adjournments, some occasioned by defence applications to instruct expert witnesses and others reflecting pressures within court listings nationally.  

At a plea and trial preparation hearing held on 1 August 2025, you entered a plea of not guilty. However, following disclosure of further evidential material, including forensic matches and witness statements, you changed your plea to guilty at the first available opportunity thereafter on 15 August. The timing of your guilty plea is noted, though it cannot attract the full credit available for a plea entered at the earliest practical stage, as explained in R v. Thompson [2019] EWCA Crim 1234 and reaffirmed in R v. Clark [2023] EWCA Crim 587.  

A late plea—particularly common in acquisitive crime cases—is often the product not of sudden remorse but tactical evaluation, which places additional burdens on victims and justice services. The reduction in sentence credit in such circumstances is well established and prudent, given the strain that preparation for contested trials imposes on courts and witnesses alike.  

It is appropriate, here, to consider the broader legal framework. Section 1 Theft Act 1968 defines the essential elements of theft, including the requirement of dishonesty and the intention to permanently deprive the owner. These elements have been well expounded in Evans v. R [2016] UKSC 10 and reaffirmed in subsequent appellate decisions. Although the individual items stolen in cases like yours frequently possess low monetary value, the cumulative nature of offending significantly elevates culpability, particularly when repeated over prolonged periods, causing both economic and psychological harm.  

The Continuing Criminal Enterprise in Acquisitive Offending  
The Crown submits, with appropriate reliance on sentencing guidelines and statutory principles, that your offending constitutes a sustained course of dishonest conduct demonstrating planning, resolve, and disregard for prior warnings or interventions. This court concurs, viewing shoplifting in isolation as minor only if it is a single lapse; a serial pattern is, by contrast, a serious concern demanding proportionate sanction.  

Proper reference may be made here to R v. Merton [2024] EWCA Crim 2705, where a defendant’s pattern of repeated thefts from charity shops, including the removal of sensor tags and use of distraction tactics, led to an immediate custodial sentence upheld on appeal. The Court stressed the significance of the offending’s impact on vulnerable worker populations and the erosion of trust within the community.  

That said, while the sentencing guideline for theft offences provides a baseline framework, it remains vital that sentencing reflects the individual circumstances, risks, and potential for rehabilitation uniquely presented here. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines on theft (2023) emphasise factors such as the scale and frequency of offending, the degree of sophistication, the use of coercive or deceptive measures, and the effect on victims—all elements engaged here.  

Whilst this court regularly references the need for proportionality, it is also obliged to consider general deterrence and the protection of the public. Persistent acquisitive offending drains public and private resources, undermines confidence in the retail sector, and affects workers who are often low-paid and vulnerable. A sentence must balance these competing interests.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

Experience teaches that whilst the immediate value of stolen goods may seem modest, the cumulative loss to retailers is substantial. Moreover, the psychological impact on victims—particularly retail workers tasked with confronting theft—must not be underestimated. The Retail Workers’ Union submitted a signal letter highlighting the distress caused by repeated thefts, noting increased staff turnover and absenteeism as a consequence.  

Your conduct was not confined to mere opportunism, and culpability is elevated by the steady nature of your offending, executed despite prior community resolutions and formal warnings. Similarly, the approach of your local council’s Safer Neighbourhood Team involved proactive engagement with you, offering support through outreach and diversionary opportunities which were declined or met with inconsistent participation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

The delay in the proceedings, occasioned by necessary psychiatric assessments and attendant Legal Aid agency authorisations, must also be acknowledged by the court. It is a matter of regret that repeated applications were required before approval was granted for the instruction of an independent forensic psychologist, a process which extended the timeline by several months. Cases such as this highlight systemic inefficiencies within our criminal justice support frameworks, a matter currently under review by the Ministry of Justice Reform Committee.  

The present assessment was conducted by Dr Olivia Broad, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, whose report was filed on 12 September 2025. Her analysis, based on detailed interviews and psychometric testing, concludes that although no enduring psychiatric illness was diagnosed, there are notable difficulties with impulse control, emotional regulation, and stress tolerance which complicate compliance and increase risk of re-offending absent structured support.  

It is, perhaps, worthwhile to note in passing that the Probation Service in this jurisdiction continues to operate under significant strain, with frequent staff turnover and high caseloads. The impact of these pressures is deserving of formal comment. Probation officers must now navigate a landscape of heightened demand and fewer resources, often tasked with managing complex cases including mental health concerns, substance misuse, and housing instability. This systemic context, while not an excuse, is critical in understanding the challenges inherent in preparing comprehensive pre-sentence reports and supervising community orders.  

An instructive comparator can be found in R v. Stenson [2018] EWCA Crim 351, a case involving repeated thefts from supermarkets by an individual suffering from borderline personality disorder. The Court noted the importance of psychiatric input to frame sentencing options appropriately, balancing risk and rehabilitation without undue reliance on custodial sentences where community treatment could suffice.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Returning to the facts here, your offending was characterised by repeated entries into various retail premises, with evidence of preparatory behaviour such as the concealment of items in clothing or bags, and the use of distractions aimed at sales staff. Several victims have provided statements attesting to the emotional impact of these visits, describing a growing sense of vulnerability and anxiety.  

It is also pertinent to acknowledge, with some regret, that during the course of the police investigation a co-defendant was involved who failed to attend court and remains at large, a matter under ongoing enforcement. It should be clear that this individual’s conduct is wholly separate from yours, and you bear no responsibility for their failure to engage with the justice process, save insofar as it relates to ancillary matters of evidential linkage.  

The court is aware that on occasion, matters of administrative procedure are complicated by such co-defendant scenarios. The presence of multiple accused, with varying levels of culpability and differing pleas, complicates case management and evidentiary clarity. It is not unusual for co-defendants to present conflicting narratives or for their unrelated offences to receive judicial attention in co-joined hearings.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

I will now address the victim impact evidence before the court. Statements supplied by the proprietors and employees of pharmacies and small retailers detail the economic losses, heightened security measures implemented in response to ongoing losses, and the intangible but very real stress experienced by staff required to confront suspicion and loss repeatedly. One manager reported the necessity of installing additional CCTV cameras and revising staff rotas to reduce lone working during high-risk times. These measures, while necessary, incur financial and operational burdens falling ultimately on the community.  

It is also noted that no physical violence was perpetrated during the offences in question; however, the pervasive atmosphere of intimidation and subtle coercion exerted in some instances underlines the seriousness of the impact upon victims and staff.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

A focus on the practical consequences of your actions reveals a broader context of social and economic hardship. A report received from the Southwark Homeless Outreach Team describes your current accommodation as “temporary, unstable and vulnerable to disruption.” The report further indicates that you have declined several offers of support relating to financial and housing advice — services that are in increasingly short supply in inner London boroughs as budgets shrink and demand surges.  

The Circle Community Trust, a charity operating in several South London boroughs assisting individuals caught in cycles of poverty and crime, has submitted a letter noting their prior contact with you and the limits of their engagement. Volunteers expressed concern that despite repeated offers of assistance with budgeting and job seeking, sustained participation was not forthcoming.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

In an effort to gain insight into your background, the court has considered letters from family members and acquaintances which variously describe episodes of childhood instability, periods of homelessness, and interruption in educational attainment. While this material adds color to the backdrop of your life, it does not mitigate responsibility. It is a settled principle that difficult early experiences may contextualise but do not excuse criminal conduct.  

Nor, as emphasised in R v. Holloway [2020] EWCA Crim 1768, does the invocation of social disadvantage abrogate the duty to uphold the law or diminish the requirement for personal accountability. Courts must navigate carefully between recognition of systemic disadvantage and the imperative to impose proportionate and effective sanctions.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The court pauses to record its appreciation for the work of the Southwark Business Crime Reduction Partnership, whose efforts to coordinate intelligence, liaise with retailers, and contribute to victim impact statements demonstrate a sustained commitment to community safety in the face of constrained budgets and competing priorities. That such partnerships operate at all is a testament to the dedication of local officers and volunteers, even as these schemes are often hamstrung by limited staffing and inconsistent funding streams.  

It is relevant to observe that this case, despite its challenges, benefited from relative procedural stability. The listing of hearings proceeded within the indicative timeframes prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Rules, albeit with some interruptions occasioned by specialist report requests and defence instructions.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

I must take a moment to address the issue of Legal Aid administration. The repeated delays in authorising funding for expert reports, while attributable in part to procedural safeguards necessary to prevent misuse, nonetheless impose significant costs on the timely administration of justice. As seen nationwide, delays of months for forensic psychological assessment approvals frustrate efforts to advance cases efficiently and impose additional burdens on court resources and parties alike. It remains an open question for policy makers and funders how best to reconcile fiscal prudence with the imperative to support defendants’ rights under article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  

The imposition of a custodial sentence is not considered lightly. That said, in sustained acquisitive offending where prior warnings have failed to deter further conduct, and where the cumulative harm to victims and the broader community is demonstrable, immediate custody is often the unavoidable conclusion. Community orders and suspended sentences have their place, particularly where engagement with support services can be anticipated and supervision is feasible. Here, that engagement has been inconsistent at best.  

Your lack of meaningful compliance with outreach initiatives, refusal or withdrawal from voluntary support schemes, and repetition of offending despite clear consequences, undermine confidence in non-custodial sanctions as a standalone measure in this instance.  

Looking to parallel cases, R v. Chapman [2022] EWCA Crim 1557 involved serial shoplifting from multiple independent retailers. While the defendant engaged positively with probation and underwent cognitive behavioural therapy, a custodial sentence was nonetheless deemed appropriate to reflect the need for deterrence. In contrast, R v. Bellamy [2023] EWCA Crim 1018 considered the early guilty plea and sustained engagement with support services a mitigating factor warranting a community order.  

In your case, I am mindful that your plea, while not immediate, was entered before trial, a feature which will be accounted for in mitigation but does not excuse the prior delay.  

The court also notes that you are currently 34 years old with four previous convictions for similar offending. You live in unstable housing arranged via local authority emergency placement. There is no evidence of gang involvement, coercion, or complicity in more serious criminality. Although personal difficulties exist, they reflect circumstances experienced by many who do not embark on a path of criminal conduct.  

I invite your legal representative to make submissions on sentence.  

(SUBMISSIONS FROM DEFENCE AND CROWN RECORDED)  

In conclusion, I shall direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared. Given your profile and the nature of the offending, I ask the probation officer to consider all relevant community interventions, including cognitive skills programmes, drug and alcohol treatment options if applicable, and structured unpaid work components alongside possible requirements addressing financial management. Arrangements for enhanced supervision post-release or orders should also be envisaged, should custody be imposed.  

Sentencing will be determined upon receipt and consideration of the aforementioned report. The court will also entertain any further representations from both parties at that stage.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 19 September 2025, at Southwark Crown Court in Court 4 before His Honour Judge W. J. Carmichael. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Questions of costs are reserved until the conclusion of proceedings.  

These are the orders of the court.
