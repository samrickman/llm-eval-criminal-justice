IN THE CROWN COURT AT NEWCASTLE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. N2025/13287  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. Ellery  
Filed: 14 September 2025

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentencing consequent upon your conviction for theft, constituting shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct which has brought you within the jurisdiction of this court spans a period from early 2023 until April of this year, encompassing multiple retail premises across the metropolitan area of Newcastle and its adjacent boroughs.

Procedural History  
This matter was initially commenced by way of report from a series of retail partners participating in the Newcastle Business Crime Initiative (NBCI), a collaborative arrangement intended to foster information-sharing and coordinated responses to acquisitive crime targeting small and medium enterprises. Your apprehension followed an extended inquiry involving the joint efforts of the Northumbria Police Retail Theft Unit, the Municipal Forensic Analytics Service, and staff at a number of implicated stores. The resultant investigatory activity incurred considerable public expense, with data analysis and manual collation of evidential materials occupying significant manpower over a duration of some weeks.  
It is regrettable but nonetheless true that cases of this nature routinely place considerable pressure upon police resources. This is exacerbated by the shrinking budgets and personnel shortages which afflict many local forces in contemporary times. Front-line officers often find themselves diverted from other pressing priorities, such as the investigation of serious assaults, domestic violence matters, and threats of organised criminal activity, to concentrate on property crimes that rank as minor in terms of immediate harm but no less significant in terms of cumulative community impact.

Following your arrest on 12 May 2025, you were conducted through a suite of investigative procedures including a forensic examination of clothing recovered from your residence, the results of which established a trace associative link to distinctive items identified in closed-circuit television footage. You were formally charged on 22 May 2025 with a single count representative of a series of thefts from various retail outlets. This consolidated indictment was brought before this Crown Court in accordance with the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, with the intent of expediting resolution and managing case preparation effectively.  
The BCM process, though designed to reduce delay and ensure dialogue between all parties, remains subject to systemic pressures arising from listing constraints and the ongoing challenges posed by court estate capacity. In this case, initial hearings were postponed on two occasions: once due to an administrative backlog linked to the unexpected unavailability of a designated Crown Prosecutor, and subsequently to allow the defence legal team sufficient time to secure instructions on psychiatric and social welfare reports relevant to sentencing.

I acknowledge at the outset the professionalism exhibited by all legal representatives engaged in these proceedings. Ms Elinor Standish appears for the Crown with exemplary diligence, and Mr Warren Fields has acted on your behalf from the outset under Legal Aid provision. It is, regrettably, necessary to register a degree of frustration at the repeated, albeit ultimately successful, applications for funding of expert reports, the consequences of which lengthened these proceedings significantly. The Legal Aid Agency’s scheduling and correspondence, as previously recorded in earlier hearings, proved to be a source of delay, a regrettable phenomenon that has grown increasingly common and disruptive to the administration of justice.

The court has received and considered a range of documentation in aid of sentencing, including statements from multiple store managers and a representative submission from the Newcastle Retail Association, which collectively seek to convey the broader impact of your offending. I have also received a pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Ms Sandra Ellerby and psychiatric evaluations authored by Dr Jonathan Muir, consultant forensic psychiatrist attached to Newcastle Mental Health Trust. Their input, detailed and courteous, substantially informs the court’s approach to the matters before it.

It is proper also to note the enduring pressures bearing on local health and social care infrastructure. The scarcity of mental health support services, protracted waiting lists for community interventions, and the shrinking economic safety net have coalesced to pose significant challenges for individuals such as yourself, who grapple with structural disadvantage. Such contextual factors are not determinative, but they cannot be ignored. We live in a time of pronounced austerity, where voluntary organisations attempt to fill the void left by declining public provision. Agencies such as the Community Outreach Support Network, operating in the West End district, have contributed correspondence endorsing measured community-based intervention — though their capacity is stretched thin by demand.

The court has also reviewed case law bearing on similar offending patterns and sentencing principles. While many precedents relate to offences differing in gravity or context, they collectively illustrate the judiciary’s evolving stance on offences involving persistent retail theft and the delineation between custodial and community-based disposals.

One recalls, for example, the authorities flowing from R v. Longridge [2018] EWCA Crim 874, where the Court of Appeal examined sentencing proportionality in respect of repeated theft targeting convenience stores resulting in physical damage to property and heightened victim distress. Though the factual matrix involved damage not present here, the decision emphasised an escalated approach where offending represents a sustained breach of public trust. Similarly, R v. Seaton [2020] EWCA Crim 529 upheld immediate custody for a prolific shoplifter whose offences prompted significant economic and psychological hardship on small business operators.

Importantly, these authorities underscore the principle that persistent acquisitive conduct, marked by calculations to avoid detection and disregard for prior warnings, attracts sentences reflecting its multiplicative harm on victims and the community. Yet the court must balance deterrence, denunciation, rehabilitation prospects, and individual mitigation factors — a balance which is inherently case-specific.

It is neither my purpose nor this judgment’s scope to catalogue or summarise every legal authority cited by learned counsel; instead, I acknowledge their extensive efforts in drawing attention to the relevant law and guiding principles according to which this sentence must be determined.

Turning now to the particulars of your offending:

Your conduct displays a degree of planning, familiarity with store layouts, and calculated opportunism that removes it from the terrain of spontaneous lapses. This is underscored by your utilisation of distra... (the transcript was paused here for insertion of fact snippet 3).

These actions elucidate a pattern which several witness statements note induced a sense of vulnerability and anxiety among staff — some of whom altered working hours or navigated increased emotional strain as a consequence.

Statements from employ... store employees reveal the cumulative toll that persistent shoplifting exerts on frontline retail staff: feelings of fear, stress, and in some cases, the request to alter shifts or relocate temporarily to avoid confrontations. The economic impact, while individual incidents were low value, aggregated to a significant loss and operational disruption.

The Crown has noted, and the court recognises, the series of warnings and community resolution attempts previously afforded to you through local policing schemes. Despite this, subsequent offending occurred within a matter of months, regrettably undermining confidence in informal diversionary efforts.

Regarding psychiatric input, Dr Muir’s expert report, dated 2 September 2025, offers a detailed analysis of your mental health status. He opines that whilst no severe psychiatric disorder is evident, traits of impulsivity, intermittent depressive symptoms, and low self-esteem feature prominently. There is no evidence of psychosis or formal personality disorder, but mild substance misuse — primarily involving overuse of alcohol in periods of distress — complicates your presentation. His view is that engagement with structured psychological intervention, including cognitive-behavioural therapy specifically targeting impulsivity and coping mechanisms, would be beneficial. Dr Muir also recommends exploration of psychosocial support focused on stabilization of housing and employment status, which aligns with the probation officer’s observations.  
Ms Ellerby’s probation report, compiled following a comprehensive interview and collateral enquiries, presents a balanced risk assessment. It affirms a moderate likelihood of reoffending in the absence of robust intervention, citing your unstable accommodation, non-engagement with support services, and unresolved financial pressures as factors of concern. Conversely, it identifies protective elements such as your limited criminal history outside acquisitive crime and some expressed motivation toward change — though this remains equivocal. The report indexes a need for multi-agency collaboration involving mental health services, housing support, and debt advice, as essential components of any rehabilitative endeavour.  
The voluntary sector’s submissions, including those from the Newcastle Small Business Forum and the Citizens Advice Bureau team working within the East End, respectfully urge a sentence structure which preserves engagement and allows for restorative opportunities. They express awareness of the wider societal challenges — including an acute local shortage of affordable housing, rising unemployment, and increasing reliance on food banks — arguing that effective community sentencing with structured support offers better prospects for lasting change than immediate custody.

It would be remiss to overlook the increasingly visible social changes affecting our urban environment. There is no question that the steady growth of street homelessness, intensified by the economic fallout from the post-pandemic period and cost-of-living crisis, has altered the public landscape irreversibly. The public and institutional tolerance for visible deprivation varies, but it remains the task of the courts to take account of the complex human realities behind the statistics without losing sight of the necessity of accountability.  
On occasion, the court encounters cases of criminal damage within local communities which, while unrelated to the present facts, illustrate the insidious effects of antisocial behaviour. For example, R v. Fenwick [2017] EWCA Crim 993, concerned a defendant convicted of criminal damage to public transport infrastructure through graffiti and defacement. The court there emphasised the far-reaching consequences of such acts in eroding public confidence and damaging community resources. Though entirely unrelated, such authorities underscore the broader context of property offences within societal fabric.  
Similarly, cases involving possession of bladed articles near schools, such as R v. Collins [2019] EWCA Crim 455, have demonstrated the judiciary’s firm stance against the endangerment of children and youth, an issue of heightened sensitivity though unrelated here.

Delays in this case, as noted, were occasioned by required expert evaluations and Legal Aid authorisations. Such procedural impediments are a feature of the modern criminal justice system and serve as a reminder that efficiency, while a paramount concern, must sometimes yield to the demands of fairness and thoroughness.  
The court also recognises that the pressure on probation services nationally is well documented, with workforce shortages and increasing caseloads challenging effective supervision. The recent government review of the National Probation Service highlighted these difficulties, noting that sustained investment is necessary to preserve rehabilitative and supervisory capacity. The hope in cases such as this is that available probation resources can be deployed in a targeted fashion to support individuals who, like you, face multi-faceted difficulties.

Before turning to sentence, I have considered the victim impact material tendered on behalf of the retailers. The economic loss, disruption to staffing, and attendant psychological consequences are non-trivial. While no violence or threat was involved, the fear, mistrust, and devaluation of workplace safety experienced by employees is reflected in the documented statements. Such harm, while often invisible in monetary terms, legitimately informs the seriousness assessment in sentencing.

Having weighed all these considerations, I reiterate that your lack of engagement with services, despite multiple offers of support, is regrettable and limits options for dispositional leniency. The court’s duty is to respond to offending with a view to public protection, personal rehabilitation, and upholding societal norms.

In relation to sentencing options, the sentencing guidelines for theft offences recommend considering the value of goods stolen, the frequency and persistence of offending, and the impact on victims and community. While your case involves relatively low unit value per incident, the frequency and pattern supports an elevated approach. Mitigating factors such as remorse, plea timing, and personal circumstances point towards calibrated measures rather than automatic custody. Your guilty plea—though late—is noted with limited weight in recognition of the timing and circumstances under which it was entered.

It is appropriate now to request a full pre-sentence report which addresses the suitability of community sentences incorporating tailored rehabilitative interventions. This may include cognitive skills courses, mental health treatment programmes, accommodation support, and financial advice components. Any proposal should also address compliance measures to promote accountability.  
It remains open to the court to impose custodial sentence should the report indicate that community measures offer insufficient public protection or risk management.

I will adjourn this matter for sentencing on 12 November 2025, pending receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further representations from the parties. Copies of all relevant records and assessments shall be forwarded to probation promptly to facilitate a full and informed report.

Before concluding, I wish to record my gratitude to the court staff who have maintained order and efficiency in what has been a lengthy and at times complex proceeding. The recently refurbished courtroom facilities are a credit to the Crown Court’s commitment to providing a dignified and accessible space for justice.  
I also acknowledge the often unheralded work of retail crime prevention officers and support workers who engage tirelessly with vulnerable populations, including those caught in cycles of acquisitive offending. Their efforts—while often unseen—are vital to the functioning of the justice ecosystem and the promotion of public safety.

In closing, this court is, as ever, mindful of its twin responsibilities: to the wider community seeking reassurance that offending does not go unchecked, and to individuals before it who require justice tempered with judgment and opportunity for reform.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Newcastle. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal against conviction and sentence within 28 days in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Unless otherwise ordered, no reporting restrictions are currently engaged. There will be no order as to costs.

These are the orders of the court.
