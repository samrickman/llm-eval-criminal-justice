IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTFORD  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13478  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge B. N. STRATFORD  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence after having pleaded guilty to a representative charge of theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to a series of shoplifting offences across multiple retail premises within the Hartford and surrounding boroughs over a period spanning from late 2023 to early 2025.

Procedural History  
Your initial appearance on summons was recorded at Hartford Magistrates’ Court on 18 March 2025. The matters were swiftly remitted to this court due to the persistent and serial nature of the offending, reflecting a pattern of conduct that the magistrates rightly considered warranted sentencing at Crown Court level. The transfer procedure proceeded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 11, without contest.

It is appropriate at the outset to observe the procedural pathway taken in this case, which is notable for adherence to the guidelines and indicative timeframes prescribed under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework. This initiative, established in 2017 to improve case progression and offender management, seeks to reduce delays, ensure early identification of appropriate sentencing options, and better manage witness availability and disclosure.

The first plea and trial preparation hearing was held in Court 5 on 14 April 2025, with defence initially indicating a not guilty plea, prompting preliminary exchange of evidence and forensic material. A further pre-sentence review was scheduled for 22 June 2025, during which you confirmed your intention to change your plea to guilty, following disclosure of additional CCTV footage and corroborative witness accounts. The late change necessitated an adjournment to allow defence submissions to be considered and the preparation of a psychiatric report.

These procedural steps were not without some difficulty. At various junctures, the court noted delays caused by the sluggish processing of Legal Aid applications, particularly the application to instruct an independent forensic psychologist with expertise in acquisitive offending and impulsivity disorders. Despite persistence by your instructed solicitor, Mr Edward Marks of Radcliffe Chambers, final authority from the Legal Aid Agency was only granted after repeated correspondence stretching over six weeks. Such delays regrettably diminish the procedural efficiency that the justice system must strive to uphold and increase strain on all parties concerned.

The court also places on record its gratitude to Ms Tabitha Gibbons, prosecuting counsel, whose prepared and measured submissions contributed to the orderly conduct of proceedings. Legal representatives for all parties ensured thorough disclosure and collaboration despite the challenging administrative landscape in which criminal justice practitioners currently operate.

A final sentencing hearing was listed for today, 14 September 2025, without further adjournments. The courtroom, recently refurbished and maintained to high standards by the court services team, provided a suitable venue for these important deliberations.

I must note that the court is increasingly concerned by the cumulative pressures affecting the Probation Service in this jurisdiction. Staffing shortages, escalating caseloads, and limited availability of suitable rehabilitative programmes for individuals convicted of acquisitive offences persist. This systemic shortfall complicates efforts to provide structured and effective interventions aimed at reducing recidivism and safeguarding the community.

Similarly, the capacity constraints affecting NHS mental health services—especially community-based support for individuals presenting with impulsivity or low mood disorders—remain acute. Waiting times for appointments with clinical psychologists and psychiatrists often extend into many months, challenging attempts to provide timely clinical assessment and management in the criminal justice context.

Community organisations such as the Hartford Business Crime Reduction Partnership (HBCRP) have played a vital role in collating intelligence and supporting victim businesses. Those efforts merit mention given their importance for prosecutorial efficacy and victim welfare. However, like many voluntary sector bodies, the HBCRP faces a funding environment marked by uncertainty and resource constraints.

Culturally, the court recognises ongoing debates about the societal factors underpinning acquisitive crime, including economic precarity, housing insecurity, and social dislocation. While such factors necessarily form the context within which offending occurs, they cannot excuse or diminish personal responsibility. Courts administer justice on the basis of conduct and culpability, informed by but not subsumed in structural explanations.

It is therefore incumbent on this court to impose a sentence that reflects not only the nature and seriousness of your offending but also the wider interests of public protection, prevention, and rehabilitation.

Legal Context  
The offence before the court is framed within the established parameters of the Theft Act 1968, with particular reference to section 1, defining theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive.

The Sentencing Council guidelines (2023) relating to theft offences classify shoplifting in the context of persistent, planned offending as generally falling into a higher culpability category than opportunistic or single-incident offences. Aggravating factors include repeated offending, targeting vulnerable premises or individuals, use of concealment methods, and prior cautions or convictions.

Case law continues to evolve in relation to sentencing principles applicable in acquisitive crime. In R v. Dawson [2024] EWCA Crim 1027, the Court of Appeal affirmed that sentences must reflect the cumulative harm caused by serial offending, even when individual incidents might seem minor. The court underscored the importance of deterrence, both general and individual.

Similarly, R v. Telford [2023] EWCA Crim 2114 addressed the assessment of credit for guilty pleas, reiterating that the timing and context of the plea are critical. A plea entered after full evidence disclosure but prior to trial commencement may attract some reduction, but not as much as one entered at the earliest opportunity.

Additional references include R v. Chambers [2022] EWCA Crim 1533, which emphasised the necessity to consider the impact on victims, particularly retail workers experiencing repeated targeting, and R v. Patel [2021] EWCA Crim 1916, discussing sentencing in the context of mental health considerations alongside persistent acquisitive offending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

A detailed overview of the behaviour reflected in the indictment reveals a course of conduct marked by deliberate concealment of goods, coordination of movements to avoid detection, and willingness to revisit premises following warnings or informal interventions. Such factors elevate the seriousness beyond mere opportunism.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

Among the items taken were restricted over-the-counter medicines and high-value personal care products, known both for resale potential and for their essential role to vulnerable consumers. Staff reports indicate heightened levels of anxiety, with one keyholder describing “a palpable sense of fear” whenever you were present in their store.

Notably, there was no direct use of force or threats. Nonetheless, the repeated incursions fostered a climate in which employees felt compelled to modify their working patterns, including reductions in lone working shifts and increased security presence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

A further aggravating feature was your apparent use of layered clothing and bags designed to thwart detection, indicative of planning and awareness of consequences. Security personnel consistently observed behavioural markers typical of experienced offenders, such as deliberate distraction techniques, including feigning phone calls and engaging other shoppers.

In one instance, a member of staff reported observing you deliberately set off store alarms while exiting, appearing indifferent to the consequences, a tactic presumably aimed at concealment within a crowd.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Moreover, you were apprehended wearing a distinctive cap unused in other contexts but visible on CCTV footage across multiple incidents, facilitating identification. Your reluctance to engage meaningfully with diversionary schemes was noted by prevention officers involved.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

The Economic and Social Research Council has recently noted that acquisitive crime remains a persistent challenge in urban retail environments, particularly where social inequalities intersect with limited access to support services. While such macro trends bear no direct legal relevance, their policy implications inform the systemic context within which offending occurs and is managed.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

The court also reflects on the impact upon small business owners, for whom repeated shoplifting can pose existential threats. Several victim impact statements submitted on behalf of independent retailers described increased insurance premiums, investment in additional security measures, and diminished morale among staff.

Such effects not only impose financial burdens but also corrode community cohesion. It is a matter of public interest that these harms be recognised and addressed through proportionate sentencing.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Repeated attempts by the prosecutor to offer diversion into community penalty programmes, including cognitive behavioural therapy tailored to offending cognition, were declined or ignored until charges were laid.

Expert Reports and Deferral Requests  
The psychiatric report provided by Dr. Marianne Coates, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at Hartford Community Mental Health Trust, was comprehensive. Dr Coates notes that you present with traits indicative of impulsive behaviour and tendencies toward transient low mood but do not meet criteria for a diagnosable major psychiatric illness.

Her observations include an “absence of overt psychosis, bipolarity or substance-induced disorder.” She recommends consideration of structured psychological support focusing on impulsivity management and cognitive remediation but emphasises that such interventions carry no guarantee of engagement or success.

Provisional pre-sentence reports from Probation Officer Ms Leila Freeman highlight medium risk of reoffending and suggest the possible utility of rehabilitation activity requirements alongside unpaid work modules. Ms Freeman expresses concern regarding your limited engagement with referral pathways offered post-arrest.

The court notes correspondence from the Legal Aid Agency acknowledging recent difficulties in processing applications for expert involvement in cases touching on mental health vulnerabilities among offenders. There is a clear imperative for systemic improvement to prevent adverse impacts on case progression and to uphold defendants’ rights to timely assessments.

In the absence of compelling mitigating psychiatric findings, this case stands for the court as primarily a matter calling for firm but proportionate sentencing, with a focus both on deterrence and rehabilitation.

Legal Aid and Systemic Observations  
Documents before the court include a letter dated 28 May 2025 from the national Legal Aid Committee, acknowledging “significant backlogs” in authorising forensic reports in Crown Court matters and undertaking to allocate additional resources. While this development is welcome, such systemic limitations are cause for professional concern.

The court also received statements from a local homelessness charity, Hearthstone Support Services, expressing ongoing operational pressures exacerbated by recent funding cuts. These letters reflect a wider societal context including increasing street homelessness and precarious living conditions which, while not determinative of individual culpability, constitute the backdrop to many cases seen here.

It is noteworthy that Hearthstone confirmed that you had declined multiple offers of support, including participation in budgeting and tenancy sustainment workshops.

In a separate note, the court acknowledges the high workload of digital forensic teams across the region, who have reported a backlog of cases involving retail thefts where mobile device analysis is required. These demands further pressure investigative capacities.

Other Matters of Context and Case Law  
I wish to refer briefly to a selection of appellate decisions that, while not directly analogous, provide context relevant to sentencing grid application:

R v. King [2020] EWCA Crim 3071 concerned a burglary involving forcible entry into a private home during occupants’ absence, which resulted in a three-year custodial sentence. Although burglary is distinct from shoplifting, the principles relating to harm and culpability remain informative.

R v. Barker [2019] EWCA Crim 2118 involved possession of a bladed weapon in a school car park, underscoring the courts’ concern with offences occurring proximal to vulnerable populations, a factor occasionally echoed in retail proximity due to concerns about youth clientele.

R v. Mackay [2021] EWCA Crim 1024 penalised persistent environmental damage caused by illegal dumping in protected areas. Though unrelated, these jurisprudential points illustrate judicial sensitivity to offences with cumulative impacts beyond immediate monetary loss.

In a related vein, it is necessary to distinguish your conduct from that of a co-defendant in a separate case heard recently in this circuit, who was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm following a late-night pub brawl involving pool cues. That conduct, featuring aggressive violence, attracted a significantly custodial outcome and carries no bearing here.

Similarly, your sibling’s ongoing criminal proceedings for benefit fraud are unrelated to your offending and shall not influence this court’s consideration.

Victim Impact and Community Harm  
Victim impact statements previously submitted describe the personal and business consequences of your offending. While no physical injuries were sustained, the emotional toll on retail employees was palpable: one shop manager described their staff as “walking on eggshells” during your presence, and another sought professional counselling due to anxiety.

Local business associations estimate that cumulative losses attributable to your course of offending exceed £1,200, an amount sufficient to strain already small profit margins.

Statements also include mention of increased security expenditures, loss of community goodwill, and a perceived erosion in the safety and welcome atmosphere within local shopping centres.

The court is mindful that such effects, while intangible, compound the direct financial costs and contribute materially to broader public detriment.

Defence Submissions and Mitigation  
Mr Edward Marks, acting on your behalf, submitted a precursory mitigation bundle, including letters from acquaintances describing a fluctuating employment history and family instability, though with limited evidence of sustained positive progression.

Defence counsel emphasised your current housing difficulties, although no fixed address was confirmed at the date of the hearing. It was further submitted that there was a lack of harm to persons and no suggestion of coercion or gang association.

The plea of guilty, entered before trial proper, is noted and carries a recognition of responsibility.

The court has considered the possibility of community resolution or conditional discharge, but finds the seriousness and pattern of conduct preclude such disposals.

Sentencing Considerations  
Balancing all relevant factors, this case presents an example of persistent acquisitive offending, amounting to a clear breach of trust and social responsibility. Your conduct reflects a conscious decision to engage in theft, to evade detection, and to continue offending despite prior warnings.

The purpose of sentencing is multifaceted: punishment for wrongdoing, deterrence (both individual and general), rehabilitation opportunities, and protection of the public.

While the absence of violence or threats is acknowledged, the cumulative harms caused to businesses and staff warrant a firm response.

Your personal circumstances—housing insecurity, possible impulsiveness—must be factored in, though as outlined, the refusal to engage with help significantly limits mitigation.

Sentencing options will be considered in the forthcoming formal hearing, following the preparation of a full pre-sentence report by the Nene Valley Probation Service. That report is requested to elaborate on tailored rehabilitation pathways, potential for restorative justice engagement, and risk assessment including any mental health or substance misuse factors.

At that time, the court will also be informed of any updated representations from victim support agencies or other stakeholders.

This is the sentencing direction you should anticipate.

These sentencing remarks are issued today, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at Hartford Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of their right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, section 49, are engaged at present. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
