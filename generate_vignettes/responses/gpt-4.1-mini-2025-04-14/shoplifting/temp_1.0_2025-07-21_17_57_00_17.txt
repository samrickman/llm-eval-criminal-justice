IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13847  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. R. LANGLEY  
Filed: 15 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence in respect of repeated offences of theft from retail premises, in contravention of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending occurred over an extended time frame, ranging from early 2023 through to March 2025, involving a variety of independent and chain retailers across the Bristol metropolitan area and adjoining localities.

Procedural History  
You were apprehended on 27 March 2025 following a comprehensive investigation carried out by the Bristol City Police Acquisitive Crime Unit, in conjunction with the Bristol Retail Crime Initiative (BRCI). The genesis of the inquiry lay in a pattern of escalating reports of theft from multiple outlets specialising in health and beauty products, personal care items, and convenience foods. Initial submissions to law enforcement tended to treat these incidents as isolated; however, the collation of security camera footage, till transaction audits, and bespoke forensic examination of items recovered from your person gave rise to a coherent prosecutorial case.  

Regrettably, cases such as these seldom progress smoothly or swiftly. The court is aware of the considerable administrative complexity involved in gathering and reviewing evidential material related to low-level crime — the repeated, incremental thefts that drain resources and demoralise retail staff, yet strain police capabilities. It is a striking paradox that offences involving items of comparatively modest financial value may occasion a disproportionate deployment of investigative effort. Among the challenges is the often opaque nature of CCTV footage, which despite significant technological advances, remains subject to recurrent issues of quality, angle, and circumspect coverage. Digital forensic teams labour for hours to extract usable frames amidst hours of grainy black-and-white data.  

In a similar vein, evidential challenges occasion procedural delays. Timeliness in disclosure and file management emerges as a perennial concern. It is to the credit of the officers and prosecutors in this case that progression adhered substantially to framework timelines under the Criminal Procedure Rules, notwithstanding unavoidable logistical complications. Your initial interview took place on 14 April 2025, under caution, during which you initially denied involvement. This denail persisted until shortly before your first appearance in Crown Court, when you tendered a plea of guilty to a consolidated charge representing the course of conduct under scrutiny.

A plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 8 May 2025, during which your defence counsel indicated an intention to seek expert psychiatric assessment and requested an adjournment to obtain further collateral information, including statements from family members and voluntary sector workers engaged in supporting clients facing economic hardship. The court endorsed the adjournment, and the matter was relisted for sentencing on today's date.

At the outset, I take the opportunity to acknowledge the participation of Ms Louise Mainwaring for the Crown and Mr Justin Keane QC for the defence. I note with some regret the delays occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency's protracted authorization process for the instructed psychiatric report, causing several weeks’ pendency that could, and should, have been avoided. These administrative obstructions have become an unwelcome but persistent feature, undermining not only the expediency of proceedings but the rights of defendants to timely assessment.

Letters of support have been submitted from employees at local community support organisations, including Bristol Haven and the City Food Bank, which attest to the vigilance, patience, and compassion exhibited by their volunteers amidst growing demand and constricted funding. Their continued efforts to engage vulnerable individuals in constructive interventions merit commendation.

The court is further reminded—by way of contextual comment and without implied relevance—that in R v. Crombie [2020] EWCA Crim 2150, a defendant with a history of homelessness and drug dependence was sentenced for an aggravated burglary involving the use of a weapon during a late-night intrusion, resulting in significant physical injury to a homeowner. Although the facts of Crombie are factually distant from the instant matter, the judgment underscored the pronounced aggravation attendant upon offences involving violence and vulnerability of victims. This serves as a touchstone illustrating the spectrum of culpability within property crime, whereby offences which do not involve confrontation or harm may nonetheless occasion serious emotional distress and wider social harms.

Similarly, in R v. Beecham [2018] EWCA Crim 1678, concerning fly-tipping of hazardous waste on protected farmland resulting in environmental contamination, the Court upheld a custodial sentence reflecting the offender's blatant disregard for regulatory frameworks and ecological preservation. That case, while peripheral, reaffirms the principle that the Law regards persistent breaches of communal trust with corresponding severity.

I further note, extraneous though it may be, the unrelated incident involving a co-defendant in a recent public order trial before this court, who was charged with affray after a bar fight involving improvised weapons such as pool cues and chairs. While the individual in question is not you, awareness of the varying forms and gravity of offences dealt with by the court is instructive in understanding judicial approaches to assessments of harm, mitigation, and sentencing consistency.

Legal Considerations  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the operative statute. The Theft Offences Definitive Guideline issued by the Sentencing Council is the controlling document for sentencing considerations here. It directs sentencing judges to weigh factors including but not limited to the duration and frequency of offending, use of planning or sophistication, impact upon victims and commercial operators, prior convictions, and the degree of remorse, including the timing of guilty pleas.

The timing and character of any plea remains a decisive factor in mitigation. Credit for programmes of early guilty pleas, particularly prior to trial and evidential assembly, may reduce sentences by up to a third. However, as reiterated in R v. Pearse [2019] EWCA Crim 820, late-stage pleas offered at the eve of trial attract increasingly reduced credits, reflecting their limited procedural advantage to the justice system and victims.

Analogous judgments include R v. Taggart [2022] EWCA Crim 1346, where a sentence of 12 months’ custody for repeated theft from a pharmacy chain was upheld, the Court noting the cumulative distress caused to staff and public confidence. While the facts are distinct, the principles have resonance in the current sentencing calculus.

The Defendant’s Background and Context  
You are now 34 years of age, with a prior record including three convictions for shoplifting dating back over the last seven years. You are presently unemployed and reside in a council-funded hostel accommodation on the outskirts of Bristol. You gave no indication of gang or organised crime involvement.

Pre-sentence and psychiatric reports were commissioned to assess relevant risk factors and identify suitable interventions. The report prepared by Dr Valerie Nkomo, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, is detailed and professionally composed. Dr Nkomo confirms the absence of diagnosable major psychiatric illness but highlights features consistent with impulsivity, traits of borderline personality disorder, and a probable mild dependence on alcohol. She notes your failure to engage voluntarily with community substance misuse services despite repeated offers.

The court recalls the ongoing and well-documented pressures on the National Health Service, particularly within mental health provision, where waiting lists for assessments and care have lengthened dramatically. These systemic challenges constrain capacity to provide early and comprehensive support to individuals
