IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/14523  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. BRADSHAW  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear today for sentence in respect of offences of theft by shoplifting committed over a sustained period, the precise nature of which will be outlined in due course. These offences fall under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, as amended by subsequent legislative updates including the Sentencing Act 2020 reforms. Your conduct was investigated and brought to charge following a multi-agency operation targeting a recurrent pattern of retail theft across Greater Manchester.  

Procedural Background  
Your case first came before this court on 5 August 2025, when you entered a not guilty plea. The Court noted that due to the multifaceted nature of the evidence to be considered — including detailed CCTV footage, witness statements, and electronic point-of-sale data — the anticipated trial date was set for late October, allowing adequate time for preparation. Following a successful application by your defence to instruct an independent psychiatric expert, authorized by the Legal Aid Agency on 20 August after protracted correspondence, the matter was adjourned to facilitate that assessment.  

The saga of securing authorisation for expert instruction revealed, yet again, the regrettable administrative bottlenecks afflicting the Legal Aid system. What should have been a straightforward process required multiple clarifications and resubmissions — a course of events lamentably familiar to this court and to many practitioners, as highlighted in the recent independent report by the Justice Efficiency Commission (JEC) of July 2025, which called for urgent reform. The delays occasioned by these bureaucratic obstacles are not mere inconveniences; they have profound effects on case management, fairness, and timely justice.  

Adjacent to your proceedings, it is worth noting a series of unrelated delays within nearby Crown Court centres arising from an industrial action undertaken by court ushers and clerks — a dispute over pay and working conditions concluded in July after 18 days of intermittent stoppages. The ripple effect from these disruptions was felt across the regional circuit, with multiple hearings postponed or abbreviated. That wider context neither excuses nor influences the current matter, but it serves as a reminder of the many pressures constraining the criminal justice system at present.  

The importance of multi-agency collaboration cannot be overstated in cases such as yours. The Greater Manchester Retail Crime Partnership (GM-RCP), of which the city's policing units and local council enforcement teams are key members, has adopted a strategy embracing data sharing, early intervention, and victim liaison. This modus operandi reflects the recommendations of the Home Office’s 2023 Retail Crime Strategy Review, which emphasises the necessity of co-operation among commercial and law enforcement entities to address repeat offending effectively. Here, the GM-RCP’s role extended to the collation of comprehensive incident reports — many of which were appended to the Crown’s case bundle — and coordinated victim impact statements that evidence the real-world effects of repeat shoplifting on small business communities.  

It is pertinent to mention that the Criminal Procedure Rules have undergone substantive amendments as of 1 April 2025, notably CPR 2.8 concerning early disclosure obligations and the Code of Practice for Victims (2024) incorporating enhanced victim consultation and communication protocols. These reforms have been met with both commendation and critique, particularly concerning their implication on case progression times and resource allocation. Yet they represent the prevailing legal framework within which this court must operate.    

The present case also brings to the fore the enduring difficulty in adjudicating offences which are often viewed through a simplistic lens by the public and media alike. Shoplifting, particularly when committed on multiple occasions, is more than mere petty mischief; it resonates deeply within affected communities, threatening small businesses’ viability and eroding confidence in local commerce. These are matters that the court must weigh judiciously alongside considerations of your personal circumstances.   

On 12 September 2025, following receipt of Dr Sheila Munroe’s comprehensive psychiatric evaluation report, your defence was permitted to serve further mitigation evidence, including a witness statement from your youngest sister, Ms Karen H, and several letters of support from St. Mark’s Community Food Bank and the local branch of the Manchester Homeless Outreach Project. The court is genuinely grateful for these materials. Staff from these voluntary organisations, operating under chronic underfunding and workforce shortages, provide invaluable assistance to vulnerable individuals and, in doing so, stabilize the fragile fabric of community safety. Their written communications were measured and appropriately balanced — emphasising both compassion and the non-negotiable requirement for accountability.     

I also acknowledge the representation provided by Mr James Atwood QC for the Crown and Ms Freya Lalonde for your defence. Both have conducted themselves with diligence, despite the challenges posed by a congested court list and the need to juggle competing professional commitments amid the ongoing disruptions caused by regional judicial reforms and probation service shortages.  

A point worthy of procedural note is the intermittent difficulty encountered with interpreting services in this jurisdiction. On two occasions, hearings were delayed because of late arrival of interpreters, a reflection of the stretched capacity that courts nationally continue to experience. While irrelevant in your case, these systemic pressures form the backdrop against which justice is administered and remind us of the very tangible human resource limitations currently confronted by public institutions.  

Substantive Legal Context  
The Theft Act 1968, while venerable, remains the cornerstone statute governing conduct such as the offences charged against you. Section 1 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive the owner of it. The judicial interpretation of “dishonesty” has evolved over time, with the seminal test set out in R v Ghosh [1982] QB 1053, though it was redefined more recently by the Supreme Court in Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67, which emphasised an objective standard informed by the defendant’s knowledge and state of mind.    

Sentencing practice is guided by the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Definitive Guideline (effective from March 2024). It categorises harm and culpability across gradations and emphasises that repeated offending aggravates sentence severity. The Guideline instructs courts to consider not only financial loss but also impact on victims’ psychological wellbeing, operational disruption, and community confidence.  

The jurisprudence provides additional guidance. For instance, in R v Saul [2019] EWCA Crim 231, the Court of Appeal upheld an immediate custodial sentence for a defendant who repeatedly shoplifted electronic gadgets over a six-month period, certifying that persistence and methodical targeting elevate culpability. In contrast, R v Manning [2021] EWCA Crim 647 clarified that individuals subject to genuine hardship and who engage positively with rehabilitative services might merit custodial sentences suspended in appropriate cases. Both cases, whilst not perfectly analogous to yours, inform the framework within which sentencing determinations are made.  

It would be remiss not to mention the prolific series of cases arising from “Operation Springvale,” a regional police initiative targeting organized retail crime rings active since 2023. These prosecutions have highlighted the complexity of disentangling offences involving multiple co-defendants, use of concealment technology, and counterfeit goods. None of those enhanced aggravating features are present in your case; however, the existence of such contemporaneous prosecutions reflects the wider environment in which retail theft is prosecuted, and it illustrates that this court remains vigilant to both individual and organised manifestations of acquisitive crime.  

The facts which underpin your conviction are as follows, as presented by the Crown and accepted by your late plea.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

You should understand that the court approaches the facts with seriousness and recognition of the public harm involved. The practice of shoplifting, particularly when persistent, is not a victimless crime. The retail sector, especially smaller independent shops, suffers cumulative losses and often experiences increased security costs, which may in turn affect prices and community economic wellbeing.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

This court is conscious of testimony from store personnel who provided impact statements. Their accounts describe heightened anxiety, interrupted work practices, and fear of future encounters. These human elements, although not quantifiable in monetary terms, are nonetheless profoundly consequential.   

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

At sentencing, the court is required to balance these factors against any mitigating circumstances you may present.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

The medical evidence presented by Dr Munroe is detailed and professionally composed. Her opinion — informed by standardized assessments, clinical interviews, and collateral information — identifies a diagnosis of moderate depressive disorder exacerbated by social instability and unresolved familial conflict.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

Despite the presence of diagnosed mental health difficulties, the report does not indicate any significant cognitive impairment or psychosis which would undermine your ability to understand the nature and consequences of your actions. This is consistent with the findings in R v Kennedy [2020] EWCA Crim 892, where the Court of Appeal restated that mental disorder alone does not suffice to negate culpability or justify custodial leniency unless closely connected to the offence itself.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

Your previous record reveals a regrettable persistence with acquisitive offences. You have been convicted on five separate prior occasions for theft-related offences, including three prior shoplifting convictions, and one breach of a community order dated 2021 for similar conduct. Despite involvement with probation and various voluntary support programmes, your offending resumed and escalated. Such recidivism is a significant aggravating factor in sentencing, as it indicates a failure to respond to previous interventions.  

It is acknowledged, however, that your personal circumstances are challenging. You are currently unemployed, residing in temporary accommodation granted through emergency housing allocations following family breakdown, and you have no dependent children in your care. Correspondence from the Manchester Homeless Outreach Project attests to your irregular engagement with their services but acknowledges your expressed willingness to adhere to suggested plans should you receive suitable support.  

Despite the growing pressures on social services, community provision, and mental health care, which are well-documented in official reports such as the NHS England Mental Health Workforce Strategy (September 2024), timely access to coordinated assistance remains limited. The court regrets that these public health challenges often create systemic gaps through which vulnerable individuals slip and reoffend.  

A number of relevant policy concerns loom large in the background of your case. The ongoing national conversation about street-level acquisitive crime underscores societal tensions regarding poverty, enforcement priorities, and proportionality of punishment. That dialogue is complex and ongoing.  

I am reminded also of a recent adult safeguarding referral report dated 22 August 2025, submitted to this court by the Manchester Safeguarding Adults Board. That document highlighted a disproportionate rise in non-violent acquisitive offences committed by adults experiencing social exclusion, mental health difficulties, and housing precarity. Inter-agency cooperation, shared risk assessments, and tailored intervention pathways are recommended pillars of response. The court encourages supervision services to heed such guidance to reduce reoffending and promote rehabilitation.  

It is important to note that there have been no allegations or findings in relation to use or possession of bladed articles, offences of violence, or drug supply in association with your offending — matters that often significantly influence sentencing outcomes and risk categorisations.  

The broader societal context is not lost on this court. Increasing pressures on housing, welfare provision, and community support services create environments in which repeated low-level offending may thrive. Yet we are bound to maintain a principled stance: criminal conduct cannot be excused solely by systemic failure.  

Sentencing Framework and Considerations  
The Sentencing Council’s guidelines place your offending in a Category 2C culpability bracket, with harm assessed at Category 2, given the sustained nature of the thefts over multiple premises and adverse impact on staff morale and local businesses. Previous sentencing remarks in comparable cases, including those in R v Carter [2022] EWCA Crim 1178 and R v Simmons [2023] EWCA Crim 523, provide instructive examples of the scope of penalty ranges that may be applied here.  

That said, your admission and plea at this stage attract some mitigation, albeit in reduced measure compared with early pleas. The principles established in R v Ross [2020] EWCA Crim 1541 caution against undue leniency where pleas are substantially delayed to the point where they merely circumvent contest at trial rather than evince genuine remorse. Other relevant factors include your mental health status, social instability, and evidence of partial engagement with voluntary support, which may weigh in favour of a community-oriented solution.  

I have carefully considered the reports provided by probation and independent experts; the victim impact statements; the submissions by counsel; and the policy guidance currently in force.  

I will direct a pre-sentence report to be prepared, with particular attention paid to the feasibility of a structured rehabilitative order incorporating cognitive behavioural therapy, mental health support, and financial management assistance. The probation service is also asked to consider any prospect of unpaid work as a restorative dimension. Given the absence of aggravating violence or weapons offences, and your expressed willingness to engage when facilitated appropriately, a custodial sentence is not predetermined.  

However, I must also express concern regarding the risks posed by repeated offending despite previous interventions. Any future disposition must strike a careful balance between public protection, deterrence, and your own rehabilitation.  

I thank all parties involved in this case. Particular appreciation is extended to the staff of the Manchester Retail Crime Partnership for their thorough collation of evidence and victim liaison work, the probation officers who have assisted with early assessments, and the voluntary sector agencies supporting you at present. Their dedication in the face of rising demand and limited resources is commendable.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. Proceedings have been conducted in open court and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentencing will be transmitted to relevant authorities forthwith. You are informed of your statutory right of appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs shall be reserved pending further directions.  

These are the orders of the court.
