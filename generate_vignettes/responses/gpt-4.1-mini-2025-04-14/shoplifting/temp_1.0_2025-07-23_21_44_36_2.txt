IN THE CROWN COURT AT WALTHAMSTOW  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. WT2025/13456  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L. RANDALL  
Filed: 12 August 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing on a representative charge of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The course of conduct underpinning this charge spans a period from September 2023 through March of this year, involving multiple incidents across the borough of Walthamstow and adjacent local authority areas. The offending is characterised by repeated and opportunistic appropriation of goods from several convenience and pharmacy outlets.

Procedural History  
Your initial appearance in this court was on 3 April 2025 following your arrest on 1 April that year. The arrest came as the culmination of an intelligence-led policing operation jointly coordinated by the Waltham Forest Safer Neighbourhood Team and the Retail Crime Partnership. The joint approach sought to tackle a significant increase in shop theft offences witnessed in the local commercial centres throughout late 2023 and early 2025, which had reached a level judged by the Business Crime Task Force as unsustainable. The surveillance and subsequent investigative work required the pooling of CCTV footage from multiple sources, retail staffing records, and electronic payment audits. The sheer volume of material—exceeding 14,000 frames of video and more than 600 pages of logs—speaks to the complexity of assembling a coherent evidential narrative in cases of this nature. It serves to emphasise how rogues’ gallery justice is far from the reality; what transpires instead is laborious data collation and painstaking witness liaison.

This case is instructive of the challenges facing law enforcement in the current age of digital surveillance, where the omnipresence of recording technologies is both a boon and a burden. The time-consuming and resource-intensive process of reviewing inconsistent angles, correcting time stamp discrepancies, and excluding irrelevant bystanders presents a logistical nightmare for those charged with upholding the law. More critically, while the public may see only the headline of “shoplifting” or “retail theft,” the underpinning processes reveal a mosaic of overlapping responsibilities, from local authority licensing teams to regional policing specialists, each contributing fractions of effort within a constrained resource envelope.

It is also pertinent to note the broader societal pressures implicated in the rise of retail theft, as noted in myriad policy papers and parliamentary inquiries. The retail sector has long bemoaned the scourge of shrinkage, however, recent years have seen the confluence of austerity measures, inflationary pressures, and evolving consumer behaviours exacerbate the vulnerability of frontline staff and smaller independent trade outlets. The loss of not only money but also consumer confidence and employee wellbeing has been the subject of numerous reports, including the 2024 Retail Crime Review commissioned by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy.

Your case was the subject of a plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) on 12 May 2025. At that hearing, you pleaded not guilty, asserting that identification was mistaken and that you had been improperly associated with some incidents by virtue of circumstantial evidence. Defence counsel requested, however, that a psychiatric assessment be commissioned given reported episodes of anxiety and previous contact with mental health services. This plea was maintained following initial forensic disclosure.

The requirement for mental health assessment in trials arising from pleas of not guilty is often interwoven with the ambition of the courts to maintain both expediency and fairness. The Better Case Management (BCM) protocols, designed originally to reduce administrative burden and list congestion, have sought to streamline such assessments. Yet, they also exemplify a necessary tension between resource allocation and the duty to ensure that defendants with vulnerabilities receive treatment commensurate with their needs. The Mental Health Act 1983, as amended, alongside the Crown Court Sentencing Guidelines (2021 edition), inform both procedural and substantive interventions in these contexts.

Following determination that the weight of evidence rendered a trial inevitable, your plea was changed to guilty at the sentencing hearing on 10 August 2025. In doing so, you accepted responsibility for the full factual basis proffered by the prosecution.

It is important here to remark on the case law governing guilty plea credits. Section 144 of the Sentencing Act 2020, together with guidance in R v Abrahams [2020] EWCA Crim 1233, underscores that credit is not an automatic entitlement but rests on factors including timing, sincerity, and the degree to which the plea assists the court and witnesses. Your change of plea at the sentencing stage is, regrettably, somewhat late and will accordingly afford you limited mitigation.

Cases such as R v Proudfoot [2018] EWCA Crim 1414, which involved opportunistic shoplifting of snack foods and beverages from a convenience outlet in Birmingham, provide useful comparative material. There, the Court took a firm line against what was termed "persistently opportunistic" offending, despite the low value of goods involved, on account of the cumulative impact on retail businesses and the community. Although the sentencing range in Proudfoot was calibrated accordingly, the Court recognised complications arising from mental health issues, which were present to a much greater degree than in your case.

Similarly, R v Fisk [2019] EWCA Crim 1521 addressed repeat theft from charity shops involving a defendant with a history of substance misuse and hostility to engagement with support services. The offender was ultimately sentenced to 10 months custody with an extended community order for rehabilitation, notwithstanding the monetary value being under £100 per instance. While each case bears its own factual pattern, the court is mindful of the principles espoused therein, particularly with reference to deterrence and public protection.

Further, it would be remiss not to observe that the issue of legal funding for expert reports and ancillary counsel has increasingly come under pressure in recent years. The Legal Aid Agency has been criticised repeatedly for delays and bureaucratic hurdles that undermine the pace of fair trials. Your legal team’s application for approved funding to instruct a forensic psychologist was, regrettably, delayed by over six weeks pending additional paperwork, despite clear clinical indications set forth in a report from the East London Mental Health Trust dated 18 March 2025. Such delays, while external to the conduct of the parties, impact both case preparation and overall trial management.

The Pre-Sentence Report prepared by Probation Officer Ms Chloe Rennie, dated 6 August 2025, is comprehensive and revealing. It notes your history commencing with shoplifting and petty theft during adolescence and continuing with escalating frequency post-employment loss in late 2022. The report remarks on inconsistent engagement with available support services and your stated reluctance to participate fully with outreach interventions. Ms Rennie notes that you have a limited informal support network, relying principally on an estranged sibling with whom contact is sporadic.

It is well recognised across probation and criminal justice systems that sustained behavioural change is contingent upon an alignment of internal and external factors. The so-called 'What Works' literature, forming the basis for many rehabilitation programmes, identifies cognitive restructuring, enhancement of self-regulatory skills, and stable accommodation as pivotal. Your personal circumstances present significant challenge in this regard.

The court places on record its appreciation for the probation service’s efforts in collating evidence and providing measured assessment under trying circumstances. Staffing shortages and increasing caseloads have stretched probation teams across the region, as is widely documented in recent annual reports and parliamentary hearings. Nonetheless, the quality of the report remains sound and contributes meaningfully to this sentencing exercise.

It is also important to clarify matters unrelated to your specific conduct but which have emerged incidentally during this proceeding. For instance, a co-defendant arrested in conjunction with an ostensibly related fly-tipping offence at a neighbouring green belt area suffered from a range of unrelated charges, including illicit waste disposal, resulting in separate proceedings that have no bearing on your culpability or risk factors.

Additionally, the landlord of the premises from which a victim store operates is currently subject to enforcement action regarding a noise abatement notice, a matter which similarly is extraneous but has been referenced in the course of submissions by way of background.

The court has, moreover, been provided with correspondence from the Charity Shop Volunteer Association (CSVA), commending local businesses’ resilience in the face of acquisitive crime and highlighting their ongoing efforts to integrate trauma-informed practice in victim support. Their letters emphasise that while shoplifting offences may seem minor in scale, the psychological impact on often vulnerable retail workers is substantial and enduring.

Turning to psychiatric observations, a report prepared by Dr Matthew Chung, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at the East London Mental Health Trust, was commissioned following a section 2 assessment under the Mental Health Act. Dr Chung’s report dated 22 July 2025 concludes that while you do not meet threshold criteria for a mental disorder warranting treatment under the Act, there are indications of generalized anxiety disorder with intermittent depressive symptoms. There is no evidence of psychosis, bipolar affective disorder, or cognitive impairment. Dr Chung recommends consideration of cognitive behavioural therapy to address underlying anxiety, which, while contributory, does not absolve personal accountability.

The court is also mindful of the limitations presented by current NHS mental health service provision. Long waiting lists, understaffing, and resource constraints mean that timely access to psychological therapies is often problematic, a reality highlighted in the 2025 NHS England report on mental health service capacity. This systemic issue represents a challenge to all sectors involved in defendant rehabilitation.

It has been put to this court on your behalf that financial hardship, lack of stable accommodation, and substance use cumulatively contribute to your offending behaviour. While these factors may carry some weight in mitigation, it is incumbent to recognise that many individuals face similar difficulties yet choose lawful paths. The Magistrates’ Court Discharge and Diversion Scheme, aimed at providing intensive support to low-level offenders demonstrating vulnerability, was offered to you but declined or, according to probation notes, poorly engaged with.

The court must also take account of your previous convictions, of which there are a number, including four prior shoplifting convictions dating back to 2016 and 2018, as well as an incident involving possession of a bladed article in a school car park in 2019, which was dealt with in the Youth Court. These historical points speak to a pattern of acquired familiarity with the criminal justice process, thereby lessening the scope for mitigation based on inexperience or naivety.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

It should be noted that the Crown proffered victim impact statements from two affected stores: one a small pharmacy outlet and another a convenience store servicing a local community. Both statements articulate the consequential effect on staff morale, increased financial loss due to security enhancements, and the necessity to alter opening hours to mitigate risk. One manager described anxiety among staff felt when Mr H was known to be present, which led to staffing changes including the refusal to permit lone working during shifts coinciding with your visits.

The importance of victim impact material in sentencing cannot be overstated. It brings to life the human consequences of offences that might otherwise appear abstract or minor in the cold calculus of pounds and pence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

By the same token, the court must acknowledge the somewhat attenuated support you have from family and community networks. The letters submitted by your sister, Ms Natasha H, are candid in their acknowledgement of longstanding difficulties, including disputes over accommodation and challenges related to your occasional periods of homelessness. Those letters express concern for your welfare and hope for rehabilitation but stop short of offering assurances of sustained supervision upon release.

This underlines a recurring theme this court has encountered in cases involving repeat acquisitive offending: the tension between personal and social responsibility, and the strain on informal and formal networks. The proliferation of single-person households, fractured familial ties, and the increase in urban homelessness all contribute to an erosion of traditional social safeguards, a phenomenon documented in multiple sociology papers and government reports.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

It is in this broader social context that this court views the offending before it. Many of the institutional partners involved, including the local authority housing teams, community mental health services, and voluntary sector support organisations, are aspirational in their aims yet constrained in capacity. The North East London Homelessness Charity, for example, referenced in recent correspondence, notes a 15% increase in demand over the last two years coincident with a decline in funding, rendering their capacity for proactive interventions severely limited.

The court is mindful, too, of the difficulties experienced by the Legal Aid Agency, which has been repeatedly brought to account by Parliamentary select committees for delays in authorisation of funding for independent expert reports and forensic evidence. The operational impact on defence practitioners is well-documented, considering reductions in hourly rates and the growing administrative burden, increasingly diverting resources from client interaction.

Turning to principles of sentencing, the Theft Offences guideline, as promulgated by the Sentencing Council in the 2021 edition, provides that the seriousness of the offence is to be assessed by reference to both harm and culpability, with harm including economic loss and psychological impact on victims.

Your offending involves repeated instances, planned in nature, and carried out in a manner that caused real distress to retail employees. The volume and value of goods stolen, while not high in individual instances, amount cumulatively to a substantial economic loss as well as damage to business operations.

The aggravating features include previous convictions, disregard for warnings, and failure to engage meaningfully with support mechanisms. There is little evidence of remorse beyond belated acceptance of responsibility.

Sentencing aims must balance punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public. In light of your history and risk profile, the court contemplates whether custodial detention or a community sentence with requirements is appropriate, bearing in mind the principles elucidated in the leading case of R v. B [2019] EWCA Crim 1357, where the Court emphasised the need for tailored rehabilitative interventions commensurate with risk, but also underscored that persistent acquisitive offending may warrant immediate custody to uphold the message of deterrence.

In relation to sentencing discounts, and in accordance with court practice and case law such as R v. Peters [2020] EWCA Crim 1120, an
