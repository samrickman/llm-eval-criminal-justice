IN THE CROWN COURT AT MIDDLESBOROUGH  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. M2025/04829  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. Keir  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing on a single count of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, representing a pattern of persistent shoplifting offences committed over a protracted period from early 2023 to March 2025. The offences took place across several retail premises within the Middlesbrough area, including convenience stores, small independent pharmacies, and a number of discount retailers.

Procedural History  
Your case came before the Middlesbrough Crown Court following a protracted investigative process led by the Unified Retail Crime Taskforce (URCT), operating under the Current Crime Reduction Protocol (CCRP). The initial reporting of individual incidents by store managers in the summer of 2023 was treated as isolated until an internal data-matching exercise triggered linkage of multiple thefts involving items of low but repeated monetary value. This pattern was subsequently corroborated by the local Business Crime Alliance, which maintains an intelligence-sharing database between retailers, law enforcement, and trading standards officers.  

The volume of routine acquisitive crime complaints has increased steadily in recent years, imposing significant operational burdens across the criminal justice system. The taskforce's work here entailed detailed examination of digital evidence, including time-stamped CCTV footage, point-of-sale transaction diaries, and staff witness statements. The collection and collation of these data spanned several months and was complicated by intermittent staffing shortages within the Metropolitan Police’s Retail Crime Unit, exacerbated by industrial dispute-driven absences and regional coordination issues at the time.  

It is additionally recorded that the court was notified of delays occasioned by necessary procedures to secure funding approvals for forensic psychological reports, following applications made under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO). This caused an adjournment from the originally scheduled sentence hearing date in June 2025 to the current listing.  

The operation of the Better Case Management (BCM) framework has, on balance, been satisfactory in this matter. All requisite case progression steps—initial allocation, disclosure, and service of defence statements—were completed within procedural timelines notwithstanding the challenges noted. Such procedural compliance is to be welcomed and indicates the commitment of all parties notwithstanding systemic pressures on court business due to recent backlog increases and resource constraints.  

The Crown was represented by Ms Joan Fairclough, Senior Crown Prosecutor, whose submissions were clear and concise. Mr Andrew Collins appeared on your behalf under legal aid certification and provided diligent advocacy.  

Ms Fairclough informed the court that you initially entered a not guilty plea but entered a plea of guilty to the representative charge shortly before trial following the serving of refreshed evidential material. The court is mindful of the case authority in R v Toms [2019] EWCA Crim 147, where reduced credit was affirmed for late pleas made only when the prosecution case became incontrovertible. That principle is engaged on the facts here, meriting consideration in mitigation but excluding maximum allowable discount.  

Indeed, historically, the court has observed in R v Somerville [2015] EWCA Crim 363 that the timing of admissions remains a significant factor in sentencing, recognizing court efficiency and the avoidance of trauma to witnesses and victims as important public interests.  

As a procedural aside, I note that the arrangements for interpreter services during a preliminary hearing in March 2025 were delayed due to scheduling conflicts with an external agency, reflecting wider pressures on language support services in the region. Such logistical obstacles, while frustrating, must be acknowledged as external to the defendant or prosecuting authority.  

It is also material to record that this court received correspondence from the Middlesbrough Retail Workers’ Support Network (MRWSN), a charitable organisation providing advice and wellbeing support to shop floor staff affected by theft and related antisocial behaviour. Their detailed briefing, while presenting no direct claim concerning this case, emphasised the psychological toll on employees who regularly confront instances of shoplifting, including threats and aggression. The court commends their ongoing work, especially within constrained funding environments and amidst rising demand for frontline support.  

By way of wider social context, this matter arises against the backdrop of a growing prevalence of street homelessness and associated criminality in urban centres across the North East. Local authorities continue to grapple with increasing rates of rough sleeping and the attendant risks of substance misuse, mental health crises, and physical vulnerability. The impact of these intersecting issues on retail crime syndicates, both organised and opportunistic, is not insignificant.  

Adjacent procedural detail: the case experienced a brief adjournment in April 2025 due to postal service disruptions affecting the timely delivery of defence disclosure, itself a minor but illustrative example of the broader infrastructural pressures impacting judicial administration.  

Legal Context  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 articulates the offence with which you are charged. While shoplifting often involves low monetary values, this must not obscure the cumulative impact on victims and communities. The Sentencing Council guideline for theft offences (effective April 2022) provides a framework emphasizing the defendant’s culpability, harm caused, previous convictions, and personal circumstances. Notably, aggravating features such as targeting vulnerable businesses or repeated offending are relevant.  

To situate the present matter in wider jurisprudence, reference is made to the commentary in R v Beard [2020] EWCA Crim 703, which highlighted that even seemingly minor thefts could attract immediate custodial sentences where persistence and disregard for warnings indicate significant culpability.  

Consider also R v Sanders [2018] EWCA Crim 550, where the defendant engaged in organised shoplifting involving accomplices, resulting in terms of 18 months and above despite low individual monetary values—the court reiterating the principle that offence seriousness is not solely measured in pounds but also in social impact. While the present case does not involve co-offenders, the persistent course of conduct is similarly relevant.  

The court notes with concern the increasing strain on probation services in the area. Staff shortages, exacerbated by rising caseloads, have impeded comprehensive risk assessment and monitoring, creating challenges in delivering tailored rehabilitative plans. Such systemic factors, while not determinative, must be borne in mind when considering sentence planning and resource allocation.  

An illustrative example of institutional challenge is the recent suspension of a probation officer assigned to local MAPPA arrangements, pending investigation for unrelated conduct. The resulting temporary reassignment has caused delays in supervisory visits across multiple cases, evidencing the fragility of frontline services.  

The facts of the offending behaviour are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

The court notes the nature of the items targeted—predominantly high-turnover, low-cost goods—as well as the deliberate use of concealment and timing strategies, evidenced by multiple store interviews detailing your behaviour.  

Your activity, although non-violent, caused significant disruption. Staff reports describe increased anxiety, reallocation of duties to avoid lone working, and in some instances early termination of shifts. These indirect consequences continue to bear on employee wellbeing.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Emerging themes in police records include repeated offenses despite previous interventions, including conditional cautions and community resolutions. These facts point towards an entrenched behavioural pattern resistant to informal deterrence.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

In some instances, stolen goods included restricted pharmacy items, amplifying the potential harm to public health through diversion or misuse. This elevate the matter's gravity beyond mere shop theft.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

It is pertinent to acknowledge that notwithstanding offers of assistance from local support services, including harm reduction advice, financial counselling, and temporary housing as facilitated by the Middlesbrough Housing Association (MHA), your engagement has been sporadic and inconsistent at best.  

Several victim impact statements, submitted through the Middlesbrough Retail Crime Partnership, paint a vivid picture of community harm, financial loss, and the emotional distress caused by your offending. These include testimonials from small business owners reliant on tight margins to sustain viability.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

You have a modest but relevant previous record, including three prior crimes of dishonesty dating from 2019 to 2023. Each occasion saw diversionary measures attempted, including a restorative justice referral in 2021. The latter failed to effect meaningful change.

Expert Assessments and Reports  
The court has received a comprehensive psychiatric report submitted by Dr Carol Langston, consultant forensic psychiatrist, commissioned by the defence and authorised under section 35 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Dr Langston’s assessment, conducted on 15 August 2025, records no diagnosis of a major psychiatric disorder such as psychosis or bipolar affective disorder. However, she identifies notable traits of borderline personality disorder, including impulsivity, unstable interpersonal relationships, and emotional dysregulation.  

Dr Langston suggests these traits may partly explain poor decision-making and the maladaptive coping behaviours observed. Of significance, however, is the report’s observation of your inconsistent engagement with voluntary service referrals and a limited appreciation of the consequences of your conduct on others. Substance misuse has been indicated as a contributory factor, though not at a level warranting separate diagnosis of dependence syndrome.  

The conclusion calls for a multi-modal rehabilitative approach incorporating mental health support, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), and structured probation oversight. The author appropriately notes that effective rehabilitation is likely to require sustained engagement, which has historically been problematic in your case.  

The probation pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Evelyn Morton (dated 6 September 2025) resonates with the psychiatric findings, highlighting elevated reoffending risk driven by impulsivity, social exclusion, and economic instability. It also notes the widening gap in suitable accommodation options for individuals in your circumstances, with particular emphasis on the scarcity of supported housing placements capable of integrating therapeutic and resettlement services.  

This scarcity corresponds with reports received from Shelter Haven, a local non-governmental organisation providing emergency accommodation and advice. Shelter Haven’s correspondence draws attention to frictions between housing supply and demand, a challenge compounded in Middlesbrough by rising numbers of young adult rough sleepers and entrenched street-based criminal economies.  

The fragmentation of adult social care and welfare provision, particularly following austerity-era reforms, has exacerbated these systemic gaps. The court is cognizant of the political debate surrounding these policies but as ever must weigh public protection and individual welfare within the legal framework.  

It is apparent that any effective intervention in your case will require multi-agency collaboration, including health services, housing authorities, and offender management teams. This is reflected in a recent joint case conference convened by the Middlesbrough Integrated Offender Management Unit, involving representatives from health, social care, and the voluntary sector.  

The court is grateful for the detailed submissions received from Ms Teresa Quigley of the Middlesbrough Community Wellbeing Trust, whose briefing underscores the positive, albeit limited, impact of peer-support groups in reducing social isolation amongst offenders with complex needs. Such initiatives, while not sufficient on their own, form a valuable component in ensuring sustainable desistance.  

It is worthy of note that the Mental Health Act 1983 remains a relevant statutory instrument in circumstances where serious psychiatric disorder and associated risks arise, though that is not currently the case here. Nevertheless, ongoing monitoring for emergent mental health concerns is prudent, given the fluid nature of behavioral health.  

Similarly, reference is made to the Sentencing Council’s guideline on custodial thresholds and alternatives to custody, particularly where community-based disposals may align with risk levels and rehabilitative needs in lower-harm acquisitive crime. The guideline reiterates the necessity of balancing public protection with the principles of proportionality, personal mitigation, and likelihood of offence reduction.  

The court has additionally reviewed a recent letter from Ms Helena King, the defendant’s older sister, sent on 7 September 2025. Her letter attests to the defendant’s difficult upbringing, marked by early childhood adversity and family instability. While such background is not a causative defence, it is relevant context. Ms King expresses hope that rehabilitation and therapeutic support might be prioritized.  

Considerations relating to Resources  
This case again highlights the critical pressures facing the Legal Aid Agency, whose operational delays in authorizing expert evidence—here, the assessment by Dr Langston—introduce avoidable procedural inertia. The court wishes to join calls from the judiciary for systemic reform to ensure timely access to funding for properly qualified independent experts, which is essential for fair and full adjudication.  

Further, the strain on Housing Services and Probation continues to be a sobering reality. In a recent article published by the Regional Justice Forum (August 2025), it was observed that housing shortages, high demand, and funding shortfalls have collectively undermined attempts to provide stable accommodation to offenders with complex needs. The report advocates for enhanced cross-departmental funding arrangements and greater community-sector integration. Such recommendations, while beyond this court’s remit, are vitally pertinent to cases of this nature.  

Victim Impact  
Representations received from retail management highlight not only the financial losses incurred, but also the psychological effects on staff. The anxiety engendered by recurrent thefts, concerns over personal safety, and the devaluation of their work must not be overlooked. Such impacts ripple through the workforce and can reduce staff retention in already challenged retail sectors.  

While no direct violence or threats were employed by you, the indirect consequences of your offending—including increased security costs and reduced service availability—constitute real harm. The court is aware that these factors weigh heavily in sentencing considerations.  

Summary of Offending Conduct  
Your conduct reveals continuing disregard for the rule of law and an unwillingness to engage constructively with available support. The persistent nature of your offending, your targeting of multiple sites, and your lack of cooperation with preventative interventions undermine public confidence in justice and community safety.

Sentencing Considerations  
This court must approach sentencing mindful of the dual imperatives: protecting the public and promoting your rehabilitation. Persistent shoplifting offences are rarely victimless and can cumulatively exact significant harm on individuals and businesses.  

Your late guilty plea is to be noted but affords a lesser degree of mitigation due to its timing. The delay necessitated prolonged preparation and compromised opportunities to spare witnesses the ordeal of giving evidence.  

The mitigating accounts of your unstable background, impulsive traits, and current social vulnerabilities are not ignored but must be balanced within the wider interests of justice.  

Community-based disposals with appropriate supervision and rehabilitative services remain a potential avenue for sentencing, especially where probation is able to deliver integrated packages addressing behavioural, mental health, and socio-economic factors. The report from probation will be vital in assessing such options. Equally, the court recognises that immediate custody may be necessary if community measures are judged insufficient to reduce the risk of harm or reoffending.  

The appropriate sentence will be determined once the pre-sentence report has been prepared and submitted to the court, having considered all attendant factors including risk, need, and culpability.  

The court records its thanks to all who have contributed to proceedings, including the staff of the Middlesbrough Business Crime Partnership, the probation officers, and the charitable organisations assisting in this matter.  

These are the sentencing remarks of Her Honour Judge L. M. Keir, issued on 14 September 2025 in Court 5 at Middlesbrough Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 within 28 days. No reporting restrictions pursuant to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, section 49, are currently applicable. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
