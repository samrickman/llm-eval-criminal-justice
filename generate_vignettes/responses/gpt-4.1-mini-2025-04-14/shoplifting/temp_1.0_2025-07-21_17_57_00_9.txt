IN THE CROWN COURT AT COVENTRY  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/03456  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. DONOVAN  
Filed: 11 September 2026  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence upon conviction for a representative count of theft committed in a series of incidents between May 2025 and March 2026. The offences, prosecuting a course of shoplifting from multiple retail premises in the Coventry and Warwickshire area, engage section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This prosecution arises amid concerns not only about individual culpability but also the broader implications of persistent acquisitive offending on public confidence and community wellbeing.

Procedural and Investigative Context  
You were detained on 15 March 2026, following extensive investigatory work coordinated primarily by the West Midlands Police Retail Crime Unit, in collaboration with the Coventry Business Crime Alliance and local Safer Streets initiative. It is a regrettable but all too familiar circumstance that offences of this nature require significant investment of time and resources far exceeding the apparent immediate harm. Indeed, the process involved scrutiny of multiple CCTV sources, cross-referencing of store theft reports, and liaison with security personnel from at least seven separate retailers. Such investigative thoroughness, while laudable, illustrates the strain on public authorities in responding effectively to what are often dismissed as "minor" criminal matters.

The court is conscious of the relentless demands placed on policing services, which, over the recent years, have included the increased burden of managing low-level acquisitive offences. This is highlighted in operational reviews undertaken by the West Midlands Police, which indicate a 12% increase in retail theft offences recorded in the past eighteen months, coinciding with marked vacancies among crime analysts and frontline officers. Moreover, the Retail Crime Alliance, despite constrained budgets and a fluid membership, has maintained a concerted effort to combat repeat offending, often drawing on informal intelligence sharing and targeted operations.  

Of note, your arrest followed a carefully authorised use of mobile phone location data, pursuant to a judicial warrant granted under section 29 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. The application process involved meticulous scrutiny by a designated surveillance commissioner and was grounded in concerns about your repeated presence near premises shortly before thefts occurred. The proportionality of such intrusive techniques is weighed carefully against privacy considerations and the need for effective prevention and detection of crime. Here, the court notes the satisfactory compliance of law enforcement agencies with procedural safeguards during that investigative phase.

Historical and Legal Framework  
The Theft Act 1968, at section 1, codifies theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner thereof. Such conduct, when occurring in a sustained and calculated sequence, is rightly met with sentencing commensurate to the impact on victim confidence and community cohesion. 

This court is mindful of the guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council for theft offences (Version 5.1, effective from 1 July 2025), which delineate levels of seriousness—a framework that recognises factors such as persistence, planning, use of concealment, and effect on vulnerable victims or community establishments. The present offending exhibits elements placing it in Category C or higher, reflecting repeated conduct rather than isolated lapses.

The appellate authority continues to reiterate the principles underpinning sentencing in such cases. In R v. Adlington [2023] EWCA Crim 405, the court affirmed that persistent shoplifting, even if comprising low-value takings, can cumulatively warrant a significant custodial sentence where prior warnings and interventions have been disregarded. Equally, R v. Serrano [2021] EWCA Crim 1487, involving thefts from multiple convenience stores across a metropolitan area, underscores the erosion of community safety when offences provoke tangible fear among retail staff and patrons. Such case law informs this court’s approach, aligning punishment with both individual culpability and the legitimate expectations of society.

The Better Case Management (BCM) protocol guided the progression of your matter. The initial charge was filed on 5 April 2026, with a plea and trial preparation hearing convened promptly on 18 May. Despite the procedural streamlining BCM seeks to promote, this case experienced adjournments partly due to applications from the defence to secure funding for expert psychiatric reports, delays in the appointment of probation officers, and the necessity of securing witness availability amid changing police shift patterns resulting from industrial action. The court recognises and regrets the impact of such delays on all parties.

Mitigation and Support Services  
Throughout these proceedings, attempts were made by various agencies to engage with you and secure your participation in rehabilitative programmes. Coventry Probation Trust compiled a detailed report dated 7 September 2026, which includes reference to your interactions with the Probation Liaison Officer, Ms Jane Feltham. The report acknowledges your expressed difficulties, including unstable housing, intermittent employment, and a history of self-reported anxiety symptoms.

Dr Ian Merrick, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided an assessment on instruction by the defence, which was received by the court on 2 September 2026. Dr Merrick’s evaluation, while concluding that no major mental illness was evident, identifies traits consistent with impulsivity and a pattern of avoidance of structured support. His report underscores your failure to engage meaningfully with community resources, despite their availability and previous outreach efforts. It also noted mild depressive symptoms, but none sufficient to profoundly impact capacity or responsibility.

The court notes letters from the Coventry Hope Project and the Midlands Shelter Network, dated July and August 2026 respectively, which describe ongoing challenges faced by individuals in temporary accommodation arrangements. Though broadly of general applicability rather than case-specific, these documents illustrate the wider social environment in which your case unfolds. There are multiple reports nationwide of increasing homelessness, with a particular strain impacting support services during winter months. Such factors, systemic though they are, invite a cautious reflection on the structural conditions facing many defendants, but are not direct causes or excuses for criminal conduct.

Rehabilitation programmes such as the National Thinking Skills Service have limited availability given resource constraints nationwide. Coventry's Community Justice Hub has recently been engaged in pilot schemes targeting acquisitive offending with a blend of cognitive behavioural therapy, social skills training, and vocational support. Unfortunately, your participation in previous offers was sporadic. This court reiterates that rehabilitation requires genuine commitment from the individual, without which the efficacy of even well-designed interventions is markedly diminished.

Victim Impact and Wider Consequences  
Victim personal statements received from several stores painted a vivid picture of the impact of your offending. Managers described heightened staff anxiety, with some employees reporting stress-related absences. Loss prevention officers testified to the demoralising effect of repeated offences, as well as concerns about personal safety despite no direct threat or violence having been used.

It is a misunderstanding to regard shoplifting, especially repeated, as victimless. The economic losses are absorbed, ultimately, through reduced staff hours, increased security expenditure, and often increased pricing that affects all consumers. More significantly, these offences er
