IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHBROUGH  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14567  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. A. PRITCHARD  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentencing in respect of a charge of theft, namely a course of shoplifting offences perpetrated in the metropolitan area of Southbrough and its environs over the period spanning late 2023 through to May of this year. These proceedings have been conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Theft Act 1968, particularly section 1 thereof, which defines the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it as theft.

Procedural and Investigative Background  
Your arrest occurred on 8 June 2025 following a sustained and coordinated investigation spearheaded by Southbrough Metropolitan Police Service, with contributions from the Retail Crime Unit and the local Business Crime Partnership. This investigation entailed the collation of intelligence from various retail outlets, analysis of closed-circuit television footage, and cross-referencing reports made across multiple locations experiencing a high frequency of shop theft incidents, most notably independent convenience stores and community pharmacies. This regional approach reflects the increasing sophistication with which acquisitive offenders operate, exploiting gaps in localised awareness and enforcement. The investigative phase was extended and resource-intensive, spanning nearly two months, with teams dedicated to reviewing hundreds of hours of recorded visual material and liaising with store managers and staff to construct an evidential matrix.

This intensive allocation of police and civilian resources to what might superficially appear a series of low-value thefts is a reflection of the prevailing challenges faced by law enforcement and commercial enterprises alike. Increasingly, ‘minor’ offences like shoplifting necessitate disproportionate investigatory effort, a reality born of the cumulative impact on affected businesses and the wider community. The Crown Prosecution Service advanced the charge subsequent to a thorough evidential review, culminating in the current proceedings before the Crown Court.  

Despite the comparatively modest individual values of goods stolen, the emergent pattern of repeated offending and the calculated nature of the conduct informed the decision to prosecute summarily. I acknowledge, with some concern, the repeated observations by local enforcement bodies regarding the strain placed upon policing and retail security teams in attempting to deter and detect acquisitive crime in an era of stretched budgets and rising demands for visible presence on the streets.

References to the historical context of the Theft Act 1968 serve as a reminder that while the statute remains the principal legislative instrument for the prosecution of theft offences, its application must be situated within a social framework increasingly burdened by economic hardship and social dislocation. Nonetheless, it remains the immutable duty of the court to uphold the principles of justice and deterrence irrespective of such pressures.

During the initial hearing on 15 July 2025, you pleaded not guilty, electing to contest the allegations. However, following service and scrutiny of further CCTV evidence, witness statements, and forensic results, your counsel made application on 29 August 2025 to tender a guilty plea to a single representative count, which was accepted by the Crown on 2 September 2025. This plea, though belated, is recorded and will inform the extent of any credit to be awarded at sentence.

It is critical at this juncture to acknowledge the procedural frameworks guiding such matters, including the Better Case Management protocols established in 2013, which aim to facilitate early identification of contentious issues and promote efficiency in case progression. The case has unfolded in general conformity with these protocols, notwithstanding some adjournments requested by the defence for expert report preparation and consultation with probation services.

The court also notes, with measured gratitude, the assistance provided by the Southbrough Retail Workers’ Union and the Consumer Support Network, both of whom submitted written representations attesting to the adverse impact of repeated shop theft on employee welfare and business viability. Their contributions underscore the tangible harm resultant from such offending, beyond immediate economic loss.

It is an unfortunate but observable reality in contemporary criminal justice that lower-level acquisitive crimes consume a disproportional share of judicial and enforcement attention, as evidenced in recent reports from the National Retail Crime Survey (2024), which highlight a national increase in retail theftly offences by 15% over the preceding two years. Moreover, the consequent attrition in specialist investigative capacity exacerbates risks of delay and procedural complexity.

Drawing parallels with precedent authority—in R v. Thornton [2019] EWCA Crim 2436, for example—the Court of Appeal affirmed that repeat shoplifting offences, even of comparatively low monetary value, may warrant pronounced sentencing responses where they demonstrate persistence, planning, and disregard for prior warnings or community resolutions. The present matter echoes those concerns. Furthermore, R v. Sanderson [2023] EWCA Crim 1751 reiterated that the cumulative impact on small businesses, especially those operating on narrow margins, merits significant consideration.

The court is mindful of the broader statutory landscape, including the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline (2021), which emphasises harm both in direct financial terms and indirect factors such as victim vulnerability, deliberate targeting of specific groups, and psychological impact upon retail staff. Aggravating and mitigating features therein bear directly upon the assessment of culpability and sentencing range.

It bears noting also the related jurisprudence surrounding late guilty pleas. In R v. Chauhan [2021] EWCA Crim 1467, the Court of Appeal held that credit for admission of guilt must be proportionate to the timing and sincerity of the plea. The late-entered pleas that coincide with the near-certainty of conviction attract diminished discount, reflecting the diminished procedural economy and limited alleviation of witness burden. This principle will be applied in the instant case.

Mental Health and Social Circumstances  
An independent psychiatric report was commissioned at the defence’s behest, prepared by Dr Rosalind K. Hayworth, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who conducted a clinical evaluation on 5 August 2025. Dr Hayworth’s report is comprehensive and professionally articulated, identifying no major psychiatric disorder, though noting traits of underlying anxiety and stress linked to unstable housing and financial insecurity. The report indicates no evidence of psychosis or cognitive impairment but highlights a history of sporadic alcohol misuse, with no formal treatment intervened to date. Dr Hayworth emphasises that these factors, while not mitigating criminal responsibility, inform contextual understanding of the defendant’s circumstances.

I place on record my appreciation for the report’s diligence and the careful manner in which clinical observations were integrated with background psychosocial material. The report candidly notes that engagement with support services has been inconsistent and that the acceptance of help has been limited. Such reluctance, while not uncommon in cases of persistent acquisitive offending, is regrettable given the availability of multiple community resources.

It may be relevant to add here that the Probation Service is currently experiencing staffing shortages, which has impacted supervision levels and access to specialist programmes tailored to impulsivity and acquisitive offending. The courts remain hopeful that ongoing recruitment efforts can mitigate these systemic challenges.

In examining foundational social factors, it is similarly pertinent to mention correspondence received from the Southbrough Homelessness Support Coalition, which attests to rising levels of street homelessness in the region, increased
