IN THE CROWN COURT AT ILFORD  
R v. MR H  
Case No. ILF/2025/04517  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. E. MORLAND  
Filed: 18 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for offences of shoplifting committed over a protracted period within the East London boroughs, chiefly Ilford, Leytonstone, and Barking. The indictment charges you with theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, reflecting a course of conduct involving multiple retail premises. While shoplifting is often dismissed by the public as a minor or victimless crime, the court is acutely aware of the profound ramifications such offending can have on individuals, businesses, and the community fabric.  

Procedural Overview  
You were initially charged following your arrest on 15 April 2025, a date which followed a sustained period of investigation by the Metropolitan Police Service’s Safer Neighbourhood Teams alongside officers from the Retail Crime Unit. This investigation employed several sophisticated policing strategies, including a joint operation with the Ilford Business Crime Reduction Partnership. The partnership’s objective is to enhance communication between retailers, enable rapid intelligence sharing, and enable targeted interventions to disrupt repeat offending. Notwithstanding the well-publicised existence of the partnership, the court notes with some frustration the evident challenges outlined in correspondence from Retail Crime Unit officers, including staffing shortages, inconsistent participation from smaller retailers, and the administrative burdens of maintaining comprehensive offender profiles.  

It is regrettably the case, as the court has observed in numerous other hearings, that the resources allocated to policing acquisitive crime at the local level have shown a marked imbalance relative to the volume of offences. Officers routinely invest many hours in evidence gathering, preparing witness statements, securing CCTV footage, and liaising with overwhelmed victim support services — often in exchange for the recovery of goods valued only in tens of pounds. The relentless pressure this places on police investigators contributes to the well-noted problem of delayed case progression and compromised witness availability.  

Your initial appearance occurred on 22 April 2025 at Ilford Magistrates’ Court. Bail was granted on strict conditions, including a curfew and electronic monitoring, given concerns about your prior record and the risk of further offending pending trial. The case was committed to this court due to the volume and pattern of offending, following a plea and trial preparation hearing on 10 June 2025.  

During the BCM (Better Case Management) process, the court acknowledges the efforts of all involved parties, in particular the liaison officers whose role in collating victim impact statements and monitoring your engagement with support services was invaluable. Despite some inevitable delays — caused partly by listing constraints and partly by administrative backlogs within Legal Aid processing — the case has proceeded without undue procedural irregularity.  

Your initial plea, entered on 10 June, was not guilty. However, following the receipt of additional documentation including forensic and CCTV evidence, you changed your plea to guilty at arraignment on 13 August 2025. As established in case law, notably R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, late pleas necessarily attract reduced mitigation where they result from tactical decisions rather than genuine remorse or acceptance of responsibility. The court is mindful of the guidance to assess such credit carefully, as reiterated in R v. Linley [2018] EWCA Crim 1944, where timeliness of guilty plea was critical in determining the extent of sentencing discount.  

I record the presence of Ms Amelia Thornton for the Crown and Mr James Redford, appearing under Legal Aid representation, whose professional diligence in this matter is noted and appreciated despite ongoing frustrations with system delays. The court takes this opportunity to register displeasure at the recurring difficulty in obtaining prompt Legal Aid authorisations, particularly for expert psychiatric and psychological evaluations, which serve vital functions both in defence and sentencing mitigation. The systemic nature of these bottlenecks has become a regrettable feature of our justice system.  

Historical and Case Law Context  
Before addressing the particulars relevant to your offending, it bears noting the statutory framework and underlying principles applicable to theft offences. The Theft Act 1968, section 1, remains the foundational provision, characterising theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive. 

The Sentencing Council's Theft Offences Definitive Guideline emphasises the need to consider not only the value of items stolen but also the nature of offending, vulnerability of victims or premises targeted, and any aggravating or mitigating factors. Repeat offending, use of deception or distraction, and persistence amidst warnings all weigh heavily in the culpability assessment.  

Relevant authority includes R v. Havers [2022] EWCA Crim 1602, which confirmed that repeated thefts from vulnerable or community-benefitting premises, such as charitable shops or pharmacies, merit custodial sentences commensurate with the cumulative harm caused. Similarly, the Court of Appeal in R v. Haslow [2021] EWCA Crim 1754 underlined that calculated offending, sustained over time and reflective of disregard for community impact, requires deterrent sentences even where single instances might be considered low-level.

The court is also mindful of the broader societal context. It is not my role to moralise unduly, yet the incremental erosion of respect for retail premises and those who work there cannot be ignored. Sustained petty theft contributes to a cycle of loss, increased security measures, reduced staff confidence, and ultimately closure or reduced service hours for vulnerable communities.

The facts of the case are as follows:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

This representation has been corroborated through multiple sources, including CCTV footage and witness statements obtained as part of the initial investigatory phase. The incidents involved a range of items from everyday consumer goods to specially marked pharmacy products, targeted covertly and with repeated presence at particular stores.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

Several of the retail outlets involved engaged in additional security measures during the months in question. These included rearranged shelving, added store staff during peak hours, and liaison with the police Retail Crime Unit in an effort to deter your presence. Such effects are not trivial. Moreover, the psychological impact on shop employees, many of whom are young and working long hours for modest wages, has been palpable. Several have provided victim impact statements referencing anxiety, reduced job satisfaction, and feelings of vulnerability upon spotting you.

The dynamics of your case are complicated by the interplay of personal circumstances, prior convictions, and apparent non-engagement with available support services. Reports from probation and social services provide a mixed perspective.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

The court received a comprehensive psychiatric report from Dr Fiona Robson, consultant forensic psychiatrist, submitted pursuant to the request made at the plea and trial preparation hearing. Dr Robson’s assessment, dating from 5 September 2025, notes that while you do not meet criteria for major mental illness, you exhibit significant traits of impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and intermittent substance misuse, particularly surrounding episodic increases in consumption of alcohol and cannabis. The report further remarks upon your reported difficulties in sustaining stable employment and accommodation, contributing to a chaotic lifestyle insufficiently buffered by formal or informal social supports.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

It ought to be recorded that while Dr Robson's report is detailed and professionally composed, its clinical analysis in the context of sentencing mitigation must be viewed alongside your repeated refusal and failure to engage with recommended community support services and treatment programmes offered under local initiatives at various times over the past two years. The court is mindful that voluntary engagement can be challenging, particularly in circumstances of deprivation or social dislocation, but absence of effort to seek or accept help cannot be lightly excused.  

Similarly, a pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Ms Laura Fielding summarises the difficulties faced in supervising acquisitive offending cases in under-resourced borough teams. High caseloads, limited capacity for intensive support, and pressure on multi-agency coordination often limit intervention effectiveness. Ms Fielding comments that your previous contacts with the probation service have been characterised by sporadic attendance and inconsistent communication, raising notable concerns about your readiness to commit to rehabilitative requirements such as cognitive behavioural programmes or substance use treatment.  

Additional correspondence was submitted by the local authority housing department, flagging your current status in supported temporary accommodation, with some familiar notes of tenancy breaches involving noise and neighbour complaints. These residential pressures recur in the background of many such cases, generating further strain on overstretched public resources.  

The impact on victims and retail businesses warrants particular emphasis. The Ilford Borough Business Crime Reduction Partnership relayed their continuing efforts to support local stores coping with shrinkage — a euphemism for stock loss — which in recent years has increased markedly in the area. Such increases have been attributed not only to economic factors but also the normalisation of petty theft in some communities and the broader social dislocation witnessed in post-pandemic environments.

It is important to situate the offending in a wider institutional context. The case unfolded in a period marked by persistently high retail crime figures, with spikes during large public events, holidays, and pay cycles. While not unique, your conduct must be judged on its own merits — the court cannot ignore that valuable public funds were expended in investigation and case management.  

Moreover, the ancillary burden placed on store proprietors and employees includes not merely loss of goods, but elevated insurance premiums, increased security installations, and temporary loss of trade during incident investigation. Many of these factors contribute to an environment where small independent retailers face existential threats.

In considering the totality of the evidence, submissions from counsel deserve acknowledgment. Ms Thornton for the Crown rightly emphasised the pattern of offending despite prior community
