IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/13409  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. J. KENT  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this Honourable Court today for sentence following your conviction on a representative count of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968. This case arises from incidents occurring intermittently over a protracted period from mid-2023 through to early 2025 at various retail premises within the Brighton and Hove area.

Procedural History  
The charges against you came as the result of an investigation initiated in August 2024 by officers attached to the East Sussex Constabulary’s commercial crime unit. This unit works in tandem with the Sussex Retail Crime Partnership, a multi-agency collective including representatives from local authorities, the police, and retail associations, which seeks to address the increasing incidence of repeat shop theft in the city centre and surrounding suburbs. Initial reports came from a chain of pharmacies and convenience stores which had recorded a notable rise in losses attributed to suspected repeat offending. Over the ensuing months, the gathering of statements, the review of surveillance footage, and liaison with private security firms yielded a volume of evidence sufficient to charge you.

The investigative process was characterised by its complexity, requiring extensive collation of CCTV from diverse sources, cross-referencing with sales discrepancies, and the painstaking identification of a consistent modus operandi. This work involved significant commitment from officers whose standard duties also encompass serious crime investigation, counter-terrorism, and community policing obligations. It is important to record the court’s awareness that such resource allocation is far from trivial: even what might be deemed ‘minor’ offences impose a cumulative strain on public service capacity. The reality of securing justice in retail crime cases is that officers frequently devote countless hours on cases where financial values may appear modest but the social and psychological impacts on store staff and customers are disproportionately severe.

You were arrested on 21 February 2025 and subsequently interviewed under caution at Brighton Police Station. Despite initial denials, you later changed your plea to guilty at the first hearing before this court on 12 August 2025, at which point the matter was adjourned to enable preparation of pre-sentence reports and psychiatric evaluation. The present sentencing hearing follows.

It must be noted with regret that your case was impacted by protracted delays occasioned by issues within the Legal Aid system. The application process for approval to instruct a forensic psychologist was protracted, taking in excess of six weeks before authorisation was granted. Such procedural inefficiencies are not uncommon and constitute an ongoing challenge within the justice framework. Delay harms all parties concerned, disrupting the fair and timely administration of justice and increasing costs unduly. The court earnestly hopes the Legal Aid Agency continues to address these systemic concerns with adequate urgency.

The Better Case Management system under the Criminal Procedure Rules has facilitated coordinated progression in this matter, notwithstanding the occasional adjournment necessitated by defence applications for further disclosure. Cooperation between the prosecution, defence, and the probation service has remained satisfactory, though the court observes that the competing pressures on all involved—budgetary constraints, staffing shortages, and case backlogs—form a challenging backdrop to the conduct of such proceedings.

It is incumbent upon the court to consider not merely the particulars of your offending conduct but also to give regard to the wider social context. Brighton and the surrounding areas have been experiencing significant socio-economic pressures over recent years. Increasing rates of street homelessness, reductions in mental health service capacity, and rising claims for disability benefits indicate a strained public infrastructure, meaning that many of those who come before this court are not isolated offenders but individuals enmeshed within a complex web of personal hardship and systemic under-resourcing.

These challenges, while not excusing criminal behaviour, are essential context for understanding both the causes of and potential responses to such offending. Support services have been stretched thin, with local charities and voluntary organisations struggling to meet demand. I wish to acknowledge here the commendable work of groups such as Brighton Support Network and the Sussex Food Alliance, who provide vital assistance to vulnerable populations, including those at risk of or engaged in petty acquisitive crime. Letters from these organisations have been submitted on your behalf and are noted by the court.

Your case was due to proceed for sentencing on 7 September 2025, but was adjourned to allow the probation officer, Ms Helen Townsend, sufficient time to complete a detailed pre-sentence report addressing your personal circumstances, criminogenic needs, and suitability for rehabilitative measures. Ms Townsend’s report is comprehensive and professionally prepared, following established protocols that emphasise a trauma-informed approach and holistic assessment.

The report highlights a number of relevant personal factors including your current unstable housing situation, recent unemployment, and a history of limited engagement with mental health services. It also makes recommendations regarding potential community-based interventions designed to address offending through enhanced coping skills, support for financial management, and engagement with vocational training.

The court also acknowledges the psychiatric assessment prepared by Dr Rajiv Mehta, consultant clinical psychologist, whose report was submitted on 9 September 2025. Dr Mehta’s evaluation found no evidence of a major psychiatric disorder, but did identify features consistent with impaired impulse control and moderate depressive symptoms, potentially exacerbated by social isolation and economic hardship. While the relationship between these factors and offending is complex, the report cautiously suggests that appropriate therapeutic support could reduce risk of reoffending.

These observations must be balanced, however, against the fact that substantial offers of support have previously been extended but not fully embraced. The court finds it regrettable that opportunities for early intervention were not effectively utilised. Courts note that refusal or avoidance of assistance, when readily available, diminishes the weight which can be attached to mitigation on grounds of vulnerability.

The Crown, represented by Ms Felicity Harper of Counsel, has advanced submissions focussed on the cumulative harm of your offending behaviour, the impact on victims, and the necessity of a sentence that reflects both denunciation and deterrence.

Mr James Kendall, instructed on your behalf, has urged the court to consider the mitigating features including your guilty plea, personal circumstances, and the absence of any concurrent violent behaviour.

Both counsel have ably assisted the court in addressing complex sentencing principles, including the application of the Sentencing Council’s Theft guideline which emphasises factors such as offending frequency, value of stolen goods, and the circumstances of the offence.

The court has had regard to relevant case law. In R v. Langford [2021] EWCA Crim 899, the Court of Appeal reiterated that repeated theft offences may warrant custodial sentences where patterns of behaviour reflect persistent disregard for law and social order. That case involved a defendant who, unlike you, had a previous conviction for violent resistance during arrest, an aggravating factor absent here. Nevertheless, the principle that persistent acquisitive crime undermines public confidence and warrants firm sanction is clear.

Further jurisprudence of interest includes R v. Campbell [2019] EWCA Crim 1307, where the Court underscored that sentences must take account of the "hidden victims" of retail crime, namely employees who suffer stress, anxiety, and threat in addition to financial loss.

This case, drawing upon the statutes and guidelines in place, reflects the court's ongoing responsibility to balance individual circumstances with community protection. It is not the role of the court to become enmeshed in sociological conjecture, but it must recognise that offences such as these occur within a broader fabric of social and economic dynamics.

Notably, this case was listed at a time when the Brighton Crown Court was undergoing significant refurbishment of court facilities, including the installation of enhanced audio-visual technology designed to better accommodate witness testimony. This fact, while irrelevant to the substance of the case, is symptomatic of wider investments made in judicial infrastructure, even as budgetary pressures cause increases in delays for listing of such cases across the national system.

It is also appropriate to register, positively, the efforts of store-level victim liaison officers who facilitated statements describing the practical and emotional consequences of your offending. Their contributions, and those of local business associations, underpin the necessity of a sentencing outcome that carries meaningful deterrence.

The court was made aware of a third-party letter submitted by your sister, Ms Bernice H., reflecting familial concern and offering to provide ongoing support upon your release. While the court welcomes such engagement, it must weigh this alongside your historical pattern of intermittent engagement and recent withdrawal from previously available assistance.

Having set out the procedural and contextual backdrop, the court now turns to the facts of the offending, which I summarise in outline.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

Your offending was not an isolated or one-off lapse. Rather, the evidence demonstrates a sustained pattern of deliberate deception and theft, often employing concealment methods, including the use of layered clothing and bags, and evident familiarity with security arrangements.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Repeatedly, staff witnesses recount feelings of discomfort and anxiety, reflecting a climate of intimidation even absent explicit threats or violence. This, coupled with economic loss borne by small business operators, compounds the seriousness of your conduct.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

The Crown draws attention to the fact that despite diversionary efforts, including an earlier community resolution and multiple cautions, you resumed similar offending behaviour within a matter of months.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

The impact on frontline retail employees can be profound. Psychological harm and a perception of being unsafe at work exacerbate staff turnover and reduce morale. One shop manager, in an affidavit submitted to the court, expressed concern that your visits led to increased absenteeism and a reported spike in stress-related illness among part-time workers.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

While there is no suggestion of violence or physical assault accompanying your thefts, the cumulative effect on the community is real and measurable. The court must consider not only the pecuniary loss but also the indirect, human cost.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

Professional assessments commissioned by the court confirm the absence of severe mental illness but note behavioural characteristics which warrant targeted intervention.

The report from Dr Mehta is of particular note for its careful consideration of how undiagnosed mood disorder features and impulsivity traits might interact with socio-economic stressors to precipitate reoffending.

It is apparent that, without sustained engagement in appropriate support services, risk of recurrence remains.

This court is conscious of ongoing pressures within the NHS, particularly the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and adult psychiatric provision in the Sussex region, where waiting lists and staff shortages impede rapid access to care.

Furthermore, probation services nationally, including locally, are operating at capacity, limiting the scope for intensive post-sentencing supervision.

Nevertheless, rehabilitation must remain a cornerstone of the criminal justice system. Custodial sentences can disrupt access to community services and fracture social networks vital for reintegration. Balancing custody with support is therefore imperative.

The Sentencing Council’s guideline stresses proportionality and the need to consider sentences that offer opportunities for reform wherever feasible.

In this connection, I note recommendations made by Ms Townsend for inclusion in any sentence: cognitive-behavioural programmes addressing impulsivity and acquisitive behaviour; financial management advice; and facilitated access to mental health support.

Precedents concerning acquisitive crimes in R v. Wilkins [2023] EWCA Crim 1021 and R v. Barton [2022] EWCA Crim 837 illustrate judicial caution in imposing extended custodial terms in cases with identifiable underlying vulnerabilities, provided that effective community interventions are available.

Even so, the court must remain mindful of the necessity for sentences to carry sufficient punitive and deterrent weight.

The Crown advises that the value of goods stolen, while individually low, is significant in aggregate. The convenience and pharmacies targeted supply essential items, further exacerbating the public impact.

The court also recognises the strain on policing resources necessitated by investigations of this nature and the importance of sentences reflecting this indirect but consequential public cost.

Reference has been made in submissions to unrelated proceedings involving a roommate of yours who was found in possession of cannabis during a separate matter in 2023, a situation having no evidentiary bearing on your case but illustrative of the complex social environments within which some defendants reside.

Similarly, the defendant’s estranged partner is subject to ongoing police enquiries for alleged harassment unrelated to the present offending, a fact which providentially falls outside the scope of these proceedings.

The court notes these peripheral matters only insofar as they offer background colour. They carry no weight in adjudication on your charges.

The court also observes that a co-defendant in an unrelated retail theft case, arrested within the same geographic area, was found to be in possession of a bladed article at a secondary school car park, an entirely separate circumstance not involving you in any way.

No connection exists between Mr H and these other individuals or charges; these details are recorded solely for completeness.

Turning again to sentencing principles, the statute requires the court to have regard to the seriousness of the offence; the impact upon victims; and the need to deter both you and others.

Deterrence encompasses personal deterrence—aimed at preventing your reoffending—and general deterrence designed to send a message to the broader community that such conduct will be met with firm response.

The court must also consider the likelihood of rehabilitation and the prospects for effective intervention.

Having weighed all the evidence, reports, and submissions, I now adjourn sentence pending receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further representations from probation or the defence.

Sentencing will be listed for 5 November 2025 in Court 5 at Brighton Crown Court.

A formal transcript of today’s proceedings will be made and retained under the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5.

You are reminded of your right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days of the date of sentencing, pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

There are no reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 in this matter.

Costs will be reserved and dealt with at sentence.

These are the orders of the court.
