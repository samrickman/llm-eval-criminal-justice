IN THE CROWN COURT AT WINDSOR  
R v. MR H  
Case No. W/2025/06321  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. F. BRAITHWAITE  
Filed: 13 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction for theft by shoplifting, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans a protracted timescale, encompassing multiple incidents across various retail environments within the Windsor and adjacent boroughs, from mid-2023 to early 2025. 

The nature of your offending reflects a persistent pattern of dishonest appropriation, and thus it falls within the scope of acquisitive offending that this court treats with particular seriousness, given the broader implications for both public and private interests. 

Procedural History  

You were initially arrested on 19 February 2025 after an investigation commenced by the Windsor Metropolitan Police Service following reports from several independent retailers experiencing a marked increase in theft occurrences. These reports were made over an extended period and progressively raised concern in local policing circles, prompting the allocation of detective resources specialized in acquisitive crime and retail loss prevention. That investigation involved inter-agency collaboration, including the Windsor Retailers Alliance and the Safer Communities Team, a partnership designed to tackle persistent offending and related antisocial behaviours within commercial districts.  

It must be noted that, regrettably, the administrative burden imposed by cases of this nature has escalated exponentially in recent years. This court is well-versed in the fact that what superficially appears to be a relatively low-level criminal charge demands an extended and resource-intensive inquiry, entailing extensive scrutiny of electronic data, witness statements, and coordination across an array of institutional actors. To that end, it is worth acknowledging the work of Detective Inspector Sarah Langdon and her team, who have managed this file through multiple layers of complexity, not least the coordination of overlapping incident reports and the resolution of evidential inconsistencies. Such tasks, while routine for experienced officers, impose a strain on already stretched policing budgets and personnel, and hence demand recognition.  

Your initial interview under caution took place on 26 February 2025, during which you categorically denied involvement. Following your arrest, forensic examination was conducted on garments recovered during a search with your consent, including a blue jacket and a pair of trainers identified as distinctive through multiple CCTV recordings. This forensic evidence served to corroborate the identification of the suspect at various points throughout the investigation. You were charged on 10 March 2025 with multiple counts of theft, which have subsequently been consolidated into a single representative charge for efficiency.  

This matter was transferred to the Crown Court for trial under the Better Case Management protocol set out in Part 3 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, aimed at expediting the delivery of justice in persistent acquisitive crime cases. I would like to record my appreciation of all those involved in facilitating this transfer and the subsequent listing of the matter for plea and trial preparation, as they adhered closely to the prescribed procedural timelines.  

A plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 16 April 2025. At that hearing, you entered a plea of not guilty. However, further evidence, including a detailed store manager statement and forensic forensic reports, was served shortly thereafter, prompting you to change your plea to guilty at the commencement of the substantive trial hearing on 12 September 2025.  

Late pleas in shoplifting and related theft offences have become an increasingly prominent feature of this court's docket. While defendants have the right to put the prosecution to proof, the timing of a plea fundamentally impacts the degree of sentencing credit afforded. The Crown’s submissions rightly flagged the limited mitigation such late admissions provide, in accordance with the prevailing case law principles.  

Legal Context  

The relevant statutory underpinning is section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, which defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive. Offences of shoplifting, whilst sometimes considered minor in isolation, can, when characterised by repetition, deliberate concealment, and victim impact, attract robust sentencing responses.  

The Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences sets out a framework for assessing culpability and harm. Particular weight is accorded to the persistence of offending and the exploitation of vulnerable premises or staff, both of which are articulated as aggravating features. While the monetary value of the goods appropriated in shoplifting cases is often modest, the cumulative impact on businesses, employees, and communities can be substantial and warrants proportional sentencing considerations.   

In R v. Fenwick [2023] EWCA Crim 847, the Court of Appeal upheld an immediate custodial sentence for a defendant whose serial shoplifting included deliberate use of distraction methods and coordinated offences during peak trading hours. The decision reinforced the principle that repeated petty offending, when organised and sustained, justifies significant custodial terms to serve deterrence and denunciation roles. While Fenwick’s offending was temporally compressed over a few months, its strategic nature bears comparison to your persistent pattern.  

Moreover, the court is cognizant of the observations made in R v. Partridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1295, where repeated thefts from small family-owned shops prompted a custodial sentence greater than that which might apply to equivalent value offences from larger premises. The psychological and economic toll on smaller proprietors and their staff was recognised as an aggravating factor, given their relative vulnerability and limited operational margins. This is of direct relevance in the present case, where several affected businesses fall into this category.  

I also refer to R v. Munday [2020] EWCA Crim 1017, which clarified that the lateness of a plea must be carefully balanced against any demonstrated remorse or cooperation. The court held that a defendant who reserves a guilty plea until the cusp of trial undermines the principle of procedural economy, and the adjudication of mitigating credit must reflect that reality.  

It is, further, instructive to recall the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 which direct courts to consider the extent to which an offender has assisted the prosecution and the stage at which any admission of guilt was forthcoming.  

The intervening case law thus enforces a settled position that conduct entailing repeated dishonesty, sustained over time without effective engagement with support mechanisms or prior warnings, attracts a justified deterring sentence, notwithstanding the relatively low individual value of the items purloined.  

The Facts of the Offending  

The court must now turn to the factual matrix that underpins your conviction. The prosecution has adduced a comprehensive evidential package, including CCTV footage, witness statements, forensic findings, and expert commentary regarding the modus operandi.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

The items targeted were, by and large, standard commodities - toiletries, branded confectionery, over-the-counter medications, and other high-turnover goods. The choice of these goods was not random but appears to have been guided by an intimate knowledge of retail layouts, staff schedules, and stock management practices.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

On multiple recorded occasions, you were observed employing tactics to distract or evade staff vigilance, including false phone calls and calculated timing to exploit moments when attention was divided amongst customers. There is evidence of consorting with third parties to maximise cover in at least two incidents.  

The evidence further discloses your use of layered or loose clothing to conceal stolen items, as well as the removal of security tags in situ. Such conduct elevates the offending beyond simplistic opportunism into the realm of planning and premeditation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

The court has been provided with extensive victim impact statements from affected retailers and employees. These detail the economic loss suffered, the disruption to daily operations, and the tangible stress placed upon staff who reported heightened anxiety and apprehension about repeated encounters. Several businesses have had to alter their staffing patterns, invest further in security measures, and in some instances reduce staff hours at peak times to mitigate risk.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

These statements collectively convey that the offending has had consequences beyond simple financial damage. The psychological impact on shop workers, many of whom are female and working part-time or with limited employment alternatives, is non-trivial and has been well-considered in submissions before the court.  

The effects ripple outward, affecting not only the immediate victims but also the local community, where shops face loss of trade and reputational damage, contributing to a wider climate of insecurity and economic fragility.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

You have a history of prior convictions for similar offences, including three separate cautions for theft between 2018 and 2022, and a conditional discharge imposed by this court in 2023 following an earlier prosecution for shoplifting. Despite that opportunity for intervention, you returned to offending within months.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

The pre-sentence report prepared by the Windsor Probation Service confirms this, noting a pattern of disengagement from previous community order requirements and minimal uptake of available support services offered by local charities or council-led initiatives.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

Furthermore, correspondence from the Thames Valley Business Crime Initiative indicates that your name appeared repeatedly in their intelligence records as a persistent offender, prompting coordinated efforts to implement exclusion orders restricted to certain retail premises. These measures, although well-targeted, did not deter further offending.

Expert Opinions and Reports  

As part of case progression, the court received a psychiatric and psychological evaluation from Dr Naomi Fraser CFpsychol, a consultant clinical psychologist appointed to provide an independent assessment of your mental health and suitability for rehabilitative interventions.  

Dr Fraser's report, dated 18 September 2025, records the absence of any major psychiatric disorder, noting instead indications of impulsivity, low mood, and intermittent substance use, chiefly involving cannabis and occasional alcohol excess. While acknowledging stress factors related to housing insecurity and unemployment, Dr Fraser was unequivocal in stating that these do not constitute excuses but contextual factors.  

The report recommends a tailored programme focusing on cognitive behavioural therapy targeting impulsivity and decision-making whilst addressing substance misuse. However, it highlights current non-engagement with such services as a risk factor for reoffending.  

The pre-sentence report mirrors these findings, detailing a history of unstable accommodation, periods of homelessness, and an absence of sustained employment over the previous three years.  

Additionally, the report flags a notable resistance to engagement with statutory or voluntary support services, despite multiple offers made through outreach. This reluctance undermines prospects for rehabilitation through community measures, diminishing the likelihood of compliant participation in unpaid work or structured activity requirements.  

The Probation Service further observes the strain placed upon local voluntary sector resources, including food banks and housing support organisations, many of which operate at capacity and report high rates of demand coinciding with wider economic pressures. I echo the recognition of these organisations' ongoing commitment and commend their professionalism in the face of systemic challenges.  

This case also brings to mind the broader societal context referenced in the report from the Windsor Safer Communities Partnership, which highlights the cumulative effect of acquisitive crime on perceptions of community safety and business confidence.  

The court is also mindful of recent academic research published by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies (2024), which articulates the link between precarious housing, economic insecurity, and acquisitive offending patterns. These interdependencies, while illuminating for policy and prevention, do not constitute a bar to sentencing proportional to offence seriousness.  

Broader Context and Procedural Observations  

It is regrettable — though hardly surprising — that securing prompt Legal Aid authorisation for your defence representation and expert reports caused some delay in the progression to hearing. Applications submitted on 30 March and subsequently on 7 May faced extended review periods, culminating in funding confirmation being granted only on 22 June 2025. Such delays regrettably add to the protracted nature of prosecutions and frustrate timely access to justice.  

This is an experience all too familiar to practitioners and courts alike. The system, once designed to facilitate fair and efficient proceedings, has become encumbered by layers of administrative oversight that too often amount to bureaucratic inertia and obfuscation. I record a note of frustration with the Legal Aid Agency, whose processes in this regard have been consistently criticised by bodies representing defendants and legal professionals.  

It is appropriate here to pay tribute to the efforts of defence counsel, Mr Oliver Starks, whose conduct has been both diligent and professionally courteous throughout. Likewise, thanks are owed to the Crown Advocate, Ms Bernice Cartwell, for her thorough and balanced presentation of the prosecution case.  

The courtroom facilities themselves have undergone recent refurbishment, improved lighting and audio-visual capacity aiding the presentation and review of video evidence—a boon in cases with high reliance on such media. The ushering and clerical staff in Court 5 have, as always, maintained order and efficiency with commendable professionalism during these proceedings.  

I would also note that the presence of victim liaison officers at the court has positively contributed to the support of witnesses, some of whom have significant anxieties about giving evidence. Their work in this sphere merits ongoing recognition.  

Returning to considerations of prosecutorial and investigatory efficiency, it is worth acknowledging that the Windsor Business Crime Reduction Partnership, despite issues of resource constraint and fluctuating membership active in some quarters, has effected a degree of multi-agency coordination during the investigation. Whether this coordination constitutes a sustainable model remains a question beyond this court’s remit, but its presence in this matter was certainly beneficial.  

Turning to the matter of plea, the deferment of your admission of guilt until the day of oral trial…  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

[Note: This appears a duplication—please observe that fact snippets are each unique and appear once. This is a formatting note; in the actual text, no repeated snippet occurs.]  

The court is mindful that sentence is to focus on the conduct before it, but in interpreting your background, it is also compelled to confront wider societal issues, including the ongoing challenges posed by street homelessness in this jurisdiction. Far from distant anecdote, these difficulties are experienced daily by vulnerable populations and often intersect with patterns of criminality.  

A particularly concerning trend is the normalisation of certain antisocial behaviours, including low-level acquisitive crime, which is too frequently trivialised in public discourse. There is no shortage of commentary decrying the rise in street begging and associated minor offences, often conflated in media narratives in ways that obscure the lived realities and reinforce stereotypes. These trends, while pressing, must not dilute individual accountability.  

The issue of public confidence in the judiciary has also been highlighted in recent consultations undertaken by the Judicial College. Public attitudes often vacillate between scepticism and trust; the latter is vital to the administration of justice but requires transparency and fairness in process. Yet there remains a perceptible disconnect between high-level imaging of the courts and the practical experience of victims and defendants. This court strives to bridge that gap through openness and reasoned explanation of decisions, such as these remarks.  

It is unfortunate that the media and broader public interest tend to favour sensational cases involving violence or notorious defendants, to the detriment of nuanced understanding of cumulative harms from persistent theft. Cases such as this may not attract headlines, but they are no less deserving of attention for the material impact on individuals and communities.  

The Sentencing Framework and Considerations  

The court adopts the guidelines as set forth by the Sentencing Council and reflects on the twin pillars of punishment and rehabilitation. Your offending falls squarely within the mid-to-high culpability bracket, with harm characterised as medium-to-high given the volume and persistence. The aggravating features — prior convictions, lack of genuine remorse until late plea, adverse victim impact — weigh heavily against mitigation.  

Mitigating considerations are limited. There is your guilty plea, albeit late, and some evidence of personal difficulties related to housing and employment. These, however, are not mitigating of your culpability but contextual factors pertinent to sentencing discretion. It remains the case that previous opportunities for intervention were afforded, and the offences reflect a conscious repeated disregard for the law and the wellbeing of those affected.  

The Probation Service will be requested to prepare a pre-sentence report including assessment of your suitability for community-based rehabilitation, potential cognitive behavioural programmes, and links to substance misuse services. Particular emphasis will be placed on compliance risks, engagement likelihood, and any ancillary support needs pertinent to resettlement and reintegration.  

The report will also address where unpaid work orders, financial penalties, or custodial sentences may best serve the interests of justice and public protection. The court will, of course, consider the full spectrum of dispositions relevant under the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  

To contextualise, it is noted that persistent offenders engaged in similar offending patterns frequently present with complex social factors, compounded by structural inequalities such as insecure housing, reduced educational attainment, and poor access to stable employment. These systemic issues do not diminish individual responsibility but invite a calibrated response balancing punishment and rehabilitation.  

In this vein, the court also recalls the guidance in R v. Finch [2019] EWCA Crim 2014, which emphasised the importance of proportionate sentencing tailored to individual circumstances but firmly rooted in public protection imperatives.  

Before concluding, I would also observe that persistent acquisitive offending—such as this—imposes a cumulative cost on public agencies, regulatory bodies, and voluntary sector organisations. Resources devoted to investigation, prosecution, and victim support could otherwise be channelled to more severe or emergent crimes, including violent and organised criminal activity. This opportunity cost is a factor duly considered within the proportionality and deterrence components of sentencing analysis.  

The conclusion of proceedings in this courtroom marks not only the imposition of sentence but also a signal that repeated offending at this scale commands a clear and unequivocal response from the criminal justice system.  

I reserve final sentencing for the formal hearing scheduled on 5 December 2025, pending receipt of any updated reports or representations. These are the sentencing remarks of Her Honour Judge L. F. Braithwaite, issued on 13 October 2025 in Court 5 at Windsor Crown Court. A formal transcript has been recorded under Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
