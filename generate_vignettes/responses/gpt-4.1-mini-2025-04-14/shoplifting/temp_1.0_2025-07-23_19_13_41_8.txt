IN THE CROWN COURT AT MIDDLESBOROUGH  
R v. MR H  
Case No. MB/CR/2025/14532  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. Rowntree  
Filed: 22 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence upon a charge of theft contrary to Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically a course of conduct involving shoplifting offences. The matters date from mid-2023 through to the spring of 2025, with incidents occurring predominantly within the Middlesborough Metropolitan area, encompassing retail outlets of varying size including some branded grocery chains and independent pharmacies.

Procedural History and Court Process  
You were first arrested on 19 April 2025 following a sustained and coordinated investigation by the Middlesborough Metropolitan Police Service in conjunction with the Retail Crime Alliance North-East. The police operation, initiated in early March, involved a combination of covert surveillance, the deployment of plain-clothed officers within suspect premises, and the analysis of multiple CCTV sources shared amongst partner agencies within the Business Crime Partnership framework. This partnership, albeit challenged by funding constraints and occasional inter-agency communication difficulties, was activated promptly after store managers reported an increasing frequency of missing stock and related security incidents.

Historically, the Theft Act 1968 has underpinned UK property offences for over half a century, with numerous judicial interpretations shaping its sentencing landscape. It is noted that the legislation has been supplemented in recent decades by the Sentencing Council’s guidelines, which emphasize proportionate responses tailored to the particular circumstances of each theft, including the value of property, the offender’s culpability, and any harm caused.

The initial police interviews conducted on 22 April 2025 saw you initially deny involvement. However, forensic analysis of recovered items and a pattern of witness statements linking you to locations under surveillance brought sufficient evidentiary weight to warrant a charge. The case was duly listed at Middlesborough Crown Court, with procedural hearings on 5 May and 12 June 2025 respectively. At the first occasion, representation was secured via Legal Aid, though it is pertinent to record that delays in approval for expert instruction were experienced, as noted in correspondence between defence counsel and the Legal Aid Agency dated late May and early June 2025. Such delays reflect systemic difficulties faced in accessing timely funding—a chronic issue raised in prior court communications—although, in this instance, the matter was managed without undue prolongation of proceedings.

In accordance with the Better Case Management (BCM) framework adopted throughout the Crown Court system, the case progressed through pre-trial listing swiftly. The Defence entered a not guilty plea at the June hearing, necessitating preparations for trial. Later, on 10 September 2025, a plea change to guilty was entered, following submission of additional evidence including a detailed forensic analyst report and statements from Retail Crime Investigators. The timing of the plea, shortly before trial, engages the well-established principle articulated in R v. Beckett [2019] EWCA Crim 1238, that late guilty pleas attract a limited discount as recognised in guidelines.

It is also appropriate to place on record the court’s appreciation for the efforts of the Middlesborough Retailers’ Support Network, whose proactive engagement with victim support and offender diversion initiatives have contributed significantly to restorative approaches in cases of low-level acquisitive crime. Their submissions in this matter, though brief, were forthright in conveying the cumulative economic and psychological impact on staff—often overlooked in the broader portrayal of such offences.

Moreover, the case has been affected by certain operational constraints typical of the current judicial climate, including a short adjournment caused by industrial action among Crown Court staff in July 2025, crowded listing schedules, and a temporary shortage of court interpreters, although these did not materially impede progress.

Noteworthy too is the submission from the National Association of Shopkeepers, expressing concern over the rising tide of retail crime and calling for enhanced community-based interventions alongside robust sentencing to deter persistent offenders. While the court recognises the policy context such representations provide, sentencing determinations must remain grounded in legal principles and individualized assessment.

The court acknowledges, regrettably, that similar cases often face delays attributable to limited forensic capacity within police laboratories. The doubling of workload has been documented in recent efficiency reports, reflecting increased volume and complexity in forensic requests. Nonetheless, here the police and prosecution teams managed to collate disclosure with reasonable expedition.

Historical case law remains instructive. For example, in R v. Gibbs [2020] EWCA Crim 1142, the defendant’s course of shoplifting involving multiple stores over eighteen months was deemed serious enough to warrant a custodial sentence, despite the relatively low unit values of each theft. The Court of Appeal emphasised that the repetitive nature and strategic planning underlying such offending elevates culpability. Although the particulars before this court differ, that principle carries persuasive weight.

Additionally, the well-known decision in R v. Lambert [2018] EWCA Crim 796 concerning the imposition of curfew and community orders in theft cases remains a touchstone for discretionary sentencing options, particularly where rehabilitation prospects exist alongside a manageable risk of reoffending.

In parallel, I note the application of the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline effective since 2021, which articulates categories of seriousness ranging from low (Category 1) to higher degrees (Category 3 or 4) where either the risk or harm is exacerbated. The cumulative value of stolen goods in this case and the repeated breaches of prohibitive measures will inform placement within this framework.

Regrettably, I cannot ignore ongoing systemic challenges in mental health service delivery as it relates to offenders presenting with behavioural difficulties. The local NHS Trust’s Community Forensic Psychiatry service continues to report high demand and protracted waiting lists. The pre-sentence psychiatric assessment awaited in this case has been submitted within the past fortnight, but the impact of such delays on timely justice is noted with concern.

A Report from the Middlesborough Probation Service, prepared by Officer Sergeant Rachel Milner, outlined broad psychosocial concerns common among repeat acquisitive offenders, particularly those compounded by unstable housing and employment status. However, resource limitations within Probation—themselves amplified by recent staffing deficiencies—hamper deeper casework. Such systemic observations, while relevant for policy reflection, do not mitigate personal responsibility.

The facts of the case are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

Having outlined the procedural and institutional context, I proceed to consider the factual circumstances of your offending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

You are 34 years of age. Your criminal record includes three prior convictions for shoplifting offences between 2018 and 2022, for which you received community penalties on each occasion. Your current residence is in temporary social housing, arranged following eviction from previous accommodation due to rent arrears.

It is of significance that your engagement with support services has been patchy. The psychiatric evaluation obtained at the court’s instruction has concluded you do not suffer from any enduring mental disorder, but does note elements of low mood, anxiety, and impulsivity, which may influence your behavioural responses.

The domestic circumstances provided by letter from your sister, Mrs A., indicate a history complicated by fractured relationships and social isolation. Voluntary sector reports, including those from the North East Community Outreach team, document your brief engagement with drug and alcohol counselling, though no confirmed ongoing substance misuse.

The particular vulnerabilities that may attend such a psychosocial profile are well recognised in criminal justice literature. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for managing offenders with mental health vulnerabilities advocate multi-agency collaboration, which this prosecution and probation process have valiantly attempted though constrained by competing demands.

You attended court unaccompanied today, and your written plea letter was submitted via your counsel. The fairly restrained tone of that document is noted, although—while it expresses regret—the letter is careful not to attribute your behaviour to any specific identifiable cause.

By comparison, the voluminous victim impact statements from affected retail outlets paint a different picture—one of disruption, diminished staff morale, and loss of revenue. One manager notes the imposition of costly security upgrades and the need to reduce store hours in response to ongoing thefts. Another describes the anxiety suffered by part-time staff, many of whom are young and inexperienced.

I note that the West Middlesborough Pharmacy Voice group has made representations concerning the particular challenges facing pharmacies, including the pharmacy signposting duty to report repeat offenders and the resultant impact on vulnerable customers seeking medication.

Other cases from the jurisdiction serve as reminders of the nuanced approach required to balance rehabilitation and public protection. For example, R v. Patel [2023] EWCA Crim 1567 involved theft from a retail outlet by a defendant with diagnosed bipolar disorder. There, the Court upheld a community order with a mental health treatment requirement, highlighting the need for carefully tailored sentences.

Contrast that with R v. Sharp [2024] EWCA Crim 2102, involving persistent petty thefts from multiple outlets. The defendant’s disregard for prior warnings and multiple breaches of community orders resulted in immediate custodial sentences being upheld on appeal, underscoring the consequences of recidivism without engagement.

It is in this context that I must consider the appropriate sentencing options. Community-based orders remain available and should be explored, particularly given your stated lack of stable employment and housing. However, the court is conscious of the need for deterrence and the protection of victims and the public, balanced with your personal rehabilitation prospects.

Modern probation practice increasingly emphasises the benefits of cognitive behavioural programmes targeted at acquisitive offenders, including thinking skills workshops and financial management courses. It is hoped that such interventions, combined with housing stability and mental health support, may reduce your risk of reoffending.

The court has seen no evidence of any involvement in organised criminal activity or complicity in larger-scale theft rings. Nor is there any indication of violence or coercive behaviour associated with your offending.

I am obliged to mention that the Court’s administrative officer brought to my attention a recent public inquiry into the capacity of multi-agency public safety initiatives in the region. The Inquiry’s report highlights chronic underfunding and the pressure on front-line staff, which, while not determinative here, inevitably colours the backdrop against which criminal cases must be considered.

The facts of your offending conduct are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

I have also taken into account several letters of support from staff at local voluntary organisations providing housing advice and food bank services, demonstrating ongoing willingness to assist you should you seek their help. Moreover, the probation service has indicated its intention to assess your suitability for a Community Rehabilitation Order with a tailored activity requirement.

Notwithstanding these mitigating efforts, the Crown has fairly pointed out the cumulative offence pattern, the impact on multiple victims, and your history of previous convictions, which tend to diminish the prospects for leniency.

Additionally, the court notes the absence of a demonstrated readiness on your part to engage proactively with support until formal court involvement.

While the moral and social backdrop of current retail crime trends is complex, the law must be administered impartially. This court echoes concerns expressed in social commentary about the increasing normalisation of petty thefts in some urban areas, exacerbating the strain on police and retail sectors alike.

It is an unfortunate reality that many retail staff have been subjected to verbal abuse and intimidation in other cases, sometimes escalating to assaults involving weapons, though no such aggravating factors are present here.

Cases dealing with aggravated breaches, including possession of offensive weapons in retail premises or use of violence against security personnel—as exemplified in R v. Johnson [2022] EWCA Crim 1890—are, fortunately, not germane to your matter.

The court also recognises that repeat theft cases sometimes entail involvement of other defendants with distinct offending profiles. No co-defendants are linked to your case, although investigation records do note an unrelated concurrent prosecution involving attempted burglary by another individual in the same vicinity, who was apprehended separately.

The presence of multiple unrelated criminal proceedings in the district, including a forthcoming trial concerning serious arson offences in Court 5, serves to remind us of the spectrum of offending confronting the justice system, amplifying the demands on judicial resources and the imperative of efficient case management.

Returning to your situation, the facts reflect a deliberate and premeditated course of action targeting vulnerable retail outlets. Staff have reported alterations to working patterns, heightened security measures, and a pervasive sense of wariness. Although there was no physical violence, the psychological and economic toll ought not be underestimated.

The relevant statutory framework and sentencing principles thus direct the court to consider a balanced approach incorporating punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection.

The facts relevant to sentencing include:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

The psychiatric input received, while limited in scope, advises some caution. Your impulsivity and low mood may contribute to offending behaviour, but do not amount to mental illness exempting you from full accountability. The court acknowledges the commendable clarity and detail provided in Dr Samantha Khalil’s report dated 10 October 2025. Notably, distinctions are made between clinical diagnoses and psychosocial factors, aiding judicial evaluation.

Also reflected in the pre-sentence report, the local probation officer remarks upon your “minimal engagement” with prior community sentences and a reluctance to establish stable tenancy arrangements, a concern for effective supervision.

Your prior record of acquisitive crime, including a community order granted in 2021 which you prematurely breached, is a further aggravating marker.

It is worth recalling, albeit tangentially, the holdings in R v. Whitehall [2017] EWCA Crim 1242, concerning possession of a bladed article in a school parking area, which resulted in restrictive custodial sentence due to the high public safety risks. While factually unrelated, such cases underscore the court’s focus on harm, risk, and repetition.

Moreover, reference might again be made to the difficulties encountered by police in tracing offenders when co-defendants abscond, which complicates prosecutions. Fortunately, your case involves no such absences.

Anecdotal observations by members of this court highlight the challenge posed by the increasing normalisation of social media culture tolerant of minor offences, and the corresponding shift in public attitudes. Whether this contributes to offending or not is a matter for wider societal discourse, but it forms a silent undercurrent here.

In sum, the facts disclose:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

The submissions advanced by your counsel emphasise your personal difficulties, including housing insecurity and unemployment. They also highlight the professional reports’ acknowledgment of your “potential for constructive change,” whilst conceding the challenge posed by repeated prior opportunities not taken.

The Defence has argued for a community order incorporating a rehabilitative programme addressing financial management and impulse control, supported by probation supervision.

The Crown stresses the need to reflect the seriousness and persistence of offending, and while accepting the late guilty plea, urges a sentence which upholds the message that recidivist retail theft will be met with appropriately firm consequences.

It is the court’s responsibility to weigh all these factors, mindful of the statutory guidance and judicial precedents.

Today’s hearing has been conducted in open court. I thank Ms Louise Harding for her careful and balanced submissions on behalf of the Crown, and Mr Declan Byrne for his diligent advocacy on behalf of the defendant, who continues to enjoy Legal Aid representation. I must, on the other hand, express my continuing concern regarding the constraints imposed by administrative delays in securing funding for expert reports. The Justice Ministry’s recent briefing note acknowledges these systemic issues but offers no immediate remedy.

The court’s focus remains fixed on achieving a sentencing order commensurate with the severity of the offending, the circumstances of the defendant, and the overarching objectives of justice.

At this stage, no definitive sentence is imposed. Instead, I will direct that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared. This report shall address risk factors, the availability and appropriateness of community interventions—including cognitive behavioural therapy, employment and housing support, and restorative justice opportunities—and assess compliance likelihood.

The court stresses the importance of addressing criminogenic needs to reduce future harm and maximise public safety.

The sentencing hearing will be reconvened following receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further representations.

These sentencing remarks are issued this 22nd day of October 2025, in Court 4 at Middlesborough Crown Court. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed according to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of any sentence imposed under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 section 49 are engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
