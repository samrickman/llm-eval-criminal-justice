IN THE CROWN COURT AT LINCOLN  
R v. MR H  
Case No. LCN/2025/4812  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge P. A. DEIGHTON  
Filed: 13 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction on a charge of theft by shoplifting under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending in question took place between the autumn of 2023 and early spring of 2025 across a range of retail premises situated within the greater Lincolnshire area, including several small and medium-sized shops in the central commercial districts and suburban neighbourhoods. The matter has been the subject of a protracted procedural trajectory culminating in today’s hearing.

Procedural History and Court Process  
The defendants’ first appearance in these proceedings was on 5 November 2024, when charges were preferred following investigation by the Lincolnshire Constabulary’s Retail Crime Unit, coordinated with officers from the Business Crime Strategy Team. This was the outcome of a months-long inquiry triggered by a series of reports from local shops experiencing unusually frequent stock shortages accompanied by targeted surveillance. What initially appeared to be isolated incidents were ultimately linked via meticulous collation of CCTV footage and witness testimony.

As with many such matters, progress was somewhat hindered by a series of administrative obstacles, most noticeably delays in obtaining Legal Aid funding for the instruction of expert reports. The defence made repeated applications for funding to engage a forensic psychologist, whose assessment was deemed necessary to provide insight into issues of culpability and risk. Regrettably, the Legal Aid Agency’s response was not forthcoming without extensive prompting, and the process took some eight weeks longer than anticipated, underscoring systemic challenges facing practitioners within the criminal justice framework.

Listing difficulties also played their part. The case was initially listed for plea and trial preparation hearing on 15 February 2025 but required adjournment on account of the prosecution’s need to serve additional evidential material, including new CCTV footage recovered from a store located in Gainsborough, which reinforced the narrative of a patterned offending behaviour. These developments are typical of multi-count theft cases, where evidential accrual often proceeds incrementally across several precincts.

The Better Case Management (BCM) protocols were rigorously applied in this instance, and I commend all parties for their efforts to maintain timetables as far as practicable. Such cooperation is vital in ensuring that delays do not become excessive and that victims’ interests are properly balanced against defendants’ rights to a fair and timely hearing.

I also record my thanks to Ms Natalie Frey, who appears for the Crown, and Mr Dean Walsh, representing you under a Legal Aid order. Their professional conduct has been exemplary throughout what has been, by any measure, a somewhat complex procedural path.

The case came before this court for trial over two sitting days, following which you entered a guilty plea to a single representative count, acknowledging responsibility for the aggregate conduct alleged.

It is important to observe that your late admission, while appreciated, occurred only after the evidence had been fully deployed by the Crown, including witness statements and forensic results. As established in R v. Whitfield [2019] EWCA Crim 1605, late pleas attract a reduced credit to reflect the delay in accepting responsibility and the additional burden placed on the justice system.

    

The social backdrop against which these offences took place warrants some comment. Over recent years, Lincolnshire, like many other regions, has experienced a notable increase in recorded retail theft incidents. Official data from the Lincolnshire Police Annual Crime Report 2024 revealed a 14% rise in shoplifting offences compared to the previous year, placing significant strain on policing and community resources. This has been accompanied by concerns regarding rising street homelessness and the visible presence of individuals engaged in begging and other minor antisocial behaviour within key urban centres.

Such trends are not isolated or novel, as recognised in the wider sociological literature. Furedi (2020) identified a gradual but inexorable erosion of communal ties, with economic precarity and social fragmentation contributing to an environment in which acquisitive offences, particularly among vulnerable populations, have become both more frequent and more complex. The court must remain cognisant of these wider forces, whilst preserving focus on individual accountability.

Against this milieu, the importance of multi-agency collaboration in managing reoffending risk cannot be overstated. The Lincolnshire Business Crime Reduction Partnership, established in 2017 as an umbrella framework for coordination between retail operators, police, local councils, and victim support agencies, has pioneered a number of intervention programmes. These range from offender engagement panels to targeted surveillance and premise-specific crime prevention initiatives.

The circumstances of your arrest on 18 March 2025 involved officers acting on anonymous tip-offs, coordinated via the Crime Reduction Partnership’s intelligence unit. The vigilance of store staff and prompt liaison with neighbourhood policing teams facilitated your apprehension shortly after the latest alleged offence. At interview, conducted under caution at Lincoln Police Station, you initially denied wrongdoing but later admitted to the thefts when confronted with incontrovertible CCTV evidence.  

Although not a feature of your case, it bears mention that the court recently considered in R v. Egerton [2024] EWCA Crim 703 the issue of offender culpability where mental disorder was present but did not absolve responsibility. There, the defendant, diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, had committed multiple acts of arson with potentially catastrophic consequences. The Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence of four years, observing that therapeutic need must be balanced against public protection, particularly when behaviour demonstrated deliberate disregard for risk.

    

Your case is plainly distinguishable, but these authoritative pronouncements underpin the framework within which the sentencing process operates.

Victim impact statements received from several retailers provide a window into some of the consequences of sustained shop theft, even when unaccompanied by physical violence. Employees described feelings of anxiety, fear, and demoralisation, compounded by the perception that security measures were insufficient to protect them during their shifts. One manager reported a 20% increase in stock security expenditure following repeated losses, alongside a decline in staff morale and a higher turnover rate linked to stress.

The presence of such harm is reinforced by correspondence from the Lincolnshire Retail Staff Support Network, a voluntary organisation offering counselling and advocacy services to workers affected by acquisitive crime. Their recent letter highlighted the difficulty of staff in managing the combined pressures of understaffing, anxious customers, and disproportionate exposure to crime events. These factors, though intangible, are real and shape perceptions of safety within commercial environments.

You have provided a written statement to the court, expressing regret for your conduct and citing a range of personal difficulties, including unemployment, unstable housing, and familial estrangement. These matters were explored in some detail within the psychiatric report furnished by Dr Peter Singleton, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed on behalf of the defence.

Dr Singleton’s report, commissioned in April 2025, is both measured and professionally composed. It considers your mental state, cognitive functioning, and potential factors ameliorating culpability. Notably, it concludes that while you exhibit features consistent with mild depression and a background of adverse childhood experiences, there is no diagnosable major mental disorder. The report also refers to occasional substance misuse, specifically alcohol, although on a non-dependent basis.

Dr Singleton emphasises your expressed motivation for offending as financially driven — a response to material deprivation — but underscores an apparent ambivalence toward engagement with support services, which your history corroborates.

    

In terms of risk, the psychiatrist suggests that while the likelihood of reoffending is moderate, structured intervention in the community setting could provide meaningful mitigation, particularly if combined with vocational support and psychological therapy aimed at improving self-efficacy and delaying gratification.

One must pause to note the wider resource constraints experienced by probation and mental health services locally. The rightly laudable goals of a multi-disciplinary approach to offender management are limited by longstanding staffing shortages, high caseloads, and growing demand. Waiting times for community mental health assessments have escalated to some eight months on average, a regrettable fact that inevitably affects the pace and comprehensiveness of interventions.

Nonetheless, the court acknowledges the positive impact achieved by dedicated officers and clinicians who continue to provide valuable services under these difficult conditions.

On that note, I extend my gratitude to Ms Angela Parkes, probation officer assigned to this case, for her detailed pre-sentence report. Her constructive engagement and clear analysis have greatly assisted the court in understanding the complexities at play.

    

In addition, letters of support from the Linwood Homelessness Outreach Charity and the East Midlands Welfare Advice Centre attest to your intermittent contact with emergency accommodation and benefit advice, albeit marked by inconsistency.

Turning to relevant jurisprudence, the Court is mindful of the principles articulated in the Sentencing Council’s Theft and Handling guideline (effective from July 2023), which specifies the importance of considering the value, level of planning, and impact on victims when determining the gravity of offending.

Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the statutory underpinning, defining theft as “dishonestly appropriating property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive”.

In R v. Daley [2022] EWCA Crim 1560, the Court of Appeal emphasised the necessity of proportionate response to theft committed over a course of conduct, paying heed to aggravating factors such as repeat offending, exploitation of vulnerable victims, and failure to engage with prior rehabilitative efforts.

Although Daley concerned higher-value theft offences with direct elements of coercion, the principle that cumulative impact matters clearly applies.

Similarly, R v. Jessop [2020] EWCA Crim 1124, arising from a string of burglaries of vacant residential properties, reaffirmed that sentences should reflect not just the material damage but the broader community harm and erosion of confidence occasioned by repeated intrusion.

While those cases are factually distinct and involve different kinds of offending, they illustrate the court’s calibrated approach to valuation and harm.

    

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

    

I also draw attention to R v. Foster [2018] EWCA Crim 1084, in which the defendant’s conduct involved theft of metal cabling from a railway depot causing substantial operational disruption and safety concerns. The Court of Appeal confirmed that economic cost is but one facet of harm, which must be considered alongside disruption to public utilities and the risk posed to personnel.

While unrelated materially to your case, this decision highlights the judiciary’s attentive approach to the broader ramifications of acquisitive offences.

Of note, co-defendants in other cases heard recently in this jurisdiction have faced charges including possession of a bladed article in a school car park (R v. Matthews, unreported, 2025) and acts of affray involving pool cues in a public house setting (R v. Thornton, Notts CC, 2024). Though these issues bear no direct relevance to your conduct, they serve as a reminder of the wide-ranging nature of offences considered by this court.

    

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

    

As to mitigation, defence counsel submits that your unstable housing arrangements, expressed remorse, and previous unblemished records for violence justify a community-focused disposal incorporating rehabilitative measures.

The court is mindful that you have pleaded guilty at the first realistic opportunity post-trial, which entitles you, prima facie, to some credit.

Nonetheless, the Crown rightly submits that prior warnings, a history of low-level offending, and failure to sustain engagement with voluntary programmes necessitate a stern response.

    

Reflecting on your personal circumstances, it is apparent that notwithstanding assistance offered by social and welfare agencies, including sessions with the Lincolnshire Housing Forum and crisis intervention units, your social network remains fragile. Family relationships are distant, and employment is intermittent.

While these factors do not excuse offence, they are relevant to the assessment of personal mitigation and risk.

The court notes with some concern evidence that you turned down referrals to community addiction services, despite occasional alcohol misuse detected during medical screening.

    

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

    

The cumulative picture suggests an individual caught in a cycle of financial and social instability, marked by repeated petty offending as a maladaptive coping mechanism.

The court’s primary objective is to impose a sentence that delivers punishment, deterrence—both personal and general—and facilitates rehabilitation to diminish the likelihood of future harm.

In this connection, the probation pre-sentence report recommends consideration of a community order, incorporating a rehabilitation activity requirement, cognitive skills programme, and attendance at an accredited substance misuse referral, if compliance is achievable.

Conversely, a custodial sentence would be reserved for cases exhibiting serious aggravation, violation of trust, or sustained recidivism. Given your history and the facts admitted, the court leans towards a community measure, pending full consideration of the presentence report.

    

I am aware that repeated acquisitive offending, especially shop theft targeting small businesses, places an ongoing burden not only on individual victims but also on wider commerce and policing efforts. The cumulative costs—both financial and psychological—are substantial.

The court wishes to acknowledge the continued efforts of local policing teams and the Lincolnshire Retailers’ Association in supporting business owners and shop workers.

Similarly, the dedication of voluntary services, such as the Lincolnshire Substance Misuse Partnership and the Criminal Justice Liaison and Diversion scheme, merits recognition for their role in addressing underlying factors contributing to offending behaviour at an early stage.

    

It bears reminder that the claimant in a recent local case, R v. Gibbons [2025] LCN 5041, was convicted of fly-tipping on protected green belt land resulting in significant environmental damage—a different offence but one which demonstrates this court’s firm stance against persistent offending of any kind.

Likewise, the case of R v. Rhodes [2019] EWCA Crim 582, involved a co-defendant who failed to appear for trial and later was apprehended on charges of possessing indecent images, a separate matter with no bearing on you.

These, and similar instances, illustrate the complexity and diversity of cases managed within this jurisdiction, though they bear no direct relevance here.

    

The hearing today has been conducted in open court with all procedural safeguards observed. The public gallery was sparsely attended, a phenomenon lamented by many who argue that the slow accumulation of low-level offending neither attracts nor commands the scrutiny it merits, which may contribute to a diminished sense of visibility around issues of petty acquisitive crime.

Such cases lack the spectacle or drama of headline-making trials but carry profound implications for the lived experience of community safety.

I emphasise that the court does not diminish the seriousness with which it treats these offences. The trauma or anxiety experienced by retail assistants and proprietors—many of whom have little recourse or resources to cope—is very real.

    

In formulating this decision, I also reflect on the evolving sentencing landscape. The Sentencing Council periodically reviews guidelines and practice directions, ensuring that judicial responses remain proportionate and evidence-informed.

The principles set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, especially in relation to rehabilitation and the use of community orders, guide the court’s discretion in appropriate cases.

Public interest requires that sanctions communicate the unacceptability of repeated theft, that deterrence must be effective, and that rehabilitation remains a central tenet of sentencing policy.

    

Accordingly, I shall adjourn this matter to enable the probation service to prepare and submit a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing your circumstances, risk indicators, and rehabilitation potential.

The report should also explore the suitability and availability of specific accredited programmes and any community payback options, including unpaid work requirements, if appropriate.

I remind you that the sentencing decision is reserved for the forthcoming date of 25 November 2025, when all relevant reports and representations will have been considered.

    

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 13 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court in Lincoln. The formal record of conviction will be transmitted to the probation and sentencing registry in due course.

You are advised of your statutory right to appeal the sentencing decision within 28 days under the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, section 49, are considered necessary or engaged in this matter.

Costs are reserved for determination at the subsequent hearing.

These are the orders of the court.
