IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEICESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. LU/2025/3449  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge P. J. Lewin  
Filed: 11 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction on a charge arising from repeated offences of theft from retail premises, committed over a protracted period in the Leicester city area. The offences before the court are alleged contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, occurring intermittently between October 2023 and March 2025.

Procedural History  
Your case arrived at this court as part of the Crown Court’s expanding caseload relating to acquisitive offences. These cases, often representing persistent patterns of offending involving comparatively low individual monetary values, nonetheless place a significant cumulative strain on the justice system and communities alike. Reflecting the progressive reforms prompted by the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative under Part 3 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, the prosecution, defence, and court alike have sought to adhere to prescribed timelines for evidence gathering, disclosure, and plea determination. It is worth recording for the professional record that this case, unlike many others of similar nature, has not experienced wholly exceptional delay, notwithstanding some adjournments requested by the defence for further disclosure and expert assessment.

You were arrested on 7 April 2025, following a coordinated investigatory effort involving Leicester City Police’s Retail Crime Reduction Unit in conjunction with employees of the affected retail chains and the Leicester Safer Neighbourhoods Team. Such investigations, as we are all too aware, embody a disproportionate demand on specialist and frontline law enforcement resources. The administration of evidence gathering, including the careful extraction and preservation of digital security footage, statements from multiple witnesses whose recollection diminishes with time, and the forensic analysis of physical exhibits, entails an expenditure of time and public funds which—while necessary—cannot be overstated. In the absence of heightened risk or grave violence, these matters are often relegated lower on priority lists within overstretched police departments, which further extends timelines.  

A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 15 May 2025, following initial bail conditions which were appropriately monitored by the Probation Service. It is noted that the defence initially entered a not guilty plea but later amended this to a guilty plea on 2 June 2025, just prior to the scheduled trial. This late plea follows a familiar pattern criticised in appellate jurisprudence, notably R v. Bannister [2020] EWCA Crim 438, where the Court of Appeal emphasised that credit for guilty pleas must be properly calibrated to reflect timing alongside genuine remorse and procedural economy.  
The essentials of that judgement find pertinent application here and set a cautionary benchmark regarding the extent of mitigation credit available to defendants who delay admission until the imminent commencement of trial.  

It is regrettable to observe that delays arose, in part, due to the protracted process of securing funding and expert instructions from the Legal Aid Agency. Applications made in late March for an independent forensic psychiatric assessment encountered apparently avoidable bureaucratic inertia, necessitating multiple communications by defence solicitors. Such procedural obstructions are not unique to this case but are symptomatic of system-wide strain that undermines efficient case progression and equitable access to justice. This court expresses formal displeasure at the continuing frequency of such impediments.  

A detailed psychiatric report was, ultimately, commissioned from Dr Imogen Fearnley, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose findings were received on 21 August 2025. Dr Fearnley’s comprehensive assessment, involving clinical interview, psychometric testing, and history review, provides insight into your mental state and any contributory factors, albeit without establishing a condition warranting diminished culpability within the legal framework. The Probation Service has since been requested to prepare a pre-sentence report in light of the expert’s observations and other relevant material.

Public and Institutional Impacts  
The court must briefly reflect on the wider social infrastructure impacted by offences such as these. Retail premises — particularly smaller, independent shops operating on narrow margins — bear a disproportionate burden from persistent theft. This leads to economic loss, staffing disruptions, and increased security measures that themselves can affect customer experience and staff wellbeing. The Retail Crime Reduction Partnerships formed in Leicester and elsewhere seek to address these harms through multi-agency collaboration, mutual intelligence sharing among retailers and law enforcement, and early intervention strategies. However, effectiveness is frequently hampered by fluctuating personnel, incomplete data exchange, and limited funding.

Furthermore, the pressures on Probation Services tasked with supervising defendants at risk of reoffending have intensified markedly over recent years. Personnel shortages and escalating caseloads mean that supervisory contact is often less frequent and interventions less personalised than ideal. The recent annual report of the Midlands Probation Trust highlighted an alarming growth in workload and a worrisome decline in service capacity, with early release and community disposal cases particularly vulnerable to inadequate monitoring.  

Meanwhile, NHS mental health trusts continue to experience record waiting times and resource constraints across adult community mental health services, with many relying heavily on third-sector organisations to bridge gaps in psychological and social support. Charitable entities such as the Leicester Foodbank Network and a consortium of homelessness outreach projects — though commendably dedicated — are stretched perilously thin, operating under constant financial uncertainty.  
These systemic realities form an unavoidable backdrop to cases such as yours and provide essential context without negating personal responsibility.

Legal and Sentencing Context  
The offence charged is theft, defined by section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive. Theft from retail premises, colloquially “shoplifting,” encompasses a wide range of conduct—from isolated opportunistic acts to sustained campaigns of concealment and subterfuge. The courts have evolved a nuanced sentencing approach that distinguishes between casual, one-off incidents and calculated, repeated behaviour targeting vulnerable outlets or employees.  

Sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council in 2019 guide judicial discretion by categorising theft by harm level, degree of planning, and culpability. Aggravating features include previous convictions for similar offences, use of deception or violence, targeting of disabled or elderly victims, and involvement with organised offending groups. Mitigation may be found in early guilty pleas, genuine engagement with rehabilitative services, absence of prior convictions, and evident remorse.

The Court of Appeal has provided instructive authority on sentencing shoplifting and related offences. In R v. Chappell [2017] EWCA Crim 2515 the court underscored the serious impact that persistent theft can have upon small retailers, particularly where cumulative losses threaten business viability. Equally, in R v. Sheppard [2020] EWCA Crim 950, the court recognised that a defendant’s vulnerability and special needs may warrant adapted sentencing approaches but affirmed that these factors do not excuse deliberate, repeated offending.

You will be sentenced for the course of conduct encapsulated within the representative charge brought. The facts outlined below, while indicative and illustrative, provide the necessary foundation for applying sentencing principles and for assessing culpability, harm, and risk of further offending.

The modus operandi revealed a pattern of calculated concealment and avoidance of detection spanning a variety of store locations, times, and product types. Notably, the hallmark of this offending was repetition and persistence despite prior cautions and community resolution orders. The offence rate cannot be characterised as sporadic but rather as a deliberate course of conduct.

A further factor complicating matters was your repeated use of diversionary tactics, including feigning telephone conversations and altering appearance to evade identification. Such strategies were observed on multiple security recordings, and speak to offensive awareness, negating claims of opportunism or ignorance.

From evidence before the court, your offending traces a trajectory commencing within earlier periods of relative stability, which progressively morphed into repeated intrusions on store staff's peace of mind. The psychological toll on victims should not be minimized; victim impact statements reveal how the offending has necessitated store policy changes, including increased locking of shelving units and revision of staffing patterns. The cumulative coercive effect of repeated presence, even absent overt aggression, has been described as intimidating by several witnesses.

The ramifications also extend to commercial viability. One local family-run grocer reported losses estimated at around £3,000, alongside a decline in shopper numbers attributable to fears about security and personnel turnover. This economic damage, while perhaps modest in isolation, has a cumulative regional impact that cannot be overlooked.

Despite previous attempts by community policing teams to engage you in diversion schemes and tailored support interventions, there was a regrettable regression into recurring offending, which this court must view with concern.

Expert Reports and Psychological Assessment  
The psychiatric report authored by Dr Fearnley provides a clear clinical portrait, diagnosing prominent symptoms of depressogenic disorder and impulsivity traits but explicitly ruling out psychotic illness or significant cognitive impairment. She notes your limited insight into the consequences of your conduct and low engagement with prior community support offers. The report highlights stressors relating to financial hardship and social isolation but concludes that these conditions do not amount to diminished responsibility or grounds for avoiding sanctions.  

While sympathetic to your personal challenges, this court is constrained to weigh the clinical findings alongside the broader public interest in deterrence and rehabilitation. Your recent assessment within probation records notes ambivalence about addressing underlying issues and inconsistent cooperation with offender managers, which carries implications for sentence planning.

Relevant case law, including R v. Isaacson [2019] EWCA Crim 731, underscores that where psychiatric factors do not fundamentally alter culpability or risk, they are best dealt with through sentencing dispositions incorporating appropriate community or hospital conditions rather than as grounds for mitigation.

Sentencing Options and Considerations  
The statutory sentencing framework allows a range of disposals spanning fines, community orders, suspended sentences, and immediate custodial sentences, depending on factors such as culpability, harm, and risk. The court must also reflect on ancillary matters of licence conditions, rehabilitation activity requirements, and potential restorative justice interventions.

Given the circumstances, including your background and expert assessments, community sentences with intensive supervision may be considered subject to the probation report's recommendations. However, the persistence and planning evident here clearly warrant sentences that emphasise deterrence and protection of the public.

I direct that a full pre-sentence report be prepared in advance of final sentencing, with specific attention to viable rehabilitative programmes addressing acquisitive offending, impulsivity, financial management, and mental health support. The potential inclusion of unpaid work and curfew orders should also be explored.

It is fitting to note, before concluding, that this hearing has been conducted in open court with proper attendance by all parties. I acknowledge the professional contributions of Ms Eleanor Fitzpatrick, who appears for the prosecution, and Mr Daniel Graves, counsel instructed on your behalf under a Legal Aid representation order. I also wish to commend the court staff of the Leicester Crown Court for maintaining order and proceeding with due diligence despite the pressures on judicial resources and a recent refurbishment of court facilities which introduced some temporary logistical challenges.

There has been no application for reporting restrictions, and the usual protocols regarding media access have been observed. I note for the record that the Public Guardian’s office has recently emphasised the importance of openness in such property-related cases to maintain public trust.

I reserve final sentence until all requested reports and representations have been received.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 11 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Leicester. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal this sentence within 28 days of pronouncement, under the provisions of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are in force here. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
