IN THE CROWN COURT AT CROYDON  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. T2025/14839  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J. Ellery  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence upon a charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically in relation to persistent shoplifting offences over a protracted period. The offending alleged occurred principally in and around the Croydon borough, spanning the months from late 2023 to early 2025. This court convenes today following a plea entered at the preparatory hearing on 7 October, following a period of protracted case management and evidential preparation.

Procedural History and Case Management  
Your arrest took place on 18 March 2025, subsequent to a month-long covert operation involving multiple partnerships between local law enforcement, commercial premises security personnel, and the Croydon Business Crime Reduction Forum. This forum, as the court has previously noted in similar cases, acts as a pivotal locus for information-sharing between stakeholders invested in retail crime reduction, encompassing retail managers, community safety officers, and constabulary analysts. The operation, utilising enhanced CCTV surveillance, electronic point-of-sale data analysis, and manual recording sheets compiled by store employees, uncovered a consistent pattern of theft in several small- and medium-sized retail establishments including convenience stores, pharmacy chains, and boutique grocers.

The process of assembling evidence was neither swift nor facile. Retail theft cases often impose significant strain upon already stretched investigative resources. The need to collate hours of digital footage, assemble chain-of-custody logs, and secure detailed, contemporaneous witness statements invariably requires a level of commitment that belies the frequently modest financial value of stolen goods. In this context, it is worth acknowledging the remarkable dedication of the officers and civilian personnel responsible for investigating these matters, who must balance such priorities amidst competing demands from much graver serious crime domains. The court is also cognisant that this investigation occurred during a period of particularly high sustained operational pressure, with regional police forces contending with parallel inquiries into serious violent offences and gang-related criminality.

The case entered the Crown Court in accordance with the Better Case Management (BCM) framework under the Criminal Procedure Rules. Timely scheduling of preliminary hearings, disclosure processing, and evidential updates took place within prescribed intervals, though not without challenge. The court registrar has reported several administrative delays due to clerical errors in disclosure indexing, necessitating brief adjournments on 12 June and 17 September. These procedural hiccups, while regrettable, were minor and have not impeded substantive progress.

At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 7 October, you, through your instructing solicitor, Mr Piers Worthington of Bellamy & Co., entered a plea of guilty on the basis of the prosecution’s representative count, reflecting a course of conduct rather than isolated incidents.

Failing to secure an early guilty plea has become a depressingly frequent occurrence across the criminal justice landscape. While the principle of innocent until proven guilty remains sacrosanct, the court must recognise that late admissions of guilt, particularly after comprehensive investigative and preparatory investments, run counter to the interests of efficiency, victims, and wider public confidence. The Court of Appeal has been thorough in reiterating this in cases including R v. Simmons [2019] EWCA Crim 2340, emphasising that the temporal positioning of a plea carries considerable weight in discount calculations.

It is customary for the court to thank counsel appearing today: Ms Helena Drummond for the Crown, whose presentation was measured and professional, and Mr Worthington, who provided conscientious and diligent representation under a Legal Aid order.

The nature of the offending, as it has emerged from the evidence, is characterised by a repeated and methodical removal of a range of items which, while individually of limited pecuniary value, cumulatively represent a serious breach of the trust afforded by commercial proprietors and a source of ongoing distress to staff. The court is aware that such offences often have cascading negative effects: increased security outlays, staff turnover due to stress and anxiety, and damage to the fabric of community retail spaces.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

It is necessary to contextualise this pattern of behaviour within the existing legal framework that informs sentencing for theft. The Theft Act 1968 remains the definitive legislative instrument. Importantly, section 1 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. The Crown must establish these mental elements beyond reasonable doubt, all of which have been satisfied on the evidence.

The Sentencing Council offers a detailed guideline on theft offences, updated most recently in 2024, which sets out a range of factors that bear upon the categorisation of harm, culpability, and aggravation. Key considerations include the method of theft, the vulnerability of victims, the sophistication and planning evident in the offending, and the circumstances of the offender.

In this instance, the offences represent a sustained course, with indications of premeditation and repeat targeting of vulnerable premises. There is, however, an absence of violence or threats, and no indication of organised crime involvement or gang association.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

The court notes that your criminal record includes a modest number of convictions, principally related to similar acquisitive offences spanning the past six years. Notably, there is no current or prior recorded custodial sentence, but a history of community resolutions and conditional discharges, reflecting a degree of leniency previously extended in the hope of promoting rehabilitation.

The pre-sentence reports commissioned by the probation service provide a nuanced picture. The court has afforded great weight to the assessments provided by Senior Probation Officer Ms Yasmin Khatri, whose report emphasizes a number of risk factors and mitigation points relevant to sentencing. Despite your expressed willingness to refrain from future offending, Ms Khatri highlights concerns about impulsivity, a lack of stable accommodation, and episodic engagement with available support services.

Dr Thomas Renshaw, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was instructed on the application of the defence following submissions on 10 August 2025. His comprehensive report, submitted on 23 September, concluded that whilst no major psychiatric illness was evident, there were traits suggestive of mild borderline personality disorder alongside intermittent polysubstance misuse. Dr Renshaw emphasised that these factors, whilst relevant, did not negate culpability, nor did they necessitate inpatient treatment. He suggested referral to community mental health services as a priority.

The psychiatric perspective aligns with the view of the probation service that structured community interventions may offer a path towards desistance, provided adequate support and compliance.

It is pertinent to observe that the local authority housing department has acknowledged the difficulties faced by individuals in unstable tenancies and temporary accommodation, noting an upward trend in street homelessness and sofa-surfing since 2023. The Council’s Housing Liaison Officer, Ms Claire Donovan, provided written submissions on 28 September detailing the pressures on social housing provision. These broader societal factors form part of the background to the present case but cannot justify or excuse criminality.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

The court also received correspondence from Croydon Retailers’ Association, which, in a letter dated 2 October, outlined the cumulative effects of repeat shoplifting on small business viability. Their concerns centred on lost revenue, increased insurance premiums, and the resultant tightening of staffing and hours, which in some cases had led to premises closure.

The impact on shop floor staff was poignantly described: increased anxiety, the morale-sapping effect of repeated thefts, and a reluctance to confront offenders for fear of escalation. These realities underline the genuine harm occasioned by offences that are sometimes dismissed as ‘minor’ or ‘victimless.’

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

There is a familiarity to this case which the court cannot ignore: a defendant residing on the margins, juggling financial hardship, grappling with addiction and mental health challenges, yet repeatedly crossing the line into criminal conduct. The justice system continues to wrestle with how best to balance rehabilitation with public protection.

To this end, it is appropriate to recall the authority of R v. Blake [2023] EWCA Crim 980, where the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of sentencing reflecting the totality of offending, considering the offender’s personal circumstances, but underlining that neither severe hardship nor mental illness equates to immunity from punishment. The Court recognised that community sentences, suitably tailored, might provide the necessary structure to foster change.

You were afforded the opportunity to participate in voluntary diversionary schemes, which, according to the probation report, you declined or engaged with sporadically. It is a stark but unavoidable fact that public resources are finite, and the sustainability of such programmes depends on genuine participation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

Turning to the legal aid aspects of this case, the court must regretfully comment on the challenges experienced in securing timely funding authorisation for expert assessments. The application to instruct Dr Renshaw was initially submitted on 15 July but was subjected to repeated requests for clarification and administrative delays by the Legal Aid Agency, culminating only in approval on 30 August. Such delays impede the effective preparation of cases and place an undue burden upon both prosecution and defence. The court reiterates its calls for streamlined processes to support effective justice delivery.

The administrative burdens placed on the Probation Service cannot pass without mention. Staffing shortages, the impact of furlough schemes, and recent industrial action have conspired to delay the preparation of full assessments. Nevertheless, the diligent efforts of relevant staff in preparing reports under considerable pressure are acknowledged.

The court also notes that this matter has not involved any allegations or evidence of co-defendants, gang affiliation, or ancillary criminality such as assault or weapon possession. No related civil proceedings have been signposted, and the victim impact statements do not suggest personal harm beyond that inherent in theft offences.

In the wider scheme of things, Mr H, this case occupies a critical, if unglamorous, space within the criminal justice system. Low-level acquisitive crime is often dismissed as peripheral, but its insidious effects cumulatively strain communities, institutions, and public confidence. Your offending falls squarely within this problematology.

The law demands a response from this court that is proportionate, measured, and, critically, intended to advance the twin goals of public protection and rehabilitation. It behoves all parties to resist simplistic narratives, instead embracing a holistic appraisal of evidence, context, and individual circumstance.

Today’s proceeding was conducted in public in Courtroom 5 of Croydon Crown Court. The court thanks court staff for their efficient organising of the hearing, despite some temporary staffing shortages and last-minute interpreter adjustments. The court also extends appreciation to the usher and the court clerk who ensured proceedings were conducted with appropriate decorum.

The defendant’s letter to the court, submitted by counsel in advance, was noted for its articulate engagement with the facts and expression of remorse. While such representations do not carry evidential weight, they provide colour to the individual beyond the bare facts.

The court also encountered, during the course of the proceedings, a minor technical hiccup relating to audio recording equipment, which was swiftly resolved and did not disrupt the substantive conduct of the hearing.

Sentencing Framework and Considerations  
The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offenses emphasises the need to consider totality in sentencing, the culpability of the offender, the level of harm or loss, and any aggravating or mitigating factors.

Here, aggravating features include the persistent nature of offending, the targeting of vulnerable premises, and failure to engage meaningfully with intervention. Mitigating features include an absence of violence or threat thereof, your expressed remorse, and some degree of personal hardship.

The principle of totality requires that the sentence reflects the overall criminal behaviour. Custodial sentences should be reserved for cases where the offence or the offender’s history justifies deprivation of liberty as a last resort.

The court recognises that community orders supplemented with rehabilitation activity requirements can serve both punitive and constructive functions. The recent development and expansion of cognitive skills programmes designed to reduce acquisitive offending are particularly pertinent here.

In this vein, the probation report’s recommendation for further psychological intervention, substance misuse treatment, and housing support will weigh heavily in the court’s further consideration.

The court also acknowledges the jurisprudence from R v. Palmer [2022] EWCA Crim 1721, which supported the use of community sentences incorporating unpaid work and treatment programmes in cases involving repeat petty theft provided the risk to public safety is manageable.

Addressing the victim impact once more, the court notes the unchallenged evidence that store staff have incurred real distress and operational disruption. Their professionalism and forbearance are commendable but should not be relied upon to absorb manifest wrongdoings.

The pre-sentence report will, of course, inform the final decision, particularly concerning the suitability of various disposal options and the degree of supervision required.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1} through {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8} represent the substantive factual setting upon which this court’s orders will rest.

In conclusion, Mr H, these sentencing remarks set out the court’s current position: that your offending, whilst not rising to the gravest manifestations of acquisitive crime, nonetheless warrants a proportionate response involving structured oversight, rehabilitative engagement, and recognition of the harm caused.

I will adjourn sentencing to a date fixed for 21 November 2025, by which time the probation service is expected to produce a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing risk, needs, and suitable intervention pathways. Any further representations or updates should be submitted by parties before that date.

I record my thanks to all those who have contributed to the preparation of this matter: police officers, prosecutors, defence advocates, probation workers, mental health practitioners, and victims’ representatives.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Courtroom 5 at Croydon Crown Court. Proceedings have been digitally recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is hereby advised of the right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 39 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved to be determined at the sentencing hearing.

These are the orders of the court.
