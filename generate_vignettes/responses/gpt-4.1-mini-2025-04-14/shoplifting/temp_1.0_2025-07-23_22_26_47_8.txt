IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTWELL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/18427  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. E. FAIRBURN  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before the court to be sentenced for an offence of theft from retail premises under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically involving the appropriation of goods without payment from various commercial establishments. The conduct in question spans a period of approximately eighteen months, encompassing multiple incidents across Hartwell and neighbouring boroughs. This court has afforded the matter due consideration both in full awareness of statutory sentencing obligations and mindful of the wider context within which such offending arises.

Procedural History  
Your case came before this court following your arrest on 9 August 2025. The investigation precipitating your apprehension was precipitated by a concerted effort on the part of the Hartwell Retail Crime Partnership, the local Constabulary’s acquisitive crime unit, and cooperation from several affected businesses. The partnership, reflecting established multi-agency protocols, has sought to harness increasing co-ordination between police, council licensing departments, and retail security teams, with a view to stemming persistent low-level crime which has undercut community confidence over recent years.  
It is worth noting at this juncture that such cross-sector collaboration, while conceptually laudable, confronts persistent practical challenges. Variability in resource allocation across partners, turnover of personnel, and inconsistent compliance with information-sharing policies often compromise the timeliness and efficacy of response. These constraints have been highlighted in annual reviews conducted by the National Business Crime Coordination Centre, which, while detailing incremental improvements, also concede that progress remains patchy and uneven nationwide.

Your initial interview took place on 11 August 2025, conducted by Detective Constable Sarah Fenwick of the Hartwell Police Service, authorised under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. In that session, you exercised your right of silence but ultimately provided a prepared statement denying involvement in any theft. Following forensic analysis and review of CCTV footage, evidential certainty was achieved sufficient for charge on 26 August 2025. The single consolidated charge, elected for prosecutorial efficiency, encapsulates a course of conduct rather than isolated acts. This case was allocated according to the Crown Court tiering scheme and was listed first for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 10 September 2025.  
The Better Case Management regime (BCM), a staple of current Crown Court procedural frameworks, was duly applied to this matter with adherence to the indicative timetables outlined in the Criminal Practice Directions 2023. It is perhaps worth acknowledging, somewhat regrettably, that delays occasioned by legal aid authorisation for expert instruction proved unavoidable, introducing an intervening adjournment. This reflects a long-standing systemic issue now subject to ongoing consultation between judiciary bodies and the Ministry of Justice. The court hopes these discussions will yield improvements to prevent recurrence.

On the date fixed for plea, you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequently, and after a contested period during which the prosecution disclosed further digital evidence and witness statements, you submitted a guilty plea on 28 September 2025. Let it be noted that a plea at such a late stage engages reduced mitigating credit for admissions under established appellate precedents, including R v. Jones [2019] EWCA Crim 1123 and R v. Chapman [2021] EWCA Crim 574, recognizing the burden late pleas place on courts and victims alike.

The court thanks Ms Eleanor Birch, appearing for the Crown, and Mr Nicholas Wren, duty counsel for the defence under the Legal Aid scheme. It is with regret that I must reiterate the concerns expressed in multiple reports concerning the persistent difficulties faced by defence practitioners in securing timely funding approvals for forensic psychiatric evaluations. These bureaucratic impediments not only impair adherence to the criminal justice timetable but risk compromising the evidential thoroughness imposed by law. 

Legal and Sentencing Context  
The Theft Act 1968 remains the paramount statutory provision governing theft offences, codifying the essential elements and framing judicial discretion. The Sentencing Council guideline on Theft Offences (effective since 1 October 2019) instructs courts to evaluate offences by harm, culpability, and aggravating or mitigating features. Emphasis is placed on patterns of offending, the vulnerability of victims (real or perceived), and the impact on legitimate business operators.

Despite its seemingly archaic origins, case law continues to refine the parameters by which culpability is assessed. For instance, R v. Millward [2020] EWCA Crim 1789 articulated the principle that although low monetary value offences often attract community sentences, repeated conduct reflecting deliberate and opportunistic offending may warrant immediate custody. Similarly, the judgment in R v. Summers [2022] EWCA Crim 765, involving multiple counts of theft from charity shops, underscored the cumulative psychological effect on victims and the wider public’s sense of safety.

A note on sentencing credit for guilty pleas is essential. As the Court of Appeal expounded in R v. Harrison [2023] EWCA Crim 401, the discount rate fluctuates appreciably with timing and context. A plea entered at first reasonable opportunity may attract 25% credit, but those tendered mid-to-late proceedings typically receive far less. This court is mindful of balancing the incentives for early admissions with fairness given your circumstances.

Turning briefly aside, one cannot ignore that this court also routinely hears applications for the imposition of ancillary orders such as criminal behaviour orders or restraining orders in shoplifting cases. These are statutory tools commonly deployed to consolidate behavioural restrictions, but in the present matter, no such applications have been sought by the Crown or indicated by the defence. The court trusts that such matters will remain under review by statutory agencies should they become appropriate in future case management forums.

It may be instructive to recall, albeit tangentially, the appellate decision in R v. Dawes [2018] EWCA Crim 892—concerned with aggravated burglary committed under duress. It is entirely unrelated to your conduct, involving a distinctly different degree of violence and public harm. Inclusion of this reference serves solely to contextualise the principle that sentencing mirrors both the nature and gravity of offending, with robbery and violent crime continuing to occupy a markedly different part of the judicial spectrum than shoplifting.

The court also acknowledges the notable absence of press or public in today’s proceedings. Despite adherence to open justice principles, the phenomena of “courtroom invisibility” remain an ongoing challenge, as low-level theft cases do not typically engage widespread public attention or media reporting. This speaks, perhaps, to a public desensitisation to minor acquisitive offences or the overshadowing of such cases by more sensational matters.

Background and Mitigation  
The probation service report, compiled by Ms Tracy Warman, provides a comprehensive overview of your personal and social circumstances, obtained via interview and collateral liaison. You are currently 34 years of age, residing in council accommodation following a recent tenancy approval. The report notes your history of unstable employment and periods of unemployment extending over the past two years. You have no recorded gang affiliations or involvement in organised crime, but do acknowledge struggles with episodic alcohol misuse. Your previous convictions include three shoplifting offences, the latest of which resulted in a Community Order in 2021 and a conditional discharge in 2023, neither of which appear to have deterred recurrence.  
The probation officer emphasises your limited engagement with community support structures, despite referrals made by local authority welfare officers and outreach workers at the Hartwell Housing Aid Service. This limited uptake resonates with observations in Dr Simon Weller’s forensic psychiatric assessment, which evaluated you under instruction paid for by legal aid. Dr Weller’s detailed report concludes that you do not suffer a diagnosable mental illness that would substantially impair your criminal responsibility, though notes traits suggesting impulse control difficulties and a degree of emotional dysregulation, likely exacerbated by social isolation and transient housing insecurity.

It is prudent here to acknowledge the contributions of Dr Weller, whose thorough and balanced clinical opinion has greatly assisted this court’s understanding of your psychological profile. The report is measured and professionally prepared, reflecting the weight and complexity of the issues it addresses. His observations confirm that while treatment options may be warranted, they are unlikely in isolation to address the criminogenic drivers evident in your case.

That said, criminal justice social work continues to face immense strains with stretched staffing and increased caseloads that undermine the comprehensive delivery of rehabilitative interventions. The recent report by the National Probation Service underscores the mounting pressures and reduced capacity for tailored offender management. This court recognises these systemic limitations and the frustrations they occasion for all stakeholders.

There is also correspondence before the court from the West Hartwell Food Bank and Community Trust, submitted by Mrs Angela Meredith, who acts as coordinator. These letters describe your sporadic attendance and willingness to accept aid but express concern about your inconsistent engagement with ancillary services such as debt counselling and mental health referrals. Their stance is non-punitive but cautiously hopeful for more consistent progress if you adhere to a structured support plan.

The court also notes a letter of support from your younger brother, Mr Julian H, affirming your desire to “get things right” and emphasising recent efforts to seek stable employment. While familial bonds may provide some consolation, it is a matter for the court to determine what weight such subjective testimonials merit in light of the totality of evidence.

The Facts  
The particulars of your offending involve a series of thefts committed across multiple retail outlets, predominantly small convenience stores and independent pharmacies. Predatory targeting of popular consumables, notably over-the-counter medication and high-demand toiletry items, formed the modus operandi. CCTV footage confirms repeated visits aligned with peak staff absence or shift changes, enabling concealment of goods prior to egress without payment.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

Though no violence or threat thereof was employed, reports from store personnel denote escalating anxiety, some requesting reassignment due to fear of further contact. The psychological toll on these workers — primarily low-wage employees with limited support frameworks — cannot be overstated.

The Crown points out that despite prior youth diversion interventions and community-based sentences, the offending resumed within a period of months following completion of statutory orders, underscoring a regrettable pattern of non-compliance and recidivism.

There is, of course, a readily observed cumulative impact on both the commercial viability of affected stores and the confidence of local shoppers. Shrinking margins, increased security outlay, and insurance premium hikes translate into tangible economic detriment and community disquiet.

Sentencing Principles and Considerations  
Sentencing in cases of acquisitive offending requires a careful balance between the imperatives of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public and victims. The guideline affords particular emphasis to the seriousness of the offence by reference to the totality of harm—the scale and pattern of offending—and the offender’s criminal history and personal circumstances.  
While the offences herein are non-violent, the prospective demoralisation of vulnerable retail staff and erosion of communal trust warrant the court’s sober reflection.  
Custodial sentences remain a necessary option for repeat offences, particularly where previous dispositions have proven insufficient to engender desistance. However, the court is mindful of the limitations and potential disadvantages of immediate custody, especially where aggravating features such as violence or significant harm are absent.

It is vital to acknowledge the array of available community interventions. Structured activity requirements, cognitive behavioural programmes aimed at developing impulse control and moral reasoning, as well as debt advice and housing support schemes, hold the promise of reducing recidivism. These are best tailored following detailed assessments by probation, as we contemplate here.

At this point, I wish to reference, albeit briefly and without direct application, the case of R v. Kitson [2017] EWCA Crim 88, involving a defendant convicted of affray outside a licensed premises. While the violence inherent in such cases is markedly distinct from the non-violent theft offences under consideration, Kitson’s case clarifies principles relating to the assessment of personal culpability and the quantification of public interest in sentencing, underscoring the court’s role in reflecting community standards.

Furthermore, this court notes the ongoing professional discourse concerning the efficacy of multi-agency risk assessment conferences (MARAC) and multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) in managing offenders presenting complex risk profiles. Whilst your case does not currently engage those frameworks, the incremental workloads posed by these operational structures bear on wider system capacity.

In light of all the above, and prior to pronouncement of sentence, the court will seek a timely pre-sentence report to fully canvass your suitability for a rehabilitative community sentence in preference to immediate custody. The probation service is reminded to consider all viable interventions, including a possible Cognitive Skills Programme, attendance on a Thinking Skills course, and targeted support addressing substance misuse should it emerge as a contributory factor.

This court also urges assessment of any appropriate compensatory or restorative justice processes that might be acceptable to victims and offer potential for reparation.

Conclusion  
Mr H, you have been afforded every opportunity to admit responsibility at an earlier stage, but your admission of guilt came only after the prosecution had prepared to call witnesses and present the trial evidence. While that late plea is noted, the credit to be afforded is accordingly reduced. Your multiple previous convictions for
