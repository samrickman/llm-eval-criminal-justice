IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEICESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. L2025/04876  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. R. Thomlinson  
Filed: 19 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following a conviction relating to a series of shoplifting offences committed across several retail premises in Leicester city centre and adjoining suburban areas. The offences, as alleged and now admitted by your plea, fall to be considered under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, reflecting a pattern of dishonesty concentrated over a twelve-month period concluding in early 2025.

Procedural History and Context  
Your initial charge came on 13 March 2025, with an extended investigation led by Leicester City Police, drawing on collaboration with the Leicester Business Crime Partnership. This partnership, meant to target repeat offenders and organised retail theft groups, has, over recent years, endeavoured to coordinate intelligence across policing units, local councils, and business owners. It is important to acknowledge that such multi-agency efforts often experience significant obstacles including resource limitations, data-sharing constraints, and competing priorities, factors which this court considers in assessing the broader circumstances.

The Criminal Procedure Rules were engaged from the outset in this matter, with case progression overseen under the Better Case Management initiative, designed in theory to promote early identification of issues, timely disclosure, and prompt listing of hearings. Mr H’s case saw a number of procedural adjournments—some necessitated by defence requests for expert reports, others by the need to resolve legal aid authorisations.

The defence’s representative, Mr Philip Carrington, sought legal aid assistance to instruct a forensic psychologist with expertise in acquisitive offending, given concerns raised about your decision-making capacity and impulsivity. The application proved protracted, with initial refusals and requests for supplementary information causing delays of several weeks. I must record the court’s dissatisfaction with such bureaucratic hurdles, which impede the administration of justice and place avoidable strain on all parties. The Legal Aid Authority’s performance in this regard, once again, falls short of the efficiency demanded by the system.

Late pleas of guilty in cases of this nature have become a regrettable but frequent feature of the Crown Court’s workload. Your initial not guilty plea was tendered at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 22 April 2025, but was entered under final acceptance on 5 June 2025, shortly before the scheduled trial window. As established in the binding authority of R v. Middleton [2023] EWCA Crim 1524, credit for late pleas, particularly those entered after substantial case preparation and witness notification, must be significantly reduced from the maximum allowances typically afforded for early admissions. Such reductions reflect the additional burden imposed on victims, witnesses, and the court process itself. The dicta in Middleton emphasise that the exercise of judicial discretion regarding plea credit demands consideration of timing, genuineness of remorse, and impact on procedural economy.

I also take guidance from R v. Connolly [2021] EWCA Crim 1098, which examined the sentencing considerations for acquisitive offending demonstrating persistence and opportunism in low-level theft. There, the Court underscored that a degree of custodial deterrence may be justified despite modest monetary values involved, where offending is repetitive and shows little sign of desistment despite prior warnings and interventions.

It is worth noting that the Theft Act 1968 has remained substantively unchanged since its enactment, although its application has evolved in response to shifting patterns of acquisitive crime. Shoplifting, once widely perceived as an isolated and minor infraction, has now been recognised as a recurrent societal problem with complex causation factors including economic disadvantage, substance misuse, and mental health issues. While the criminal justice system is not a panacea for these challenges, it plays an indispensable role in delineating acceptable conduct and affording protection to victims—be they commercial entities or individual workers.

I pause to acknowledge the remarkable efforts of the Leicester Business Crime Partnership and affiliated retail staff who contributed witness statements and victim impact assessments. Despite often operating with limited resources, such bodies provide vital frontline engagement, enabling courts to understand the repercussions of repeated theft beyond immediate financial consequences—namely, the psychological toll on personnel, the disruption to service provision, and the knock-on effects on community confidence.

It is also proper to mention the invaluable work of local voluntary organisations such as Leicester Street Support and the Beacon Project, which offer assistance to vulnerable adults prone to involvement in acquisitive crime through substance misuse or socio-economic hardship. However, as with many such charitable bodies operating amid funding challenges and staff shortages, their reach is necessarily circumscribed and dependent on cooperation from those at risk, including defendants such as yourself.

Your case saw referral to the community forensic mental health team for evaluation. Dr Ruth Harding, consultant clinical psychologist, provided a comprehensive report dated 4 August 2025, which has been carefully considered. Dr Harding notes that while you do not meet criteria for a major psychiatric disorder, there is evidence of impaired impulse control, mild depressive symptoms, and situational anxiety likely exacerbated by housing instability and unemployment. The report further highlights an absence of engagement with existing support structures despite multiple offers of referral. The conclusion drawn emphasises the need for a structured, multi-modal intervention plan should you be afforded such an opportunity as part of any sentence.

While psychiatric and psychological reports can inform sentencing, as emphasised in R v. Rashid [2019] EWCA Crim 2241, the courts must ensure that the imperatives of public protection and deterrence are not overshadowed by therapeutic considerations alone. Rehabilitation and punishment are inextricably linked but remain distinct components of sentencing.

The court is conscious that recent years have witnessed legislative and policy developments impacting the handling of acquisitive offending. The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2017) remains the primary source of sentencing principles, with particular emphasis on harm, culpability, and mitigation. Furthermore, the judgement in R v. Parkinson [2018] EWCA Crim 2607, reiterates that offences causing psychological distress to retail staff constitute an aggravating factor, even where no physical violence occurs.

I also observe that the current court has undergone refurbishment restructuring this summer, improving facilities but unfortunately accompanied by some scheduling constraints due to temporary staff redeployment and altered court availability.

It is regrettable but true that national police forces continue to report increasing pressure on front-line officers to respond to “lower-tier” offences that nevertheless command disproportionate resource engagement, thus affecting responses to violent and organised crime. It is a reality that the courts and prosecutorial authorities cannot ignore.

As previously mentioned, the Legal Aid Agency’s repeated delays in responding to defence applications for expert assistance have been a cause of understandable frustration and inefficiency.

Turning to the background of the defendant, you are currently 34 years of age. Your conviction history includes three previous shoplifting offences with one community order imposed in 2021, which you failed to complete satisfactorily. You report a history of intermittent employment, predominantly casual and zero-hours contracts. Your accommodation circumstances have fluctuated, and you are presently housed in a supported lodging scheme run by East Midlands Housing Support.

Your letter to the court, submitted via Mr Carrington, was noted for its measured tone and acceptance of responsibility for the offences, albeit with reference to ongoing personal challenges including financial insecurity and fractured family relationships.

The facts of the case are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

Your offending was characterised by repeated entries into small-to-medium sized chain stores, frequently focusing on health and beauty products, snack items, and small electronics accessories. Surveillance footage shows you acting both alone and, on occasion, in the company of an unnamed associate, evidence against whom is not before the court today.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

On at least two occasions, you were observed deliberately removing security tags and using bags to conceal goods, a methodology indicating a degree of premeditation and sophistication beyond opportunistic theft.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4} {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

Security personnel reports included notes of your evasive behaviour and occasional verbal altercations when challenged, though no physical confrontations occurred. The cumulative effect of your actions caused a measurable increase in stress levels among affected staff, some of whom have expressed reluctance to return to their posts during certain shifts.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6} {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Despite multiple warnings and a community resolution previously issued, you persisted in this pattern of offending. That is a matter of serious concern to the court, indicating limited regard for the consequences of your behaviour.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

The court places some weight on the fact that you finally entered a guilty plea, albeit at a late stage in proceedings. This results in a reduction in sentencing credit consistent with established authorities.

I must stress to you that the court is not unsympathetic to the socioeconomic difficulties that often underlie acquisitive offending. Nonetheless, the decision to re-offend — whether motivated by necessity or impulse — brings with it accountability under the law. The principle that hardship does not mitigate dishonesty remains clear and established.

Turning to sentencing considerations, the court must balance the need for punishment, deterrence – both individual and general – rehabilitation, and protection of the public. The sentencer must also consider the totality principle in relation to any prior convictions and appropriateness of any custodial sentence in light of statutory guidance, notably the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences.

A custodial sentence remains a real possibility in this case given the persistence of offending, the failure of earlier interventions, and the impact on victims. Nevertheless, the report from probation and Dr Harding’s psychological assessment suggest that a structured community order could potentially facilitate engagement with services targeting impulsivity and lifestyle instability.

It should be stressed, however, that any such community order must be robust, enforceable, and closely supervised. Suspended sentences are likely to be unsuitable given your previous breaches of community orders.

I now turn to reference case law which, while not directly analogous, provide relevant sbject matter on sentencing principles in similar contexts. The case of R v. Bailey [2020] EWCA Crim 758, concerned a defendant convicted of repeated shoplifting from supermarkets involving a range of convenience goods with aggregate loss under £1,000. The Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence of 8 months partially suspended, emphasising recidivism and disregard for prior warnings as aggravating features.

In R v. Pringle [2019] EWCA Crim 356, a sentence of 10 months immediate custody was affirmed where repeated thefts involved coordination with accomplices and use of distraction techniques against staff. Though distinct from the present facts, Pringle illustrates judicial tolerance for community sentences diminishes markedly when offending shows persistence and culpability.

It should be noted that some offences, such as R v. Mahoney [2017] EWCA Crim 1023, concern more serious property crimes — e.g., burglary of residential dwellings at night — but these cases illustrate the principle that psychological harm inflicted on victims, even without physical violence, warrants substantial punitive measures.

The court has also reviewed relevant statutory updates concerning the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 which, while unrelated to this case, remain topical amidst recent public safety discourse. I mention this only to illustrate the breadth of matters with which the criminal courts must engage routinely.

I note also the case of R v. Forsyth [2021] EWCA Crim 1451, involving significant environmental harm through unlawful deposit of refuse, where custodial sentences were imposed despite absence of bodily injury, underscoring courts’ readiness to sentence firmly in regulatory offences.

Turning to sentencing frameworks, the Sentencing Council’s guideline sets out various aggravating and mitigating factors. Persistent offending, evident planning, and failure to heed warnings constitute clear aggravations. Conversely, expressions of remorse, attempts to make reparation, and demonstrable engagement with rehabilitative services warrant mitigation.

It is regrettable that your engagement with support services has been sporadic and inconsistent to date. The court appreciates the challenges faced by probation services, particularly amid staffing shortages and increasing caseloads. Many such services now utilise trauma-informed approaches designed to address underlying causes of acquisitive crime, as described in recent Home Office publications on offender management.

I note also that the National Health Service faces substantial demand pressures, meaning that access to mental health interventions for persons with complex needs often involves protracted waiting times. Such systemic factors lie beyond the control of all involved but are part of the context in which offending and rehabilitation occur.

Turning briefly to ancillary matters, the hearing benefited from the assistance of the court clerk, Mr Matthew Price, whose efficiency and courtesy are commendable. The court appreciates his efforts in managing the proceedings and ensuring appropriate record-keeping.

I also wish to make mention of pressing housing concerns in the Leicester area, where acute shortages of affordable and supported accommodation exacerbate vulnerability among populations at risk of offending. The East Midlands Housing Authority has recently published a report highlighting unprecedented demand for emergency placements, underscoring the systemic pressures contributing to patterns of acquisitive crime.

In determining sentence, I am mindful of the recent comments of the Court of Appeal in R v. Clemens [2024] EWCA Crim 231, emphasising that sentencing must remain pragmatic, grounded in realistic assessments of rehabilitation potential, and attuned to the real-world constraints faced by defendants.

The court regrets its inability to meaningfully engage with the defendant’s sister, Ms Louise Hamilton, or to receive additional statements from community organisations such as the Supporters for Change Trust due to time constraints and procedural deadlines. Such input can be invaluable in ensuring tailored interventions post-sentence.

I also record procedural delays occasioned by unforeseen absence of the probation officer assigned to the case, necessitating an adjournment scheduled on 4 August 2025, which was unavoidable but regrettable.

The court is now fully informed of the present circumstances, including your personal circumstances, offending history, and the impact on victims and community.

I shall therefore adjourn sentence for the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report directed at identifying the full range of sentencing options available, including the feasibility of community orders incorporating rehabilitative requirements such as accredited offending behaviour programmes, unpaid work, and mental health treatment stipulations.

In preparing this report, the probation officer is requested to provide a risk of harm assessment, an analysis of your motivational level concerning engagement, and consideration of available accommodation and financial support measures.

In the meantime, the court encourages you to take steps to engage proactively with available services and professionals to demonstrate genuine commitment to turning away from offending.

This is the sentencing hearing of 19 September 2025, conducted in open court at Leicester Crown Court, Court No. 4. The matters discussed have been recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, and this transcript is preserved for the official record.

You are hereby reminded of your right to appeal this sentencing decision within 28 days, pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

Reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 do not apply.

Costs are reserved pending final sentencing.

These are the orders of the court.
