IN THE CROWN COURT AT CHELSEA  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14327  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. F. Bartholomew  
Filed: 18 August 2025  

Mr H, you appear today for sentence before this court in respect of a charge of theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending in question pertains to a series of thefts from multiple retail establishments in the Kensington and Chelsea area, spanning a period of approximately fourteen months. The Crown contends that your actions comprise a clear pattern of deliberate and persistent dishonesty directed at businesses providing essential goods and services within the community.

Procedural History  
Following initial reports from local retailers identifying a pattern of repeated losses, a coordinated investigation was initiated by the Kensington Business Crime Reduction Unit in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police Service’s Borough Crime Team. The investigative phase encompassed a mixture of covert surveillance, confidential source intelligence gathering, analysis of multiple CCTV systems across borough StoreWatch schemes, and targeted interviews with witnesses and staff. This multi-faceted approach typifies the current paradigm of law enforcement where partnership working is essential given constrained operational resources. Such efforts represent not only considerable police time and expenditure but also require patient coordination among numerous agencies whose monthly workloads continue to expand without proportional augmentation in funding or personnel.

These investigations, however resource-intensive, play an indispensable role in upholding the integrity of the retail environment—particularly at a time when economic pressures on small businesses continue to escalate. The growing phenomenon colloquially referred to within police circles as “shrinkage” — the combined effect of theft, administrative error, and supplier fault — poses an ongoing challenge to sustainable retail operation and local employment. It is not uncommon for law enforcement teams to grapple with the competing demands of deploying assets to both high-profile violent crime and persistent low-level acquisitive offences, yet both categories attract legitimate public concern. As defined in R v. Shepherd [2019] EWCA Crim 1234, the prosecution of repetitive theft offences must balance considerations of proportionality with the evident cumulative detriment caused to victims.  

On 12 March 2025, you were apprehended by police officers following an incident at a high street pharmacy in Fulham. At that point, officers conducted a search resulting in the seizure of items later identified as stolen property. Your subsequent interview under caution was initially marked by a denial of involvement; however, further evidence — notably matching CCTV footage and exhibits recovered from your place of residence — undermined that position. Charges were formally preferred on 25 March and the case was listed for hearing at the Crown Court under the Better Case Management protocol.  

It is worth noting, notwithstanding, that this matter did not proceed without some delay. The court registry records demonstrate that adjournments were necessitated on occasions owing to defence Counsel’s applications for additional time to secure Legal Aid instructions and for the commissioning of an independent psychiatric assessment. Such procedural itineraries, while regrettable, are not uncommon in cases involving vulnerable defendants or where expert input is complex and time-consuming. The court is, however, mindful of the imperative to balance the accused’s rights to a fair and timely hearing with the systemic need to avoid undue prolongation of proceedings.  

Your initial plea at the plea and trial preparation hearing on 14 May was one of not guilty. Subsequent disclosure of further evidence — including witness statements from store personnel and more extensive forensic linkage — has since prompted you to enter a guilty plea on the morning of trial, on 1 August 2025.  

The court would remind all parties that the principles governing guilty plea discounts are well settled. As in R v. Bancroft [2020] EWCA Crim 1052, the timeliness of the plea is critical; earlier admissions permit more meaningful savings in court time and resource, as well as sparing witnesses the ordeal of attending trial. A late plea, entered only after the Crown’s case becomes irrefutable, attracts proportionately reduced credit. This approach was further reinforced in R v. Cromwell [2023] EWCA Crim 86, where the court highlighted that procedural gaming diminishes the weight of any plea mitigation.  

The court is aware of the broader context in which retail theft occurs, characterised by a gradual yet unmistakable escalation in frequency over recent years. This trend has coincided with socioeconomic challenges, including increased homelessness, food insecurity, and mental health difficulties among the urban populace. While some offenders may be drawn into offending due to acute deprivation or addiction, others may exploit systemic vulnerabilities or the reduced presence of security personnel in smaller shops. The proliferation of “no questions asked” return policies by some retailers also complicates the recovery of stock and positive deterrence.  

However, it must be underscored that such contextual factors do not exculpate criminal conduct. The rule of law dictates individual accountability, and this court cannot condone persistent breaches of public trust, nor the disruption caused to legitimate business activity, however modest the immediate monetary value.

Reference is made to the Local Government Act 1972 which established the framework for modern borough councils, including Kensington and Chelsea. This local authority has, over the years, developed partnership arrangements with law enforcement and business stakeholders designed to share information on repeat offenders and apply targeted interventions such as civil injunctions and community protection notices. The so-called Community Safety Partnerships thus convene regularly to address priority crime issues, including shoplifting hotspots identified through intelligence-led profiling. Despite these initiatives, challenges remain in adequately resourcing effective responses in light of competing demands such as anti-social behaviour, public nuisance, and violent crime.  

Within this framework, the Crown submits that your offending contributed to both direct financial loss and an atmosphere of unease amongst shop staff, some of whom have reported feeling anxious about lone working or subject to intimidation when approaching suspected offenders.

It is appropriate here to acknowledge the efforts of the Safer Streets initiative, which, since its inception in 2022, has sought to reduce acquisitive crime through environmental design improvements such as increased lighting, installation of facial recognition cameras, and increased patrols in known “hot spot” zones. The scheme’s evaluation reports indicate some success in reducing overall theft-related incidents, but also document displacement effects where offenders shift activity to less monitored precincts. The court notes the trial involved extensive use of digital evidence and analysis of behaviour patterns through data mining, reflecting the emergent role of technology in crime investigation.  

In assessing sentencing, this court proceeds under the guidance of the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Definitive Guideline (June 2018), which sets out factors including harm, culpability, and offender characteristics. The court has also considered caselaw such as R v. Greaves [2017] EWCA Crim 2155 that examines the gradations of harm and mitigating factors relevant to repeat theft cases.

It is noted that notwithstanding the apparently low immediate value of purportedly stolen items, the cumulative effect upon retailers can be substantial. Economic losses impact not only proprietary profit margins but also retailer willingness to employ front-line staff, invest in customer service, or maintain store viability, particularly in deprived areas.  

The strain on policing resource occasioned by serial shoplift offenders like yourself should also not be underestimated. When officers are assigned to low-value theft investigations, their diversion from other pressing duties impacts overall community safety and responsiveness. Furthermore, prolonged investigations yield considerable administrative overhead with collation of evidence, witness statements, and forensic analyses all contributing to increased burden.  

From the defence side, submissions were made emphasising your challenging social background, including a reported history of childhood neglect, intermittent homelessness, and struggles with substance dependence. Letters submitted by charity workers and social support organisations testify to periods of engagement with crisis accommodation and addiction counselling, albeit with limited sustained success. The court is conscious of the importance of recognising social determinants as part of a holistic assessment of offending behaviour. However, as the Court of Appeal observed in R v. Morton [2015] EWCA Crim 1033, personal circumstances, while relevant to mitigation, cannot outweigh the demands of public protection and the need for deterrence in repetitive acquisitive offending.

The recently completed psychiatric report by Dr Victoria Addison, consultant forensic psychiatrist, has been of considerable assistance to the court. Dr Addison’s report was thorough and professionally informed, detailing your mental health history, including episodes of depression and complex trauma, while concluding that no major psychotic disorder is present. The report identifies impulsivity and impaired judgement influenced by substance misuse as contributing factors. Dr Addison recommends community rehabilitation with close monitoring and integrated support for substance misuse, but cautions that untreated risk factors may lead to further offending. The report also addresses the relevance of your mental health status to culpability and sentencing, concluding that diminished responsibility is not applicable in these circumstances.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

The probation pre-sentence report further advises on your current housing instability and low levels of compliance with prior community orders, noting that your engagement with support services has been inconsistent and sometimes reactive rather than proactive. It suggests that rehabilitative efforts should include cognitive behavioural interventions addressing thinking and decision-making patterns, combined with financial management support and drug treatment programmes. The report stresses the need to balance rehabilitative aims with robust supervision to protect the public and reduce reoffending risk.  

The court acknowledges persistent challenges faced by the Probation Service in resourcing and supervising individuals with complex needs. Recent national audits have highlighted staff vacancies and turnover, resulting in increased case loads and diminished individualised attention. Despite these systemic issues, probation officers continue to demonstrate commendable commitment. Appreciation is also due to the staff of local charities such as the Chelsea Homelessness Project and the North Kensington Outreach Service, whose voluntary sector work provides critical front-line assistance to vulnerable individuals in pathways away from offending.  

As an aside, the court notes with concern the ongoing pressures faced by NHS mental health services, which have seen growing referral lists and protracted waiting times, particularly in community mental health teams serving high deprivation areas. The reach of crisis teams remains limited, and inpatient beds are scarce. These structural factors both exacerbate the challenges of effective support and must be factored into any realistic understanding of service user pathways.  

On a separate note, it is worth recording an earlier unsuccessful attempt by Legal Aid to authorise funding for an independent neuropsychological evaluation. Despite repeated submissions from defence Counsel, delays of up to six weeks were incurred while requests underwent multiple reviews and clarifications, underscoring systemic inefficiencies known to courts and practitioners alike. While ultimately resolved, such holdups add to the litigation burden and risk undermining procedural fairness through elongation of timetables.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

Turning now to sentencing considerations, the court reminds itself of the principles outlined in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline. The offending in this instance features persistent and premeditated dishonesty, exploitation of weaknesses in retail security, and repeated breaches of previous community-based disposals. While the value of stolen property may be modest per incident, the frequency and cumulative impact belie a significant level of culpability. The fact that staffing and operational adjustments were necessitated at targeted retail premises reflects broader community consequences beyond the immediate theft value.  

The recorded late guilty plea diminishes the mitigating credit to which you might otherwise be entitled. The court is mindful, however, of the indications of remorse expressed through counsel and the willingness to engage with rehabilitative services post-arrest. These are positive signs, albeit tempered by the history of similar interventions failing to prevent reoffending.  

The necessary balance must be struck between punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. Custodial sentences, while appropriate in some cases of acquisitive crime, are reserved for those where harm or culpability reach high thresholds, or where community orders have repeatedly failed. Given the present facts and available reports, the court is minded to consider community-based sentencing options incorporating structured supervision and behavioural intervention requirements. However, a custodial element cannot be excluded outright.  

It is therefore ordered that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be compiled forthwith by your probation officer. This report should address risk assessments, tailored therapeutic recommendations, potential engagement with substance misuse services, and feasibility of compliance with rehabilitation activity requirements or unpaid work. It should also consider any safeguarding concerns, including the potential impact of housing instability on your offending risk.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Chelsea. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal sentencing hearing will take place upon receipt of the pre-sentence report and any additional representations. You are advised of your right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged on this matter pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
