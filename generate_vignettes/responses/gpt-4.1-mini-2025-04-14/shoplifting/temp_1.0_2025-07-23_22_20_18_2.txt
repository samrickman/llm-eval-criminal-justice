IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/14820  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. C. LANGLEY  
Filed: 14 August 2026  

Mr H, you appear today before this court for sentence following your conviction on charges brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to theft by shoplifting. These offences spanned a period extending from late 2024 through the first quarter of 2026 and primarily involved retail premises located within the Greater Manchester metropolitan area. The prosecution case, for which you now stand convicted, involved a pattern of sustained dishonest conduct characterised by repeated thefts from multiple outlets.

Procedural Background  
Your matters came before this court following a thorough investigative process initiated by officers of the Greater Manchester Police, in liaison with the City Retail Crime Taskforce and various local business security teams. The investigation was prompted by a discernible pattern of incidents around Binford and Cherrybrook shopping precincts, where discrete episodes of shoplifting—initially considered isolated—were collated into a coherent series after detailed review of CCTV materials, staff reports, and loss prevention records.

In the course of proceedings, you were initially bailed on strict conditions and subjected to electronic curfew measures pending trial. There were several procedural engagements, including an initial hearing on 3 February 2026 and a plea and trial preparation hearing listed for 17 March 2026, at which time you maintained a not guilty plea. Following further disclosure, including forensic linkage of footwear recovered at your residence with prints visible on security footage, you altered your plea to guilty just days before trial commences.

It is necessary here to remark briefly on the evolving landscape into which this case falls. The Better Case Management (BCM) protocol adopted across Crown Courts has, over the past decade, sought to streamline proceedings, particularly in offences that might otherwise be overwhelmed by voluminous and often repetitive disclosure. The litigation history of this case reflects a largely harmonious engagement with BCM expectations, notwithstanding some delay attributable to Legal Aid Agency procedural requisites regarding funding for expert assessments. The delays occasioned by these administrative obstacles — while regrettable — are not sufficiently egregious to impugn the integrity of the judicial process in this instance.

Before turning to the substantive consideration of sentencing, I wish to place on record my thanks to the prosecution team, led by Ms Nicola Trent, and to Mr Graham Parsons for his conscientious representation of the defendant pursuant to a Legal Aid certification. Their professionalism is acknowledged. I also extend appreciation to the court staff, including the recently appointed court usher, Mr Dev Patel, whose efforts in managing case flow have been noted in sessions prior. The recent refurbishment of Courtroom 5, notwithstanding some initial acoustic difficulties, has marginally improved the working environment for all concerned.  

Turning now to the broader context, it is necessary to note that acquisitive crime of the type under consideration here carries consequences beyond the immediate financial loss. The wider community impact—on commerce, on staff wellbeing, and on public confidence—is a matter to which this court is deeply attuned. As I have observed in previous remarks concerning offences against retail premises, the psychological effect on employees, the disruption to business operations, and the potential for cumulative harm render even seemingly minor thefts a subject of substantial concern.

Legal Context  
In explicating the legal framework applicable here, reference must first be made to the Theft Act 1968, under which dishonesty coupled with appropriation and an intention to permanently deprive constitutes the offence of theft. Though shoplifting may, in many instances, be dealt with summarily or via alternative resolutions, the protracted and repetitive nature of your conduct warranted escalation to Crown Court adjudication.

Sentencing decisions in such matters draw upon both the Sentencing Council guideline for theft and related offences and the broader principles enunciated in case law—particularly the imperative to balance punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation. It is well recognised that repeat offending, especially when coupled with evident planning or subterfuge, attracts higher tariff sentences, reflecting the cause of public protection and the need to mark societal disapproval.

Precedent is instructive in framing the sentencing range. In R v. Sunderland [2019] EWCA Crim 1205, the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence where the pattern of theft spanned multiple occasions from a community supermarket, with aggravating circumstances including disregard for prior warnings and vulnerable victims. Similarly, R v. Chandler [2022] EWCA Crim 557 involved thefts targeting a charity outlet, with judgment affirming that the sustained betrayal of public goodwill severely aggravates the gravity.

Relevant case law also cautions against over-crediting late pleas. As noted in R v. McManus [2021] EWCA Crim 1980, a plea entered only hours before trial — akin to the present situation — attracts significantly reduced mitigation for guilty plea, given the limited procedural economy afforded to the court and witnesses.

Supplementing these principles, the Sentencing Council guideline emphasises taking proper account of both culpability factors and harm. The targeting of stores providing social value, such as pharmacies or low-income access retailers, may aggravate. Equally, the manner of offending—concealment, removal of security devices, repeated breaches of community resolutions—must be factored into assessment.

It is noteworthy that the court’s attention has been drawn to the potential application of ancillary orders in theft cases, such as compensation and confiscation proceedings, and the availability of unpaid work or rehabilitation activity requirements where community sentences are found appropriate. The final sentence will be informed by the pre-sentence report in this regard.

Societal Context and Institutional Observations  
Before addressing the particulars of your conduct, I feel compelled to record some reflections on the current challenges facing the justice system and public services more broadly. The courts operate within a network of stretched institutions, from law enforcement through probation and social support, each grappling with unprecedented demand and limited resources. Policing of non-violent acquisitive offences has in recent years become a balancing act: diverting skilled investigative staff towards crimes of higher harm while endeavouring to provide proportionate responses to shoplifting, which remains by volume one of the most frequent reported offences nationally.

In this regard, engagement with the Business Crime Reduction Partnership across Manchester has been variable. While the partnership’s intentions to coordinate rapid response and intelligence sharing are laudable, they are often frustrated by fluctuating personnel and resource constraints. This case is an example where, thanks to effective on-the-ground cooperation between store managers and local police, a comprehensive evidential base was eventually assembled. Equally, there remains the persistent problem of underreporting of such thefts. Many retail establishments elect not to report minor loss, especially where prior experiences suggest that outcomes will be protracted or unsatisfactory. This reluctance undermines crime statistics and hampers public safety strategies.

The interface between the criminal justice system and voluntary and charitable sectors also merits comment. Local organisations such as the Manchester Retail Workers Advocacy Group have reported adverse effects on employees’ mental health and job retention, issues that, while secondary to criminal adjudication, provide necessary context. Similarly, this court acknowledges the challenges facing the Legal Aid Agency, where procedural bottlenecks and funding delays continue to negatively impact timely access to justice. The present case encountered minor delays in approving expert psychiatric evaluations, underscoring systemic weaknesses that remain unresolved despite repeated calls for reform.

Psychiatric and Probation Reports  
A psychiatric report prepared by Dr Helena Voss, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was commissioned to assess your mental health and capacity. Her detailed assessment concludes that, whilst you do not suffer from a major mental illness, you exhibit traits consistent with emotional dysregulation, features of attention deficit disorder, and mild substance misuse history not rising to dependence. Dr Voss noted a degree of impoverished social support and marginal housing instability, compounded by sporadic engagement with services.

The report emphasises that there is no evident risk of harm to others directly emanating from any mental health condition. However, it draws attention to impulsivity and situational stressors as contributory to your offending behaviour, concluding that focused therapeutic interventions targeting coping skills and emotional regulation may offer benefit.

The probation officer’s pre-sentence memorandum, circulated to the court and parties, echoes these observations. The risk of serious harm to the public is assessed as low; risk of reoffending as medium given your history. The plan advocates for inclusion in a thinking skills programme and consideration of a rehabilitation activity requirement, with scrutiny of housing stability and substance misuse referrals. The officer recognises your expressed willingness to engage with support but notes previous inconsistent attendance at voluntary programmes.

I have also reviewed prior court records indicating your history includes four previous convictions for shoplifting and two community resolution disposals. None resulted in custodial sentences, though there were instances of breach of imposed curfews.

The facts, as they emerge, reveal a pattern of deliberate and calculated dishonesty. Surveillance and store staff testimonies demonstrate your familiarity with the premises and routines, evident use of concealment tactics, and a deliberate avoidance of detection. The court notes in particular the repeated targeting of certain product categories as valued commodities in secondary markets.

No violence or threats of violence were attributable to you, yet the psychological pressure exerted on shop personnel—particularly younger employees and those working alone—cannot be underestimated. Reported anxieties resulted in modified shifts and increased security measures, including the installation of additional CCTV and the presence of loss prevention guards, all imposing cost burdens on business owners.

It is further noted that previous community resolutions and warnings appeared insufficient to deter your continued offending, reflecting a degree of disregard for formal processes and community expectations.

The prosecution highlighted at trial the cumulative loss amounting to several thousand pounds, spread over numerous individual thefts, supporting an inference of sustained intention.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

Case law reminds us that when an offender demonstrates repeated breaches of the peace, coupled with disregard for earlier warnings or penalties, the court is entitled to impose sentences that reflect the aggravating impact of such persistence. R v. Ellery [2020] EWCA Crim 961 emphasised that custodial sentences are often appropriate where multiple offences represent a course of conduct undermining public confidence in law enforcement and retail security.

Discussion of Aggravating and Mitigating Factors  
In determining the appropriate sentence, the court must balance all relevant factors. Aggravating features here include the sustained duration of offending, the repeated nature of the conduct despite warnings, the impact on vulnerable retail employees, and the economic harm to multiple small businesses.

Mitigation is limited by the late admission of guilt, only entered shortly before trial, which diminishes entitlement to a full reduction for plea. On the other hand, your lack of violent behaviour, the absence of significant prior custodial sentences, and the findings of expert reports indicating potential benefit from community-based interventions weigh in favour of non-custodial considerations.

The wider social context of housing instability and financial difficulty—while providing some explanation—must not be overstated as justification. The court acknowledges the increased pressures on vulnerable individuals in urban environments, including the effects of economic marginalisation. Yet these realities cannot displace personal responsibility.

The sentencing framework outlined in the Theft Offences guideline directs attention to the need for rehabilitation activity combined with adequate punishment and deterrence. Public protection must be assured, though the indicated low risk of serious harm militates against immediate custodial imposition if viable alternatives exist.

The Role of Victim Impact Statements and Community Responses  
Victim impact statements collected from retail management corroborate the distress, economic loss, and operational disruption caused by your offending. Some staff members reported experiencing increased stress and even symptoms of anxiety triggered by your repeated presence.

Correspondence from local business associations highlights concerns about the cumulative effect of retail crime on property viability, employment, and community cohesion. These concerns underline the broader societal harm generated by sustained theft-causing economic and psychological damage not readily quantifiable in monetary terms.

At this juncture, I also wish to record appreciation for those working behind the scenes to support victims of retail crime, from local policing units to charitable organisations such as the Greater Manchester Retail Staff Welfare Trust. Their enduring efforts to assist affected individuals, provide counselling, and advocate for enhanced workplace protections deserve recognition.

I note briefly that this court has been supplied with ancillary letters of support from family members and community mentors, who describe your efforts to improve your circumstances, though these are tempered by candid admissions of continuing difficulties.

The Influence of Legal Aid and Expert Input  
The delays occasioned by applications for psychiatric evaluation funding through the Legal Aid Agency, while unfortunate, did not ultimately compromise your right to a fair hearing. However, these systemic delays add to the broader justice system burden and risk diminishing defendants’ confidence in procedural fairness.

Similarly, the involvement of the City's Forensic Data Unit to conduct analyses of CCTV footage represents the increasing intersection of technology and policing in acquisitive crime investigations. The unit’s skilled work was vital in confirming identity and patterns, though such specialised resources remain costly and limited in availability.

I must mention one tangential matter that arose in procedural discussions: a co-defendant in an associated but distinct matter was found with an offensive weapon unrelated to your own conduct. Such peripheral issues, while documented in the wider case file for completeness, bear no relevance to your culpability or risk assessment and have not influenced these sentencing remarks.

In another adjunct matter, an unrelated co-defendant was charged with affray involving a pool cue during an unrelated public house incident. Again, these facts, while recorded, have no bearing upon your case, which concerns strictly non-violent theft.

Summary and Next Steps  
Having regard to all the above, it is apparent that the offending is serious by virtue of frequency, persistence, and cumulative harm. It shows a disregard for law, community norms, and previous interventions. At the same time, there remain grounds to consider structured community sanction that involves rehabilitative elements targeted at impulsivity, financial management, and social stability.

This court will, therefore, adjourn sentencing to permit receipt of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, which will incorporate assessments on suitability for community orders including unpaid work, rehabilitation activity requirements, potential drug and alcohol testing, and mental health interventions. The report will also evaluate risk to the public and compliance likelihood.

In doing so, I emphasise that the precise sentence will be informed by this forthcoming report and full consideration of your circumstances. Custody remains a potential outcome but community alternatives will be explored carefully in view of expert advice.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 August 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. Proceedings have been transcribed fully pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal record of conviction will be recorded accordingly. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved for determination.

These are the orders of the court.
