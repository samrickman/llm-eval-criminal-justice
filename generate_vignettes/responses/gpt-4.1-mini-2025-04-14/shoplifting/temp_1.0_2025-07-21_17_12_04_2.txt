IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/14893  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. Fitzgerald  
Filed: 15 August 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing on a charge of shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, prosecuted on a representative count, spans a period beginning in early 2023 through to the spring of this year. Your offending principally engaged multiple retail outlets situated within the Greater Manchester area, including both high street and suburbia-based premises. The charge before me is the subject of a Crown Court indictment issued following committal from the magistrates and prominent in a case management process under the aegis of the Better Case Management (BCM) arrangements introduced some years ago to enhance the efficiency of serious and complex case disposal.

To place the matter in procedural context, it is necessary to record that your initial bail condition was set on 10 March 2025 pending the finalisation of evidence collation. The police investigation, coordinated by the Greater Manchester Business Crime Unit, invoked the enhanced tools permitted by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, including the use of directed surveillance and data analysis of public transport use. The investigative period involved liaison with multiple retailers' loss prevention teams, community safety partnerships, and local authority regulatory officers tasked with environmental protection and small business support.

It is apt to observe the evolving operational environment in which such crime is investigated and prosecuted. Retail crime has increasingly demanded sophisticated cross-sector cooperation that goes beyond the traditional remit of local policing. Partnerships between merchants, law enforcement, and community organisations remain vital yet often rely heavily on voluntary data sharing and the discretion of proprietors. The process by which this evidence is collated, authenticated, and presented is neither straightforward nor timely. The impact of under-resourcing these efforts cannot be overestimated. It is worth noting that delay in this case was occasioned not only through the anticipated challenges of managing extensive digital disclosure but also as a consequence of judicial strike action affecting court listing availability during the late spring months.

The prosecutor representing the Crown today, Ms Olivia Thompson, has provided a thorough outline of your admitted conduct and the evidence led against you. Your counsel, Mr James Ellison, appearing pursuant to a Legal Aid order, has submitted detailed mitigation and emphasised your personal circumstances, including housing instability and mental health concerns. It is regrettably necessary to record that the processing of your Legal Aid application was protracted due to resource constraints and procedural ambiguities within the Agency, resulting in delay to the commissioning of a psychiatric evaluation originally sought in January 2025.

At the plea and trial preparation hearing held 12 June 2025 in this court, you entered a not guilty plea initially, thereby necessitating the preparation of evidential disclosures and witness statements. However, on 30 July 2025, shortly before the trial was set to commence, you changed your plea to guilty, following receipt of additional forensic and surveillance evidence compiled by the prosecution. This pattern of late plea has become ubiquitous in acquisitive crime cases and is routinely addressed by the appellate courts. It is well settled that the timing of a plea can significantly impact the extent of credit for remorse and early acceptance of responsibility.

Turning to relevant authority, the principles laid down in R v. Hartley [2020] EWCA Crim 1234 remain illustrative. In that case, the appellant was convicted of a series of thefts from retail establishments and received a sentence reflecting the cumulative nature of his offending despite relatively modest individual loss values. The Court of Appeal reiterated the necessity of proportionality in sentencing but emphasised the importance of deterrence, particularly where there had been persistence in offending despite prior cautions. While the facts differ, the sentencing framework is applicable here.

Additionally, I note the observations in R v. Barnes [2018] EWCA Crim 987 concerning the imposition of community orders for shoplifting where the defendant demonstrated genuine engagement with rehabilitative services. In Barnes, the Court stressed that community-based sentences might be appropriate in the absence of aggravating features, particularly if the offender shows willingness to cooperate and attend intervention programmes. The present case, while dissimilar in some respects, invites consideration of such options.

I must also draw attention to judicial experience with cases involving significant procedural delay attributable to administrative factors outside the control of prosecuting or defence parties. The recent judgments in R v. Sanderson [2023] EWCA Crim 765 reminded courts to consider such extrinsic factors cautiously but to keep the overriding objective of justice firmly in view.

It is relevant, though peripheral to this hearing, to mention the ongoing challenges faced by the Legal Aid Agency, whose operational difficulties and backlog in authorising expert reports have been the subject of increasing scrutiny in recent parliamentary debates and judicial commentary. These systemic issues have tangible impacts on case progression, as demonstrated here.

I further acknowledge the contribution of the Manchester Retailers' Association, whose detailed victim impact statements — carefully distilled from numerous staff reports — illuminate the cumulative emotional and psychological sequelae of persistent theft on employees, many of whom are in low-paid roles with limited job security. Such insights are invaluable to the court’s assessment of harm.

In addition, I have considered a recent memorandum from the Regional Probation Service dated 3 August 2025, which flags the service’s present strain due to rising caseloads stemming from a surge in non-serious acquisitive offences. The memo highlights that delays in court timetabling due to venue refurbishment and staffing shortages have hampered effective supervision and intervention. It is a regrettable backdrop to the individual case before me.

Your personal circumstances have been extensively reported upon in the psychiatric evaluation obtained through the efforts of your defence team, notably Dr Miriam Lockett’s comprehensive report dated 20 July 2025. She describes your mental health profile as indicative of mild depressive symptoms with associated tendencies to social withdrawal and diminished impulse control. However, Dr Lockett explicitly cautions against attributing your offending entirely to an underlying mental disorder, noting a lack of psychotic features or significant mood instability. She points to environmental stressors, such as ongoing housing instability and social isolation, as key contributory factors. The report makes measured recommendations for community supervision entwined with therapeutic input.

Mr H, the facts of your offending, as fully detailed in the prosecution evidence and the submissions of your counsel, reveal a deliberate pattern of theft undertaken over a sustained timeframe. Each incident involved concealment of goods, usually at times when staff vigilance was diminished, employing methods ranging from distraction to the use of bags or clothing to obscure items.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

The offences were not opportunistic but reflected a modus operandi honed over time, targeting stores with limited security provision and attempting to circumvent detection through repeated visits and apparent familiarity with the environment.

In drawing comparisons, the Court must consider R v. Colson [2021] EWCA Crim 2145, wherein the defendant engaged in the theft of multiple electronics from a retail mall. The Court recognised the complex impact on victims, acknowledging that while individual items were low in value, the aggregate effect, particularly on retail confidence and employee morale, was significant.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

The persistence exhibited raises concerns about the sufficiency of prior community-based interventions. Despite previous cautionary actions and discussions with local police diversion officers, your continued offending calls into question the efficacy of such measures absent robust supervision and tailored rehabilitation.

Further, victim statements chronicle the psychological toll on staff, including anxiety and occupational stress leading to altered working patterns and diminished job satisfaction.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

It is also germane to remark upon the wider societal context in which this case unfolds. Rising homelessness rates, the proliferation of food insecurity, and constraints on statutory support services compound the challenges individuals like yourself face. Yet these systemic factors, while not disregarded, cannot displace personal accountability.

One might pause to consider analogous circumstances described in R v. Dawson [2019] EWCA Crim 376, which involved shoplifting amid documented substance misuse. There, the Court acknowledged the interplay of addiction and acquisitive offending but underlined the necessity of proportionate sentencing aimed at both punishment and rehabilitation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Your defence submissions recount a history of fragmented family support and transience, which no doubt contribute to the vulnerabilities you contend with.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

The Crown correctly emphasises that your offending caused measurable harm, disrupted local businesses, and imposed unnecessary burdens upon both police resources and retail staff, who often work under difficult conditions with limited institutional backing.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

Turning to aspects extraneous to your personal conduct but relevant in profiling the broader operational environment, the court notes a recent unrelated case: R v. Foster [2024] EWCA Crim 1122, which concerned a repeat offender convicted of arson in a nearby jurisdiction. Though wholly unconnected to your circumstances, the case exemplifies the complexities faced in balancing public protection, offender rehabilitation, and efficient justice administration in the 21st century.

Moreover, it is instructive to recall the precedent in R v. Grant [2021] EWCA Crim 900, which dealt with a community-based assault at a licensed premises. Mr Grant’s sentence was adjusted upwards due to the impact on vulnerable patrons. While dissimilar in offence type, this case reflects judicial attitudes toward the need for deterrence even in low-level crime, especially when public confidence is at stake.

As a note of procedural interest, it came to the court’s attention that the co-defendant in an entirely separate matter appearing later this week — accused of trafficking Class B drugs — was remanded following evidence of witness intimidation. This fact, unrelated to your case, nevertheless serves as a backdrop to the broader criminal justice challenges in managing overlapping case loads.

Your defence submissions also referenced a recent report commissioned by the City Council on the efficacy of anti-shoplifting devices in local stores. While peripheral to this matter, such documents serve to underscore the ongoing efforts of retailers and local authorities to mitigate acquisitive crime within constrained budgets.

Similarly, correspondence from one of your neighbours was submitted, describing neighbourhood disturbances unrelated to your conduct but indicative of community tension and varied social issues in your residential area.

One should not overlook the challenges faced by probation officers working in similar cases. A letter from Ms. Helen Greenwood, a senior officer in the Local Probation Service, dated 2 August 2025, outlines considerable pressures including caseload increases, staff vacancies, and delays in service provision caused by wider NHS waiting list backlogs for mental health treatment.

Returning to your case, the court will give full weight to the expert psychiatric opinion, the presented victim impact material, and your personal circumstances.

In line with Sentencing Council guidelines, the aggravating factors include persistence, planning, and the impact on local businesses and employees. Mitigating elements revolve around your early engagement post-plea, mental health profile, and the absence of violence or threats.

The court is mindful of the importance of proportionality and the broader public interest in rehabilitation. The potential availability of community-based sentences incorporating behavioural programmes, financial management advice, and mental health support will be explored through a pre-sentence report.

Sentencing has been adjourned pending receipt of this report, which will be prepared with an emphasis on assessing your suitability for intervention aimed at reducing reoffending and promoting reintegration.

I record my thanks to Ms Olivia Thompson, counsel for the Crown, and to Mr James Ellison, counsel for the defence, for their thorough and professional submissions. I also note, again with regret, the regrettable delay occasioned by the operation of bureaucratic processes within the Legal Aid Agency, which have impeded the earlier commissioning of expert psychiatric assessments.

The hearing today was conducted in open court, attended by all legal parties. The court notes with due respect the public interest in ensuring that those who offend against community trust, even repeatedly at a low level, receive fair but firm justice.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 August 2025, in Court 4 at Manchester Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal sentencing hearing will follow upon receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further representations. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, within 28 days of sentence. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved at this stage.

These are the orders of the court.
