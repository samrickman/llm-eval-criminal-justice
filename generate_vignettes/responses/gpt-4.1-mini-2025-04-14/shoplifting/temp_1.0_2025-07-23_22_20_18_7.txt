IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/08054  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. S. Haythorne  
Filed: 30 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court charged with a representative count of theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, reflecting a long-standing sequence of offences encompassing shoplifting from various commercial outlets across the Greater Manchester area from late 2023 through to mid-2025.

Procedural History  
Your arrest was effected on 12 July 2025, following a prolonged inquiry led by Greater Manchester Police’s Retail Crime Unit, augmented by the active involvement of the Manchester Business Crime Prevention Partnership. This investigative collaboration was instituted in response to a discernible spike in petty theft reports impacting several independent and chain retailers within the city centre and adjoining districts. Initial reports of isolated thefts—often dismissed or classified as minor—escalated upon cross-institutional collation of security footage, witness statements, and stock irregularities, revealing a consistent pattern attributable to your conduct.  

This situation epitomises challenges endemic to managing retail crime today. The expectation placed upon law enforcement to devote significant personnel time and forensic resources to offences frequently involving items of relatively low monetary value places undue strain on already overstretched services. The investigation supporting your prosecution demanded exhaustive digitised evidence review, reconciliation of divergent records from multiple premises, and the identification of temporal and behavioural consistencies. Such endeavours consume resources that, though essential to the administration of justice, inevitably detract from the capacity to address more serious or violent crime. Additionally, the Business Crime Prevention Partnership framework, while conceptually robust, often falters in practice due to variance in inter-agency communication protocols, fluctuating leadership continuity, and inadvertent administrative lapses. Despite these systemic limitations, the investigative team diligently advanced this matter to charge.  

Following arrest, you were interviewed under caution but initially denied involvement. Detailed forensic examination of electronic purchase histories, as well as forensic analysis of clothing and bag fibres, linked you directly to multiple incidents. Charges were accordingly preferred on 21 July 2025, consolidating numerous counts for judicial efficiency. The matter was transferred promptly to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management initiative, with hearings scheduled in accordance with established timelines.  

Notwithstanding expectations, this case has experienced several adjournments, notably owing to delays surrounding Legal Aid authorisation for expert reports and an application for additional documentary evidence from the defence. Such prolongation, while regrettable, underscores procedural complexities inherent in cases touching upon psychological and social vulnerability. I must emphasise the critical necessity of balancing expedient justice with comprehensive assessment to uphold fairness—a task complicated further by resource constraints and staff shortages across both Legal Aid administration and probationary services.  

Prior to this sentencing hearing, a psychiatric evaluation was facilitated through the instigation of Mr Fuller, a consultant forensic psychologist working under commission by defence counsel. The report provides in-depth insight into your mental health status and attendant risks, supplementing the probation service’s pre-sentence report, which was received with diligence despite ongoing challenges emanating from staff attrition and increasing caseload volumes in the local Probation Trust.  

I wish here to acknowledge the continued professional contributions of both Mr Tom Fuller and Probation Officer Rebecca Mallory, whose detailed assessments have been crucial in shaping the court’s understanding of the multifaceted circumstances that attend the offences before me. It would be remiss not to note the systemic pressures bearing upon these services, including rising demand for support from vulnerable adults contending simultaneously with homelessness, substance dependency, and complex mental health needs. Such intersecting challenges inevitably complicate efforts at rehabilitation and public protection alike.  

There is a broader social context worthy of mention. Manchester, like many large urban conurbations, is contending with an upturn in street homelessness, frequently accompanied by visible distress and antisocial behaviour. The economic downturn and enduring fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated resource scarcity in statutory and voluntary sectors. Organisations such as the Manchester Outreach Initiative—a voluntary sector programme providing shelter and psychosocial support—have struggled to maintain continuity. The court recognises and commends these services’ unwavering commitment amid such adversity.  

Responsibility for procedural progression cannot be wholly attributed to institutional inertia. Defendants, counsel, and families all have roles to play. In this case, counsel for the defence, Mr L. Gibbs, has engaged constructively, submitting both formal representations and supportive character references from the Hope Haven Charity and Mr H’s estranged mother. These letters were considerate, though naturally emphasised mitigating circumstances and did not dispute the factual matrix underpinning the Crown’s case.  

The Crown Prosecution Service has ably been represented throughout by Ms K. Atkins. I formally record my appreciation of her clear and measured submissions and the evident professionalism with which she has managed this engagement. Likewise, I acknowledge the work of policing officers within the Winnington Retail Unit and the local Safer Neighbourhoods Team, whose operational involvement has been complex and time-consuming.  

Despite various adjournments necessitated by legal aid application complications, including repeated requests for clarifications by the Good Hope Legal Aid Office, the defence has now presented all relevant mitigation and expert evidence. The court regrets the administrative delays inherent to the Legal Aid Agency’s procedures, which remain a source of considerable concern nationally. Such delays not only impede case resolution timeliness but may also have a lasting negative impact on defendants’ prospects for engagement with supportive provision.  

This hearing has been conducted in open court, pursuant to normal preparatory and procedural requirements. The courtroom, recently refurbished with the installation of audio-visual equipment, remains under capacity for civilian observers, and notably, attendance by media representatives remains limited. This circumstance reflects a wider malaise concerning public visibility and community engagement in matters of acquisitive crime, frequently perceived as of diminished public interest compared to more violent or headline-making offences. However, the human consequences of offences such as these are tangible and significant. The court remains mindful of this reality.  

Legal Context  
The principal charge is brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The legislative framework has been developed over several decades, with landmark amendments and jurisprudential refinements informing the present sentencing landscape. It is the dishonesty element, combined with the intention to permanently deprive, that forms the basis of this offence. The statutory guidance promulgated by the Sentencing Council in 2024 confirms the critical importance of evaluating the cumulative harm caused by repeated offending alongside the individual circumstances of the defendant.  

Historical case law remains a rich resource in assisting courts in their sentencing deliberations. For example, in R v. Fallsworth [2017] EWCA Crim 335, an aggravated burglary case, the Court reaffirmed the principle that while the value of stolen goods is a relevant consideration, the psychological impact on victims can aggregate to justify a custodial sentence. Although the factual content of Fallsworth is not directly analogous here, the underlining sentencing philosophy retains pertinence.  

Similarly, R v. Cornwell [2019] EWCA Crim 1872, concerned with aggravated vehicle theft, underscores that repeated offences extracting even modest economic value cannot be overlooked as minor or victimless. The court’s role in deterrence, public protection, and denunciation remains paramount.  

More recently, in R v. Gale [2022] EWCA Crim 1433, which involved persistent cannabis supply offences proximate to vulnerable communities, the sentencing court delineated the impact of targeting social environments already under strain, a consideration applicable in an adapted form where offences disrupt vulnerable commercial actors.  

Of perhaps passing interest, though not relevant to the defendant personally, is the case of R v. Bentham [2021] EWCA Crim 1705. There the accused was convicted of fly-tipping significant volumes of hazardous waste on protected greenbelt land, resulting in a 30-month custodial term. The imposition of a severe penalty for what might be culturally viewed as “environmental vandalism” reflects evolving judicial awareness of harm beyond immediate direct victims—an awareness not inconsistent with concerns about the indirect community impact of shoplifting.  

It bears repeated emphasis that the current case, while centred on low-value thefts, must be considered as a sustained course of conduct. The court is not confined to sentencing for the nominal value involved in individual incidents but rather for the calculated accumulation of behaviour.  

Facts of the Offending  
The offending activity spanned numerous premises including retail outlets located in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, Salford Precinct, and the Stockport district. Surveillance records, combined with stock reconciliation audits, revealed a pattern of repeated removal of small but high-demand items.

These actions, while individually appearing minor, exhibit a coherent, intentional modus operandi that exploited identifiable security weaknesses at individual stores. The offences were not opportunistic in the casual sense, but rather the outcome of deliberation and adaptability.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

The use of distraction techniques was noted by several witnesses. In some instances, you were observed feigning phone calls, employing clothing to obscure merchandise, or creating diversions by momentarily engaging other customers. One staff member detailed feeling increasingly anxious about your presence, leading to restricted movement around the store and altered shift patterns. This had an inevitable effect on workplace morale.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

The sophistication of your approach increased over time. There are recorded instances of using multiple exit points, switching between unregistered payment methods, and swapping items between bags during the course of shopping. This suggests either prior experience or learning through repetition.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

In consequence, some retailers reported an escalation in security costs, including the introduction of additional CCTV cameras, tagging systems, and routine bag checks. Such measures, however necessary, impose further burdens on small businesses already coping with the economic challenges of post-Brexit supply chain disruption and the ongoing energy crisis.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

Crucially, the cumulative financial loss sustained by targeted retailers exceeds £2,500. While each individual theft could be classed as low-value, it is the aggregate economic effect combined with disruption and distress to staff and customers that informs the court’s assessment.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

Despite prior warnings and interventions from local community policing teams—tailored diversion efforts including referral to drug and financial counselling services—there was limited engagement on your part.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

Finally, the evidence establishes that following a Conditional Caution in April 2024, compliance with its terms was partial at best. You failed to maintain contact with support providers and resumed offending within weeks.

Expert and Risk Assessments  
The psychological evaluation conducted by Mr Fuller distinguished between clinically diagnosed disorders and personality traits indicating vulnerability to impulsive and opportunistic decision-making. The report highlighted no major mental illness but diagnosed mild depressive symptoms and noted tendencies toward avoidance behaviour in stressful situations. Potential co-occurring mild alcohol misuse was also documented, though this was not deemed to significantly impair cognitive function or criminal responsibility.  

The probation assessment emphasises risk factors including social instability, inconsistencies in accommodation status, and limited meaningful structured activity. It also reports positive engagement with community probation officers during brief periods but flags repeated noncompliance and poor insight into the wider implications of offending behaviour. This synthesis of clinical and probation input informs the sentencing options available.  

The court is obliged to commend the continued charitable support provided by organisations such as Manchester Outreach Initiative, which have endeavoured to maintain engagement with you despite these difficulties. Their multi-disciplinary approach encompassing housing, substance misuse, and employment support stands as a laudable example of holistic intervention.  

You are aged 34 and have previous convictions, predominantly for shoplifting. There are no indications of gang affiliation or organised crime involvement. Family support networks are tenuous but present, with correspondence received from your sister highlighting your current unstable housing status and advocating for a community sentence.  

Sentencing Considerations  
The pattern of your offending is marked by persistence and planning. While lower in severity than violent or sexual offences, repeated theft has a corrosive effect on individual victims and the wider community, particularly smaller retailers. Staff affected have expressed distress, diminished feelings of safety, and economic impact stretching beyond immediate losses.  

Your guilty plea was entered at this hearing. The timing of that plea limits the extent of credit available. Consistent with the principle articulated in R v. Moreland [2023] EWCA Crim 1304, where the plea comes only at the point of assured conviction, credit is diminished relative to an early admission.  

By way of procedural context, the Criminal Procedure Rules advise that timely pleas aid efficient justice and spare victims from the stress of trial preparation. Unfortunately, the late plea in this case is one among many reflecting a wider trend observed over recent years.  

The court is also mindful of the growing case law addressing the balance between punishment and rehabilitation. As set out in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guideline (2024), where rehabilitation and treatment hold promise, appropriate community measures should be considered. However, where offending demonstrates calculated persistence despite prior interventions, immediate custody is often warranted.  

The court also takes account of wider societal considerations. Current national statistics indicate a worrying surge in acquisitive crime, linked to pressures including cost-of-living rises, economic insecurity, and local deprivation. While such factors elucidate context, they cannot excuse conduct causing harm or undermine the imperative for accountability.  

In addition, it is worth noting that the case was adjourned on two occasions to enable detailed analysis of your mental health and social circumstances. Such assessments provide a fuller and more just basis for sentencing decisions. The court must exercise care not to conflate vulnerability with excuse, nor to fetishise rehabilitation at the expense of public protection.  

I hereby order the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, expressly detailing viable options within community sentencing programmes, including enhanced supervision, rehabilitative requirements addressing impulsivity, and financial management support. The report should evaluate the suitability of a cognitive behavioural therapy course, alongside drug and alcohol misuse interventions if indicated.  

The court nonetheless warns that, given the chronic nature of your offending and limited prior engagement, custody remains a significant sentencing possibility. The balance must be struck between deterrence, punishment, and the possibility of reintegration under structured terms.  

Local probation services report significant staffing shortages, currently operating at 75% of establishment levels, which affects their capacity to offer tailored and intensive supervision. Equally, housing services face acute pressure, with prolonged waiting lists for supported accommodation. These systemic issues, while extrinsic, influence sentencing outcomes indirectly; the court is alarmed by such constraints on the efficacy of rehabilitative measures.  

The matter will return to this court once the pre-sentence report is received and examined. At that point, sentencing will be finalised.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 30 September 2025, at Manchester Crown Court, Court 5. Proceedings have been recorded in full compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his statutory right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs remain reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
