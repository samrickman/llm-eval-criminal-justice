IN THE CROWN COURT AT COVENTRY  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/03125  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. N. WILDER  
Delivered: 17 August 2026  

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentencing arising from offences of theft, specifically shoplifting, alleged and subsequently admitted to have been committed over a sustained period across multiple retail establishments within Coventry and the adjoining districts. The charge is brought pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, reflecting a pattern of dishonesty targeting commercial premises over the course of approximately eighteen months.

Procedural History  
The genesis of this prosecution lies in a series of reports submitted by retailers operating within Coventry’s main commercial core. The initial complaint was lodged on 12 January 2026, after a retail outlet specialising in health and beauty products recorded suspicious activity over the preceding weeks. This prompted the involvement of the Coventry Retail Crime Unit which, coordinating closely with the West Midlands Business Crime Partnership, undertook a multi-agency inquiry that involved extensive review of security footage, witness interviews, and the gathering of forensic evidence.  
It is a known and regrettable fact that cases of repeated shoplifting often demand considerable time and resource investment from public authorities and private stakeholders alike. While superficially typified as “low-value” crimes, their cumulative impact undermines both local economies and community cohesion. Indeed, as the Sentencing Council acknowledges in its Theft guideline preamble, the cumulative damage and psychological strain on staff and local economies should not be underestimated.

Your arrest occurred on 23 May 2026 following a coordinated operation by the Coventry Police’s Economic Crime Unit. The operation was facilitated by close collaboration with store management and private security teams, who had collated a detailed offender profile. At the time of arrest, you were found in possession of several articles consistent with the allegations of multiple thefts. You were taken into custody and later charged on 30 May 2026.

Throughout the pre-trial phase, the case proceeded under the Better Case Management (BCM) provisions, with listings conducted in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules. While such cases commonly experience procedural delays, this matter progressed with relative efficiency, with the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 15 July 2026. It is pertinent to note, however, that certain delays were occasioned by issues with securing prompt Legal Aid funding for expert instruction, particularly concerning psychiatric assessment. This is an ongoing concern for the court’s operational capacity, often placing undue stress on all those involved, including court staff, defence counsel, and the defendant.

A psychological assessment was eventually prepared by Dr Samantha Idris, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, whose detailed report was provided to the court on 29 July 2026. The report outlines relevant findings which I shall refer to shortly.

I welcome the input of both the prosecution and defence counsel on this sentencing hearing. I thank Ms Laura Kingsley, instructed on behalf of the Crown, and Mr Edward Bramwell, acting for the defence under a representation order granted by the Legal Aid Agency.

It is customary at this juncture for the court to reflect briefly on the broader societal context within which offences of this nature are committed. Over recent years, national statistics have borne witness to a troubling upward trajectory in shoplifting offences, notably exacerbated by economic pressures, the cost-of-living crisis, and evolving retail security challenges. While shops and shopping centres have introduced sophisticated loss prevention technology, offenders continue to exploit new vulnerabilities.  
The Business Crime Reduction Partnership model remains the principal framework through which multi-agency collaboration seeks to mitigate harm and reduce offending. However, local practitioners report that the burden of managing acquisitive crime often falls disproportionately on retail workers and volunteers, a fact which bears emotive consideration in sentencing.

In this context one cannot ignore the persistent shortage of frontline police officers, reported last month by the West Midlands Police Force as standing at some 12% below establishment—a factor that feeds through to slower response times and diminished investigative capacity. This institutional strain compounds the challenges faced by courts seeking to administer timely and effective justice.  
Likewise, the Probation Service continues to report recruitment and retention difficulties, complicating the provision of robust supervision and bespoke offender intervention. These systemic pressures, while peripheral to the facts of this case, form part of the backdrop against which contemporary court decisions unfold.

It is also appropriate to acknowledge, albeit briefly, that no two retailers are alike in their operational vulnerabilities or capacity to absorb loss. Independently owned suppliers face existential threats from shrinkage which, in some cases, results in permanent closure, loss of employment, and erosion of community vitality. Larger retail chains, while more resilient, deploy extensive internal security resources but nonetheless suffer cumulative financial harm that ultimately impacts consumer pricing and service levels.

In considering your case, the court is reminded of the jurisprudence relating to pleural offences committed in multiple premises. In R v. Middleton [2019] EWCA Crim 2096, the Court of Appeal underscored that the repetitive and calculated nature of theft from several locations elevates culpability even where individual acts may be low value. Notably, in Middleton, the defendant methodically targeted high-demand goods and leveraged familiarity with store security routines. The sentence passed—12 months custody—reflected the cumulative and premeditated conduct.

Similarly, in R v. Ellis [2020] EWCA Crim 1223, involving a defendant convicted of theft from various convenience stores, the Court affirmed that while individual thefts may appear minor, the overall criminal conduct is to be assessed cumulatively, with appropriate emphasis on persistence and indication of unwillingness to desist. These decided cases provide context for the court’s approach to sentencing you, Mr H.

Whilst these cases represent remote legal framework, it is also worth noting the continued evolution of sentencing protocols. The latest Theft Act 1968 Sentencing Council guidelines stress consideration of aggravating and mitigating factors not only in relation to monetary value but also impact on victims and public confidence.

I must also record that the court has received correspondence from the Coventry Retail Workers’ Union. Their letter, dated 2 August 2026, draws attention to the sustained impact of repeat shoplifting on worker morale, citing increased anxiety and reduced job satisfaction. While such submissions are rare in lower-level theft cases, the court gives due weight to their perspective.

The factual matrix herein is one characterised by clear planning and the exploitation of identifiable vulnerabilities within retail environments. On several occasions you were observed by staff employing ruses to distract or mislead, frequently utilising seemingly innocuous or casual demeanours to avoid suspicion. The level of sophistication in disguise tactics and timing also signifies forethought inconsistent with simplistic opportunism.

The court is cognisant of the findings in R v Bristow [2018] EWCA Crim 1226. In that matter, the defendant was found to have targeted pharmacy outlets repeatedly, using deception to bypass security measures. The Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence of 10 months, citing the deliberate targeting of safeguarding-sensitive goods and the psychological toll on vulnerable retail workers. Although the circumstances of the Bristow case differ, its reasoning informs current sentencing principles.

It is also relevant to observe the statutory scheme governing property offences. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 enshrines the requirement of dishonesty and the intention permanently to deprive. Acquittal may be possible where this is in dispute, but in the present matter, the plea of guilty extinguishes such issue.

Your antecedents demonstrate a pattern of similar offending. Your criminal record includes prior convictions for shoplifting in 2019 and 2023. The sentencing judge in 2023, in Coventry Magistrates’ Court, elected to impose a community order which provided for unpaid work and attendance at a Reparation Programme. Regrettably, the evidence and probation reports show limited compliance and no significant desistance, culminating in the present charge.

It is regrettable that attempts at diversion or community intervention did not achieve the intended rehabilitative outcomes, a conclusion shared by the Probation Service and articulated in their presentence report received on 10 August 2026.

These facts, taken with your history, demonstrate a persistent disregard for legal boundaries and public property rights. Moreover, the impact on those whom you deprived—the retailers, their employees, and local consumers—is by no means trivial. The economic cost, while clearly quantifiable in pound sterling, is compounded by the human consequences, including reduced confidence and increased anxiety for retail staff subjected to repeated loss and confrontation.

The pre-sentence report makes detailed reference to your personal circumstances, including financial hardship, housing instability, and reported episodes of anxiety and depression. While the court is naturally sympathetic to individual difficulties, it must be stressed that such factors are not determinative in isolation and do not excuse repeated offending. Nor should pity eclipse the primary considerations of public protection and deterrence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

I have reflected carefully on Dr Idris’s psychological assessment. Her report, dated 29 July 2026, concludes that while you exhibit no diagnosable severe mental illness, you demonstrate impulsive traits and moderate emotional dysregulation. Importantly, the psychologist highlights an undercurrent of low self-esteem and a pervasive sense of social alienation, compounded by unresolved trauma sustained in adolescence. These are presented as contributory factors rather than causal explanations.

Indeed, it is often observed in forensic psychology that underlying psychological vulnerabilities may predispose individuals towards offending behaviour but do not negate responsibility. Therein lies a fine but critical distinction.

Additionally, the report notes a lack of engagement with available mental health support services, despite repeated offers from liaison workers and voluntary sector organisations. This rejection of support, while within your autonomy, invites concern regarding longer-term risks and the efficacy of community-based intervention
