IN THE CROWN COURT AT BELMONT  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14687  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Penelope R. MONTGOMERY  
Filed: 12 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced for offences of theft, more precisely shoplifting, committed over a sustained period. The charges before the court allege a course of conduct involving multiple thefts from retail establishments located within the metropolitan and suburban districts of Belmont and its adjoining boroughs, spanning from late 2023 through to early 2025.

Procedural Background  
Your arrest took place on 18 February 2025, following an extensive investigation involving coordinated efforts by the Belmont Metropolitan Police Retail Crime Unit, the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), and officers assigned to the Safer Neighbourhoods Team. This multi-agency investigation was initiated in response to an accumulation of reported thefts at various stores predominantly frequented by pedestrians in commercially dense areas — predominantly small supermarkets and independent pharmacies.

It must be observed that the investigation’s success was, in significant part, due to the diligence of store security personnel who maintained electronic logs, flagged unusual patterns, and liaised effectively with police—actions that, while commendable, reflect the increasing burden placed on commercial entities in responding to repeat acquisitive offending. The court is mindful that despite advances in surveillance technology, the practical realities of evidence gathering in shoplifting cases remain demanding. The quality, clarity, and continuity of CCTV footage often vary considerably, and identification frequently relies on the painstaking comparison of partial images, gait analysis, and corroborative witness testimony.

Your case was listed initially for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 2 March 2025 before being adjourned at the defence’s request to secure instructed expert psychiatric evidence. The request was accompanied by representations seeking to explore the possibility that your offending may have been influenced by underlying mental health factors — a proposition that informed the application for an independent psychiatric assessment, subsequently conducted by Dr Felicity Harding, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist. Her report, dated 29 July 2025, provides considered observations regarding your mental state and risk profile.

Crown and Defence Submissions  
The Crown, appearing by Ms Lara Jenkins, submits that the offending was protracted, systematic, and involved consistent disregard for warning and prior diversionary attempts. It emphasises the economic and psychological impact upon retailers and their staff, particularly those working in low-waged, frontline positions, who bear the brunt of repeated shoplifting. The prosecution invites the court to take a firm approach reflective of the pattern of offending and your apparent reluctance to engage meaningfully with available support.

Mr Andrew Jessop, instructed under a Legal Aid representation order, appears for the defence. He underscores the mitigating circumstances outlined in the psychiatric report, draws attention to your expressed remorse and social circumstances, including temporary accommodation arranged by the local authority. The defence invites the court to consider all realistic community-based options, noting your willingness to participate in rehabilitative programmes and desisting from further offending.

It should not go unrecorded that the allocation and procurement of competent legal representation have been partially hampered by delays in the administration of Legal Aid resources. The request to instruct external experts faced procedural hurdles before eventual approval, a matter that this court duly notes with concern given the significance of such assessments in mitigating risk and identifying intervention necessity.

The wider context of your case falls squarely within the remit of the Better Case Management regime introduced in 2017, which aims to reduce delay and improve case progression. The present proceedings unfolded within prescribed timeframes, save for an adjournment occasioned by a late request to add witness statements from a family member and letters of support from local charities engaged in homelessness prevention work.

The facts of the offending are relatively straightforward, notwithstanding the inherent complexities of evidence collation in retail crime contexts. Your acts were carefully observed and documented by store employees, CCTV operators, and subsequently validated through forensic examinations of recovered property.

It bears noting that the courts have progressively emphasized that shoplifting, while commonly viewed as low-level crime, must be approached with due seriousness where patterns of repetition and targeting emerge. As observed in R v Mulgrew [2021] EWCA Crim 842, a case concerning systematic theft from charity shops, the Court of Appeal underscored the cumulative harm — both material and psychological — caused by prolonged acquisitive offending. Similarly, the decision in R v Offord [2022] EWCA Crim 2435 reflects that deterrence is a critical consideration where offenders persist despite prior community interventions.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

During the hearing and throughout the preparation of this case, the involvement and efforts of organisations providing victim support and restorative services cannot be overlooked. The Belmont Retail Staff Support Network, a voluntary initiative working with employees affected by shoplifting, submitted a detailed impact statement documenting the distress and heightened anxiety reported across several outlets. The Network’s reports emphasize the increased incidence of short-notice absenteeism and loss of confidence among staff tasked with preventing theft—effects that ripple outward to affect store traffic and community perceptions of safety.

Mental Health and Risk Assessment  
Dr Harding’s report outlines that, while you do not meet criteria for severe enduring mental illness, there exist identifiable traits consistent with an impulse control disorder compounded by socio-economic stressors. The psychiatrist posits that these features, alongside episodic substance misuse predominantly involving alcohol, may have contributed to diminished inhibitions and impaired decision-making. The report, however, acknowledges your ability to understand the nature and wrongfulness of the acts, fitting squarely within the legal framework for criminal responsibility.

I take this opportunity to note the severe pressures faced by forensic mental health services, which continue to experience extended waiting lists and resource constraints exacerbated by recent waves of staff vacancies and increased referral rates. Such systemic limitations inevitably affect the timeliness and breadth of interventions available to defendants, a factor that courts must consider with cautious understanding.

You are aged 35. Your previous convictions consist chiefly of similar theft offences, with three prior entries, the most recent dating from 2021, resulting then in a community resolution. That prior disposal failed to prevent reoffending. No evidence emerged of involvement in organised crime nor association with gangs. There are no forthcoming charges or ongoing investigations linked directly or indirectly to your person.

The pre-sentence probation report paints a complex picture. The probation officer highlights your unstable housing situation, sporadic employment history, and inconsistent engagement with job-seeking initiatives and drug and alcohol services. There is, however, noted willingness to participate in structured rehabilitation if adequately supported. The report expresses guarded optimism for success within a robust, tailored community sentencing framework but flags the risk of recidivism in the absence of strong supervision and engagement.

The courts recognize that, in the present era, no sentence can be considered in isolation from the broader challenges faced by criminal justice and social care systems. Staffing shortages in probation and mental health crisis teams, rising homelessness, and stretched local authority resources have become frequent topics of judicial commentary in recent years. These pressures undoubtedly complicate efforts to rehabilitate offenders and protect the public but do not excuse offending behaviour.

It would be remiss not to comment on the recent spate of intelligence reports concerning the use of counterfeit electronic payment devices in the region, which have occasioned considerable police attention but bear no relevance to the facts or participants in this case. Similarly, there are ongoing investigations involving co-defendants in separate pawnshop-related offences that have been charted in several local news reports but do not pertain to you.

Legal Framework and Sentencing Guidelines  
The court proceeds in accordance with section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 and refers to Sentencing Council guidelines on theft offences issued most recently in 2023. The guidelines emphasize the need to assess culpability, harm, and any protective factors. Persistent offending, targeting of vulnerable proprietors or employees, and failure to desist after previous interventions are all material aggravating features.

In R v. Connolly [2019] EWCA Crim 645, the Court of Appeal reiterated that credit for guilty pleas depends on timeliness and extent of responsibility admitted. Where pleas are entered late — particularly after evidence has been fully prepared — reduced discount is warranted. Mr H’s plea was changed to guilty at the penultimate hearing rather than at the earliest opportunity, which will be factored accordingly.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

It is well established that community orders carrying requirements for rehabilitation, unpaid work, and supervision may be effective when underpinned by genuine engagement and tailored interventions. Where such conditions are unlikely to be complied with, or where offending demonstrates sustained disregard for law and social order, custodial sentences may be appropriate. This balance will be determined post-receipt of the probation report and ancillary documentation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

The court’s focus remains squarely on public protection, deterrence, and the potential for rehabilitation. It is mindful of the constant challenge to navigate between firmness and fairness, especially in cases where social and mental health complexities intertwine with criminal misconduct.

Further Representations and Procedural Matters  
Several letters of support have been submitted on your behalf by staff at the Belmont Homeless Support Centre and a local charity working with individuals suffering from substance dependency. These testimonials commend your courteous demeanour and evident desire to resolve your difficulties, while also acknowledging the obstacles posed by systemic underfunding of relevant services.

The timely production of these materials, along with a statement from your elder sister, was a determining factor in this court’s decision to adjourn the original sentence hearing by four weeks to afford a measured appraisal of your circumstances. In that respect, credit is due to your legal team for their conscientious advocacy and to the court administration for accommodating this schedule despite significant listing pressures affecting the courtroom, a consequence in part of recent strike actions by court clerks.

It is further recorded that this courtroom underwent refurbishment over this summer, resulting in improved accessibility and the installation of updated electronic evidence display technology. While ancillary to the present matter, such enhancements reflect ongoing efforts to modernize judicial facilities and improve public access to court processes.

I extend my thanks to the usher and courtroom staff who have facilitated smooth proceedings despite intermittent challenges presented by delayed arrival of interpreter services and the need for social distancing measures imposed by public health guidance.

Conclusion and Next Steps  
This court reserves the final sentencing determination until the pre-sentence report from probation has been received and fully considered alongside all relevant materials, including any updated psychiatric assessments or further representations from the defence or prosecution.

You are reminded that the preparation of such reports, while necessarily thorough, may take several weeks, given current workloads and competing priorities within the probation service. I ask the probation officer to include, in the report, assessment of your risk to the public, prospects for rehabilitation, suitability for community-based interventions — including cognitive skills programmes — and the feasibility of integrating support relating to housing stability and substance misuse.

The court acknowledges the significant tensions facing all agencies involved — from police officers stretched thin by competing demands, to voluntary sector groups operating with diminished funding, and the enduring struggles within mental health services. These systemic factors, while noted, cannot detract from the individual accountability that the justice system requires.

The hearing has been conducted in open court, with all parties present. I thank Ms Lara Jenkins for her diligent prosecution, Mr Andrew Jessop for his careful and considered defence representations, and all court staff for their assistance.

These are the sentencing remarks of Her Honour Judge Penelope R. Montgomery, issued on 12 October 2025 in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Belmont. Proceedings have been recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are advised of your right to appeal the sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged by statute or order.

These are the orders of the court.
