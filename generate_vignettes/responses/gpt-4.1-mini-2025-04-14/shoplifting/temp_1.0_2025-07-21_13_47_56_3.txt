IN THE CROWN COURT AT HIGHGATE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. C2025/15867  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Frederica A. Bromley  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing in respect of offences committed contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically multiple counts of theft from retail premises. The conduct in question covers a period between the spring of 2023 and early summer 2025, predominantly within the Highgate, Holloway, and Archway areas. The matter has been transferred from the Magistrates’ Court owing to the scale and complexity of the offending and the necessity for Crown Court disposal.

Procedural Context  
Your initial appearance was recorded at Holloway Magistrates’ Court on 24 May 2025 where you entered a not guilty plea. Following continued investigation, additional evidence was presented, and by the date of the plea and trial preparation hearing on 18 July 2025, you indicated a change of position, entering a guilty plea to a representative charge encompassing the offending conduct. The case was then set down for sentencing on today’s date.

The pathway through which this matter has travelled reflects the often arduous and fragmented nature of modern criminal procedure in matters involving retail theft. The incremental accumulations of evidence, the sometimes competing demands of Legal Aid authorisation, and the involvement of multiple agencies have all shaped the progression of this case. I wish to place on record, with some reluctance, the frustrations occasioned by repeated and avoidable delays in securing funding approval for psychiatric assessment reports essential to sentencing. Mr H’s defence team made an application on 28 June which was not fully resolved until late August. Such bureaucratic inertia, pervasive across many jurisdictions, serves neither justice nor the individuals whom it purports to serve.

It is also pertinent to observe the broader operational pressures currently faced by custodial and probationary services nationally. Staff shortages in Probation Trusts continue to adversely affect report preparation times and the availability of community intervention programmes. Consequently, sentences necessitating community-based orders frequently risk being less effective, or less promptly implemented, than would be ideal. These challenges weigh heavily on sentencing decisions where public protection and rehabilitation must be carefully balanced.

This court is cognisant, further, of the demanding caseload borne by the Highgate Business Crime Reduction Unit. Their committed and conscientious efforts in collating multi-source intelligence and facilitating liaison between victim retailers and law enforcement have materially contributed to the evidential basis necessary for this prosecution. Without their dedicated involvement, securing conviction in such cases would be all the more difficult. I acknowledge the valuable input of senior officer PC Naomi Winslow, whose careful direction of the investigation has been instrumental.

Defence solicitors have submitted a suite of mitigation documents, including letters from Mr H’s sister, Ms. Evangeline H., and correspondence from the North London Community Support Forum. The latter entity, despite current funding constraints and reduced operational capacity due to recent local government cutbacks, maintains an advocacy role for persons affected by homelessness and poverty. Their engagement with Mr H has been intermittent but earnest, and I note their request that any custodial sentence incorporate access to mental health and substance misuse services.

In light of the preceding, I commend the appointed defence counsel, Mr Stephen Carver, for his consistently professional and measured advocacy. The twin duties of effective representation and case management have been discharged within exacting resource limits. Similarly, Ms Amanda Leighton, appearing to represent the Crown, has presented the prosecution case with clarity and rigour, enabling this court to reach a comprehensive understanding of the factual matrix.

Background and Legal Framework  
The Theft Act 1968, as amended, provides at section 1 a broad prohibition on dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another, with intent to permanently deprive. The statutory framework contemplates a diversity of offending, from opportunistic to systematic theft, addressing a spectrum ranging from isolated minor incidents to sustained, planned courses of criminal conduct. While low-value retail thefts are often managed in summary courts, the court recognises that a pattern of repeat offending involving multiple locations and temporal breadth demands proportionate response.

The sentencing guideline for theft offences, as published by the Sentencing Council, stresses the significance of a number of aggravating and mitigating factors. Relevant aggravators include repeat offending, planning or sophistication, use of distraction techniques, targeting vulnerable businesses, or causing psychological distress to staff. Mitigating aspects may comprise early guilty plea, genuine remorse, personal circumstances such as deprivation or mental health issues, and efforts at reparation.

Judicial authority further provides guidance as to how the timing of guilty pleas influences sentence discount. The Court of Appeal in R v. Bellamy [2023] EWCA Crim 2012 reiterated that credit for plea is not automatic but contingent on the timing and motivation underlying the admission. Late pleas, entered only when conviction becomes inevitable, attract substantially reduced reductions.

Likewise, the case of R v. Farnsworth [2021] EWCA Crim 1539, dealing with repeat acquisitive offending, emphasised the necessity of deterrence and public protection when offenders disregard prior interventions and warnings.

It is noteworthy that although the defendant in R v. Sims [2020] EWCA Crim 986 carried convictions extending to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and possession of a bladed article, the Court cautioned against conflating unrelated previous offences with current proceedings unless directly relevant to culpability or risk.

Similarly, cases including R v. Hudson [2019] EWCA Crim 1176, which addressed fly-tipping in rural greenbelt zones resulting in environmental harm, while referencing the importance of protecting public spaces, bear no direct applicability in this matter.

It is therefore essential that any sentencing decision here remain focused on the specific facts and context of Mr H’s offending, not ancillary matters from co-defendants or unrelated cohabitees. The court is mindful of the necessity to avoid the taint of guilt by association or collateral immaterial conduct.

Details of the Offending  
The facts of the offending are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

The evidence assembled comprises a combination of CCTV footage, witness statements from retail staff, and recovered property. Several stores across the three specified boroughs reported noticeable losses over recurring visits by an individual matching your description, supported by identification photographs and employee testimony.

The use of specific methods was recorded, including the use of concealed compartments within clothing, deliberate timing to coincide with staff breaks, and occasionally wearing disguising accessories such as hats or scarves. These actions support a conclusion of deliberate, calculated behaviour rather than spontaneous or opportunistic lapses.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

Though no direct threats or violence were recorded, the atmosphere of intimidation experienced by staff caused measurable distress, affecting morale and contributing to turnover as employees sought change to avoid contact.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Further, the cumulative financial impact has been non-trivial, straining small businesses operating on narrow margins, some of which have reported reconsidering their continued presence in affected localities due to repeated shrinkage.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

The court notes also the documented police encounter on 11 April 2025 during which a co-defendant unrelated to these specific thefts was arrested nearby on separate charges concerning affray following a public house altercation involving pool cues. Whilst of interest in the broader case titling, that episode bears no direct connection to Mr H’s offending and should not influence sentencing.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Accounts from the Safer Neighbourhood Team indicate that despite previous interventions, including community resolution offers and a conditional caution issued in late 2024, the offending pattern persisted unabated.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

More concerningly, it appears that warnings provided by local housing officers regarding noise abatement and antisocial conduct linked to your flat were disregarded, compounding tensions in your neighbourhood though these do not themselves form part of the charge before the court.

Psychiatric and Pre-Sentence Report  
I have carefully considered the psychiatric assessment prepared by Dr Julian Fisher, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose detailed and professionally composed report was submitted on 1 September 2025. Dr Fisher highlights the absence of any formal diagnosis of severe mental illness but draws attention to traits consistent with anxiety, episodic depressive symptoms, and a possible emerging substance misuse disorder relating to alcohol and over-the-counter analgesics.

The report stresses your partial non-engagement with recommended support services and your reluctance to pursue employment or education opportunities. A pertinent observation is the presence of impulsivity and an underdeveloped insight into the consequences of offending.

It merits emphasis that while genuine vulnerability exists, it does not equate to an absence of personal responsibility. The notion of “trauma-informed” responses—while vital to contemporary probation practice—must be balanced against the enduring need for public protection and accountability.

The pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Ms. Clare Duncan, dated 5 September 2025, echoes these findings. She observes moderate levels of risk of reoffending and low risk of harm to others, and recommends interventions including cognitive skills training, substance misuse counselling, and financial management assistance. Ms. Duncan notes the strain placed upon probation services by current vacancies and increasing caseloads, resulting in delays to report submissions and interventions.

Letters submitted on your behalf from the Community Food Bank and Crisis Support Network commend your engagement with voluntary sectors but raise concerns about relapse and housing insecurity. The latter is shared by the North London Civic Response Trust, which has acknowledged multiple emergency calls relating to your temporary accommodation during the past six months.

Notably, your handwritten letter to the court is legible, carefully organised, and evinces a degree of reflection, although the court notes some inconsistencies in your account of family support and substance use history.

Public and Institutional Observations  
The court is constrained to mention the ongoing and regrettable dissatisfaction with the Legal Aid Agency expressed by practitioners in cases such as this. Procedural delays in approving applications for psychiatric expertise remain a barrier, and the agency’s administrative processes are often criticised for opacity and inflexibility. These systemic frustrations reverberate not only here but throughout the wider justice system.

Moreover, the increasingly prevalent norm of late-stage guilty pleas in acquisitive crime cases imposes significant burdens on witnesses, victims, and the court itself. While recognising the defendant’s right to test the case, counsel must appreciate the consequences of tactical delays. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed reduced credit where pleas arise only after the collapse of trial or evidentiary challenges.

In a wider social context, the court acknowledges the chronic challenges posed by street homelessness and economic instability, factors which in many instances contribute to pathways into criminal conduct. Local voluntary organisations—such as the Highgate Outreach Partnership and the Borough Housing Aid Trust—operate under severe resource constraints but continue to provide vital support. Their contributions, often unheralded, form the bedrock upon which many rely.

The court notes with regret that despite the theoretical existence of multiple diversion schemes and rehabilitation frameworks, there remains a gap between availability and uptake. This case underscores the importance of robust inter-agency cooperation, including the role of business crime partnerships, community outreach teams, and probation services working collaboratively.

I additionally draw attention to the recently refurbished courtroom layout, now better equipped with digital evidence presentation facilities, contributing to the effective conduct of proceedings. The court ushers and clerks have again been commendable in ensuring smooth administration and maintaining order notwithstanding some delays in interpreter availability for an unrelated matter earlier in the day.

Sentencing Considerations and Conclusion  
In reaching sentence, I weigh the gravity of a course of conduct characterised by persistence, planning, and disregard for prior warnings, against personal circumstances of vulnerability and partial cooperation.

The aggravating features—continuity of offending despite intervention, targeting of vulnerable retail outlets, and the resultant impact on staff welfare and local businesses—cannot be downplayed. This pattern evidences significant culpability and undermines community confidence.

Conversely, mitigating features, including your admission of guilt prior to trial, the presence of some degree of personal adversity, and engagement with support groups, warrant recognition.

Ultimately, the court must balance rehabilitation opportunities with the imperative to protect the public and deliver appropriate punishment and deterrence.

I will order the preparation of an up-to-date pre-sentence report before final disposal of sentence. This report should evaluate the feasibility of a community order incorporating cognitive behavioural therapy and substance misuse treatment. Consideration should also be given to any viable reparation measures.

These sentencing remarks are delivered on 14 September 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Highgate. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal conviction or sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
