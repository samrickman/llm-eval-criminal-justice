IN THE CROWN COURT AT PORTSMOUTH  
R v. MR H  
Case No. P2025/15432  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. M. SUTHERLAND  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today to receive sentence in respect of your admitted involvement in a course of conduct amounting to offences of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This conduct is comprised in a representative indictment, which encapsulates a series of shoplifting episodes occurring between the months of February 2023 and July 2025, involving multiple commercial retail establishments within the jurisdiction of Portsmouth and its environs.

Procedural History  
The origins of this prosecution trace back to a protracted investigation initiated by the local territorial police force, with active involvement from the Portsmouth Business Crime Partnership (PBCP). This multi-agency task group, established in 2014 with the express purpose of pooling intelligence and coordinating the business community’s response to retail crime, has on occasion been noted in this jurisdiction for its variable levels of efficacy. While on paper the Partnership promises a seamless interface between law enforcement, store security personnel, and council enforcement officers, in practice it has struggled with intermittent data-sharing compliance, notably attributed to staff turnover and funding constraints. On this occasion, however, the PBCP played an overt and constructive role, forwarding detailed incident reports and victim statements which materially assisted in the identification and eventual apprehension of the defendant.

It is right to observe at this juncture that similar offending patterns often impose disproportionately heavy burdens on front-line police officers. Offences involving theft from shops, frequently characterised as “minor” by external observers, require extensive resource expenditure: statements must be taken from witnesses often distracted or traumatised by repeat offending; evidence gathered and catalogued; and persistent surveillance or intelligence gathering undertaken. The demand on police time is acute, particularly against the backdrop of increasing volume in acquisitive crime amid broader reductions in officer numbers nationally. Ms. Linda Patterson, the detective inspector supervising this case, provided a detailed evidence summary highlighting the time-intensive nature of the investigation, which included review of over 200 hours of CCTV footage and the co-ordination of multi-agency responses across three borough policing teams.

Mr H was arrested on 9 August 2025 following the culmination of intelligence operations that integrated static and mobile surveillance, with key input from retail security specialists and the newly implemented Regional Digital Evidence Unit (RDEU). This latter organisation, established in 2021 to mitigate rising backlogs in forensic video analysis, has been subject to intermittent operational reviews, particularly concerning wait times for analytical reports and the prioritisation of cases. Notwithstanding these systemic challenges, the RDEU managed to provide timely forensic enhancement and liaison with store managers, which proved crucial to linking the defendant to several offences.

An initial hearing took place on 25 August 2025 at Portsmouth Magistrates’ Court where, following representation by Mr Elliott Stafford, your legal representative, bail was granted on stringent conditions including a curfew and reporting requirements. The case was subsequently committed to this crown court under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol. The BCM initiative aims to streamline prosecution timetables and reduce delay through early identification of issues, improved case preparation, and the timely service of evidence. It is to be noted that, consistent with the Criminal Procedure Rules, the listing of plea and trial preparation hearings adhered broadly to prescribed schedules, notwithstanding minor adjournments occasioned by defence applications and administrative factors beyond the control of this court.

On 18 September, following service of additional evidential material, including comprehensive retail chain statements and forensic accounting projections of loss, a plea and trial preparation hearing was convened. At that occasion you, Mr H, changed plea to guilty, albeit relatively late in the course of proceedings. The jurisprudence in this area is clear: credit for a guilty plea diminishes as the plea is delayed. As emphasised recently in the Court of Appeal decision of R v. Bentham [2024] EWCA Crim 504, a plea at the earliest reasonable opportunity ordinarily merits a reduction of up to one-third, whereas a plea entered days before trial may attract markedly less credit, sometimes as little as 10%.

It is therefore important to reiterate that while a guilty plea is a matter invariably relevant to sentence, it must not be treated as a matter of right or entitlement. The court requires to closely examine the circumstances that led to the timing of such pleas, mindful of the consequences for witnesses, victims, and public resources.

It is likewise pertinent to mention that the current proceedings have been the subject of some administrative delay, including a postponed psychological report due to difficulties in securing timely Legal Aid funding for expert instruction. This is regrettably not unusual in contemporary criminal justice practice, as the Legal Aid Agency continues to wrestle with budgetary constraints and procedural complexities which often lengthen case preparation periods to the detriment of all parties concerned.

The court is conscious that courts of this type, invested with sentencing jurisdiction pursuant to statute and common law, operate within a delicate balance. On one hand, they must demonstrate firmness in response to offending conduct; on the other, the justice system must strive for proportionality, recognising the sometimes complex social, psychological or economic factors that underpin offending behaviour.

Insofar as relevant comparable case law is concerned, attention may be directed to R v. Ellison [2023] EWCA Crim 1772, where the Court of Appeal upheld an immediate custodial sentence for repeated shoplifting from multiple outlets, including the use of distraction tactics and concealment of items of moderate value. The offender in Ellison had a similar criminal history, and the sentencing judge was commended for giving full weight to the cumulative impact on victims despite the relatively low monetary loss from each instance.

Equally, I note the observations in R v Maxwell [2018] EWCA Crim 1239, wherein the presence of prior convictions and the failure to engage with community-based rehabilitative schemes were cited as key reasons for refusal of suspended sentences. The jurisprudential consensus suggests that a sole custodial sentence might be appropriate when the offender demonstrates persistent disregard for improvised disposals, even when the offences themselves lack violence or significant financial loss.

We are reminded of the reality that shoplifting offences, while often dismissed in the wider public narrative as “minor,” have tangible effects on victims. Small and independent business holders, whose margins are already strained by inflationary pressure and supply chain disruptions, find repeated theft not only a financial blow but a psychological strain upon their employees. The Retail Sector Victim Support unit submitted a report in this case detailing such impacts, including decreased staff morale, shortened opening hours, and increased security costs. These are not abstract harms but real consequences with ripple effects across local economies.

It is worth touching upon the intricate relationship between sentencing decisions and rehabilitation. The probation service has contributed a comprehensive report prepared by Mrs Joanna Millar, a senior probation officer with over two decades’ experience in offender management. Mrs Millar’s report evaluates your circumstances, noting a long-standing history of unstable housing, intermittent employment, and inconsistent engagement with support services. Despite these, there is an absence of any diagnosed severe mental health disorder or substance dependency which might otherwise provide mitigating context. The probation report highlights a concerning pattern of non-compliance with prior community orders or informal diversion programmes, underscoring a limited readiness to address offending behaviour voluntarily.

To further supplement the court’s understanding, Dr Helen Fitzgerald, consultant clinical psychologist, was instructed to prepare a psychological assessment focusing on patterns of impulsivity, emotional regulation, and potential underlying cognitive impairments. Her detailed report, submitted on 10 September 2025, concludes that while there exist traits consistent with low frustration tolerance and occasional mood lability, these do not amount to clinical syndromes warranting hospitalisation or statutory mental health interventions. Dr Fitzgerald also emphasises the potential utility of cognitive behavioural therapy targeting acquisitive offending cognitions but also warns against over-optimistic expectations in light of previous disengagement.

It is thus incumbent upon this court to carefully weigh the relevance of these assessments against the imperative to protect the public and maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. The balance of punishment and rehabilitation remains a central feature of our sentencing framework.

I must also note, though it bears no discernible impact on your matter, the unfortunate ongoing industrial actions involving court administrative staff have, for several weeks, contributed to case backlog and listing difficulties within this crown court. These systemic labour disputes affect the entire criminal justice chain and underscore the pressures experienced by everyone engaged in due process.

The court has received several letters of support from family members and local community organisations, including a written submission from the Portsmouth Community Outreach Project, which works with individuals experiencing economic hardship and social isolation. While these letters emphasise your difficulties and urge for a compassionate approach, the court is obliged to balance such input with the realities of your offending and previous bail compliance.

It is also noteworthy that the case was briefly impeded by an administrative oversight regarding disclosure of CCTV footage from one retailer, which was subsequently rectified. The role of digital evidence in current prosecutions cannot be overstated: retired store employees and supervisory staff alike have relied heavily on electronic records, yet the processing and verification of such material is an ever-increasingly burdensome task for both police and prosecution teams. Indeed, delays in processing such evidence have been cited as a contributory factor in systemic pressures on the courts.

It behoves the court also to reflect on the broader societal context in which these offences were committed. The United Kingdom is presently grappling with a significant housing crisis marked by chronic shortages of affordable accommodation, exacerbating social instability for many vulnerable individuals. Government reports and independent charities alike have highlighted the precarious situation surrounding temporary accommodation, with many occupants reporting feelings of alienation, anxiety, and limited access to support services.

While these factors do not excuse criminality, they form an essential part of the backdrop against which this court must operate. They are part of the non-legal, perhaps socio-economic dimensions that any sentencer must acknowledge, albeit without allowing them to overshadow the core questions of culpability and risk.

That being said, the court remains alert to the necessity for clear messaging on deterrence. Repeat shop theft damages not only material interests but harms the social fabric through erosion of trust and community wellbeing.

Consideration is also given to the national sentencing framework, specifically the guidelines published by the Sentencing Council in 2023 concerning theft offences. These guidelines emphasise a careful calibrating of scale, harm, culpability, and offender characteristics. It is acknowledged that persistent offending and failure to respond to earlier warnings or conditional discharges are features that increase culpability.

The guideline further recognises the utility of community-based sentences when accompanied by rigorous requirements addressing resolved underlying causes. However, that option requires a reasonable expectation of compliance and engagement, which the probation report casts some doubt upon in your case.

This court must also guard against unwarranted leniency. As noted in R v. Dilworth [2019] EWCA Crim 1427, the Court of Appeal cautioned against sentences which insufficiently reflect the public interest in robust responses to repeat acquisitive crime, especially where prior diversion efforts have failed. Although the offences lack violence, their persistence and impact warrant measured sanction.

In determining sentence, I weigh the following factors: your personal mitigation, the late plea, your prior record, the nature and impact of the offences, current circumstances including housing instability, and expert reports indicating no severe mental illness but some personality vulnerabilities.

Sentencing options therefore include community orders with rehabilitative elements, suspended custodial sentences, or immediate custody, depending on what pre-sentence investigations reveal.

Before I conclude these remarks, I wish to place on record my thanks to Ms Felicity Arnott, who appears on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr Elliott Stafford for the defence. Both have conducted their responsibilities conscientiously. I also acknowledge the professionalism of the court staff and legal assistants who have managed scheduling amid the ongoing pressures of workload and external industrial disputes. The clarity and candour of the psychological and probationary reports are to be commended.

It remains regrettable that delays in securing legal aid permissions for expert instructions have extended the timeframes in this case, a systemic issue that merits policy attention.

You are reminded that the open nature of these proceedings
