IN THE CROWN COURT AT NORWICH  
R v. MR H  
Case No. N2025/15842  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. B. WALDRON  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for offences related to theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charges brought reflect a pattern of shoplifting activity spanning from September 2023 through to April 2025, involving a variety of independent and chain stores located primarily within the city centre of Norwich and the surrounding suburban boroughs.  

Procedural History  
The genesis of this case lies in a joint investigative operation spearheaded by the Norwich City Police Retail Crime Division, collaborating closely with the Norfolk Business Crime Partnership (NBCP)—a multi-agency coalition formed with the aim of reducing retail theft through intelligence sharing, enhanced surveillance, and robust prosecutorial action. The NBCP’s inception dates back to 2018, and while it has made appreciable strides in coordinating stakeholders, this court is aware that its efficacy varies considerably across its operational geography due to disparate funding streams and fluctuating engagement from partner agencies.  

Your apprehension followed a series of incidents documented over an 18-month period. Each incident by itself might have been deemed a minor infraction—an attempted concealment of a small item, a single item lifted with little apparent planning—but accumulated, your conduct represented an orchestrated series of acts that imposed disproportionate burdens on both business owners and law enforcement.  

Inter-agency efforts included the utilisation of advanced CCTV analytics, foot patrol data, and, notably, operational briefings involving the Safer Neighbourhood Teams which are tasked with community-level policing and local intelligence gathering. This latter collaboration was catalytic in forming a coherent narrative around the offending, although it must be noted that some limitations in data sharing protocols—especially concerning GDPR compliance and inter-agency memorandum of understanding—occasionally slowed progress. In a broader context, such procedural obstacles are not unique to this jurisdiction but are reflective of the challenges faced nationwide in tackling acquisitive crime within the constraints of legal and ethical frameworks.  

I would be remiss not to mention the additional complexity added by the temporal constraints on case management caused by the industrial action affecting Crown Court listing clerks and judicial officers earlier this year, which led to an unavoidable adjournment of approximately four weeks past the original trial date. Such delays, while regrettable, are the by-product of systemic pressures impacting the justice system’s capacity to promptly deal with the volume of cases presented daily. The court records its gratitude to all court staff who have managed to sustain operations amidst these challenges, an effort all-too-frequently overlooked.  

During your first hearing on 5 November 2024, you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequent evidential disclosure and forensic analysis—following a warrant executed at your registered address on 17 December 2024—revealed incriminating material, including recovered property items, which, alongside corroborating witness testimony, precipitated a change of plea to guilty on 12 February 2025. The timing of this plea was relatively late in proceedings, a factor that, as the appellate courts have consistently endorsed, mitigates in assessing the credit to which you are entitled.  

It is pertinent to reference the leading authority on plea discounting, R v. Rogers [2020] EWCA Crim 987, where the Court of Appeal underscored that recognition for a guilty plea is not an automatic benefit but one that must be earned by the promptness of admission and acknowledgment of wrongdoing. The Rogers judgment reaffirmed that late pleas, particularly those entered shortly before trial commencement, attract significantly reduced credit compared to early admissions, as they fail to spare witnesses from the stress of trial preparation and do not facilitate early case disposal.  

Equally instructive is the decision in R v. Matthews [2019] EWCA Crim 1354, which considered a series of burglaries against a domestic residence. Although markedly distinct in seriousness and nature, Matthews epitomises the principle that delay in acknowledging responsibility diminishes the mitigating weight of a guilty plea. Conservative application of these principles ensures sentencing consistency and public confidence in the judicial process.  

Occurrences of concurrent but unrelated offences, such as the affray committed by a different suspect in the vicinity of a Norfolk supermarket on 14 March 2024—resulting from a dispute involving pool cues—were examined by the prosecution, but there is no evidential nexus linking you to that conduct. Similarly, there have been no charges related to fly-tipping by any individual associated with this matter, despite periodic unlawful dumping reported in outlying green belt areas near Norwich. The court emphasises, however, that such unrelated offences find no bearing on the assessment of your culpability or risk.  

The Court has received and considered letters from several local organisations, including the Norwich Traders Association (NTA), who continue to advocate for increased public funding to support retailers impacted by shoplifting and antisocial behaviour. The NTA’s submissions highlight the ongoing challenges faced by smaller independent stores in managing security budgets and liaising with police services whose capacity to respond promptly is strained. Additionally, there were written appeals from the East Anglia Community Outreach (EACO), a charity specialising in assisting individuals with histories of addiction and homelessness, emphasizing the importance of sustained community rehabilitation to prevent recidivism. Whilst this court appreciates the broader context, such representations must be viewed through the lens of individual responsibility and public protection imperatives.  

In evaluating psychological reports related to this case, I have carefully reviewed the comprehensive assessment conducted by Dr Amina Feng, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, dated 15 March 2025. Dr Feng’s evaluation encompassed in-depth analysis of your mental health, cognitive functioning, and social circumstances. Her report concludes that while you do not meet diagnostic criteria for major psychiatric disorders, there is evidence of moderate impulsivity traits and historically untreated mild depressive symptoms exacerbated by social isolation and unstable housing. It is noteworthy that Dr Feng recommended engagement with community mental health services and cognitive behavioural therapy to address these areas. However, the record indicates sporadic attendance and limited uptake of such provisions.  

It may be instructive here to reflect on the decision in R v. Clemons [2022] EWCA Crim 738, which dealt with an offender exhibiting borderline personality disorder and a history of arson-related offences. Although those facts bear no immediate resemblance to the present case, Clemons emphasises the necessity of balancing therapeutic intervention opportunities with the imperative of containment and public safety in sentencing considerations. The presence of mental health concerns, even where clinically significant, does not preclude custodial sentencing where warranted by the nature of the offending and risk posed.  

It is essential at this juncture to note that the defendant's background includes no known involvement with organised criminal networks or links to drug trafficking. Unlike some previous cases cited in court – such as R v. Shore [2018] EWCA Crim 1642, involving offences connected to large-scale Class A drug importation concealed within modified vehicles operating through the Port of Felixstowe – your conduct appears to be entirely disconnected from such organised activity. Despite this, the cumulative effect of persistent retail crime should not be underestimated as it places operational strains upon policing priorities and impacts community safety perceptions.  

Moreover, the court notes correspondence from the Norfolk Probation Service indicating staff shortages and increasing caseloads, particularly in the area’s mental health and acquisitive offending teams. While these systemic pressures are unlikely to feature in decision-making at the individual sentencing level, they provide a real and sobering backdrop to rehabilitation prospects and service availability.  

Public order has been similarly affected by an upsurge in low-level antisocial behaviour, including unauthorized graffiti tagging on city transport infrastructure and the repeated theft of copper cabling from railway depots near Wymondham over the past 12 months. These are, nonetheless, distinct from your offending trajectory but indicative of wider challenges facing local authorities and law enforcement.  

The court also wishes to acknowledge the professionalism and resilience of court clerks and ushers at this venue who have maintained effective operation despite the impact of recent industrial disputes, the resultant backlog in case listings, and technical disruptions affecting court recording systems. Their contribution, whilst unremarked in open proceedings, represents a vital pillar of our justice system’s functioning.  

Turning to the facts of your offending behaviour, as is standard, this court sets out the material underlying your conviction, mindful that the particulars are to be considered in full at sentencing.

Subsequent analysis of incident reports, security footage, and witness accounts reveals a consistent modus operandi characterised by deliberate selection of high-demand items, including over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and personal care products, frequently employing distraction and concealment tactics designed to evade detection by staff and security systems.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

In at least three separate instances, you took advantage of periods where store personnel were engaged by customer influx or restocking duties, thus reducing the effectiveness of immediate surveillance. These episodes suggest calculated planning rather than impulsive lapse.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Notably, the use of distinctive clothing items—identified in multiple CCTV recordings as repeated apparel—facilitated the mapping of your movements across different premises, strengthening the evidential case for course of conduct offences rather than isolated events.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Several employees have provided victim impact statements, describing the consequent distress caused by your repeated visits and the heightened security measures compelled thereby, including the locking of cabinets and alteration of work practices to avoid lone shifts. Such indirect consequences, while not involving personal assault, nonetheless contribute significantly to the overall harm.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The court notes particularly the adverse effect upon smaller, independent retailers, many operating on the margins of economic viability, who report decreased footfall, reputational damage, and additional insurance premiums attributable in part to persistent shoplifting risk.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Your prior criminal record includes two earlier convictions for similar offences, with the most recent dating back to 2021. Despite warnings and community resolution opportunities extended at that time, there has been no demonstrable behavioural change.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Moreover, on occasions you have declined offers of assistance from local outreach programmes designed to help individuals with financial difficulties or substance misuse issues—supports available but evidently unaccessed or insufficiently engaged.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Your defence submissions, made through counsel, have highlighted numerous socio-economic factors purportedly mitigating your conduct, including unstable housing situations documented in social services records and episodic unemployment. While those contextual factors are recognised, the court must balance them against the persistence, premeditation, and cumulative impact of the offences.  

Sentencing Framework and Considerations  
In determining an appropriate sentence, the court is guided principally by the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, which emphasises the significance of harm caused, culpability, and the presence or absence of aggravating or mitigating factors. The guideline identifies repeat offences, targeting of vulnerable premises, and impact on victim confidence as key aggravating factors in cases such as this.  

While a custodial sentence cannot be ruled out where seriousness demands, the court is simultaneously mindful of the importance of proportionate response and potential for rehabilitation within the community. The probation service will prepare a detailed pre-sentence report, addressing your risk of reoffending, suitability for structured interventions – including cognitive behavioural therapy tailored to acquisitive offending – and the feasibility of community sentencing frameworks equipped to address underlying vulnerabilities.  

It is worth observing that in cases involving acquisitive offending, sentencing options increasingly include combinations of unpaid work requirements, attendance at accredited programmes, and mandatory supervision conditions. These integrated approaches seek to reduce future offending risks while delivering tangible community benefits.  

I must stress, however, that such measures require acceptance and active participation on your part; a pattern of disengagement or breach would ordinarily invite escalation to more restrictive sanctions.  

The court notes with regret an ongoing predicament confronting the Legal Aid Agency, whose protracted vetting procedures for approval of expert reports and counsel instructions continue to delay timely progression of cases. This systemic issue exacerbates inequalities and impairs effective defence representation, as has been the experience here, where approval for commissioning an independent psychiatric evaluation was delayed over several months despite early application. The court encourages administrative reform to circumvent such avoidable impediments going forward.  

No doubt similar frustrations are shared by the frontline police officers and community support workers, whose time is increasingly stretched by the volume of “low harm” but high occurrence offences such as those you have committed. This phenomenon contributes to a phenomenon sometimes described as a “triage effect,” whereby limited resources are disproportionately consumed by frequent offenders to the detriment of more serious and emergent public safety threats.  

Your case serves as a microcosm of this broader challenge facing modern policing and community safety management.  

Before concluding, the court records the diligent efforts of retail loss prevention staff and the patience of store employees whose testimony and cooperation have been invaluable to the administration of justice in this matter. While the absence of high-profile violence or spectacular criminal schemes might entice some to dismiss the gravity of repeated shoplifting, the cumulative toll on victim wellbeing, business sustainability, and public confidence is far from insubstantial.
