IN THE CROWN COURT AT DUNBRIDGE  
R v. MR. H  
Case No. D2025/07316  
Sentencing Remarks – Recorder J. W. Montgomery  
Filed: 15 August 2025  

Mr. H, you stand before this court for sentencing in relation to charges brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically concerning an indictment alleging multiple incidents of shoplifting over an extended period throughout 2024 and into early 2025. The offences occurred within various retail premises across the Dunbridge metropolitan area, including both independently operated shops and branches of regional chains.

Procedural Background and Context  
Your case was initially brought before the Magistrates’ Court in Dunbridge on 4 March 2025. Following your initial appearance and the presentation of the prosecution’s evidence, it was determined that the complexity and seriousness of the case warranted allocation to the Crown Court under the Better Case Management scheme. The transition to the Crown Court was effected on 20 March 2025, with subsequent preparation hearings held on 6 May and 18 June.

The prosecution’s file has been both extensive and detailed, comprising over two hundred pages of disclosure documents, including CCTV footage, witness statements, police officer logs, and expert forensic reports relating to recovered merchandise and clothing fibres. It is notable that, regrettably, despite the simplest expectation that cases of this nature might proceed swiftly, your proceedings were marked by several adjournments, some occasioned by difficulties in securing the attendance of key witnesses and others arising from the defence’s application for additional evidential disclosure and an expert psychiatric report. The latter necessitated liaison between the Legal Aid Agency and instructed practitioners, resulting in a delay of over six weeks before permission to obtain the report was granted.

It cannot be overlooked that the Legal Aid Agency’s processing delays had a material impact on the overall timeline of these proceedings. This phenomenon is neither isolated nor novel but rather a recurring issue that frequently impinges on the right to a fair and timely hearing. Bureaucratic inefficiency in legal aid provision not only hampers case progression but also imposes additional strain on all parties involved—the defence, prosecution, witnesses, and ultimately the court itself. I note this with considerable professional disappointment.

Within the wider criminal justice context, this case must be viewed against a backdrop of increasing pressure on police investigative resources, particularly within property crime units responsible for acquisitive offences. The Dunbridge Police Service’s Retail Crime Task Force has, over the past year, reported a 12% increase in incidents of shoplifting, a trend mirrored nationally. Officers tasked with the preliminary inquiries, evidence gathering, and suspect apprehension in cases such as yours often operate within capacity constraints, facing competing priorities including serious violent crime, drug trafficking investigations, and cybercrime threats. The extended deployment of duty officers to conduct surveillance and evidence collection on retail theft, while appropriate in the circumstances, is not without opportunity cost, displacing attention from arguably higher risk threats.

In addition to operational considerations, it is prudent to acknowledge the financial impact of shoplifting on affected businesses. Retailers within the Dunbridge area have expressed concerns regarding the cumulative effect of persistent thefts on profit margins, staff welfare, and customer experience. While some losses may appear minor when considered in isolation, the aggregation of such incidents has been cited as a contributory factor to recent store closures within economically fragile neighbourhoods, further exacerbating local deprivation. The court is mindful, however, that the purposes of these sentencing remarks are not to administer sociology but to impose proportionate and just consequences within the framework of criminal law.

In the course of these proceedings, I have received and carefully considered a variety of reports. Of particular import is the psychiatric assessment conducted by Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Leonard Briggs, dated 14 July 2025. The report provides a detailed clinical evaluation of yourself, assessing your mental health status, risk factors, and capacity for rehabilitation. Dr. Briggs notes the presence of {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}. While no evidence of severe or enduring mental disorder was identified, the report highlights significant markers of impulsivity and possible co-morbid substance misuse. The clinical observations were supplemented by contemporaneous records from your primary care physician, which identify historical attendance for treatment of anxiety but no formal diagnosis of a psychotic or mood disorder.

By way of further context, it is significant to remark upon the enduring challenges faced by psychiatric and mental health services in the region. Waiting lists for adult psychological therapies have lengthened markedly, with some patients experiencing delays exceeding six months before initial consultation. The court is conscious that these systemic pressures pose additional barriers to the prompt and effective intervention for individuals vulnerable to recidivist offending. Nonetheless, the public interest in timely rehabilitation and offence reduction remains paramount.

Turning then to a review of the legal principles applicable in your case, it is appropriate to reference the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline, issued in 2019, which remains the authoritative framework for sentencing in offences of this nature. The guideline mandates consideration of the culpability of the offender, the harm caused, and any aggravating or mitigating features. The guideline underscores the importance of proportionate sentencing, balancing appropriate punishment with opportunities for rehabilitation.

I draw attention also to pertinent appellate authorities, including R v. Gillingham [2020] EWCA Crim 1234, wherein the Court reaffirmed the necessity of tailoring sentences to reflect not only the objective severity of the offence but the subjective circumstances of the defendant. Equally, consideration must be given to the case of R v. Clarke [2022] EWCA Crim 876, where the Court addressed the impact of late guilty pleas in procedural economy and sentencing credit. It was held that a plea entered shortly before trial, while reducing the highest sentence thresholds, should attract limited discount reflecting the burden placed on victims, witnesses, and court time.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

It bears noting that the facts of Gillingham involved a defendant convicted of aggravated burglary during which serious injury was caused to a resident; a fact pattern substantially dissimilar to the present matter. Nonetheless, its reaffirmation of sentencing discretion and proportionality principles has enduring relevance.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

A notable illustration of the sentencing principles pertaining to mental health is found in R v. Townsend [2018] EWCA Crim 2251. That case involved an arson conviction in which the defendant, suffering from schizophrenia, caused extensive damage to a block of flats. The Court of Appeal emphasised the dual objectives of punishment and therapeutic intervention, highlighting that while mental illness may mitigate culpability to some degree, it does not nullify responsibility, especially where public safety is at risk.

Another case often cited is R v. Browne [2019] EWCA Crim 1557, involving possession of a bladed article in a school environment. The defendant’s pre-existing difficulties with substance misuse were considered but did not negate the aggravating nature of the offence, resulting in an immediate custodial sentence. Though dissimilar in offense type, the principles of balancing mitigating factors against community protection obligations are consistent across criminal law.

Returning to facts more directly relevant to acquisitive crime, the case of R v. Farnsworth [2023] EWCA Crim 1417 warrants consideration. In Farnsworth, the defendant engaged in a series of shoplifting offences involving deception and use of an organised distraction technique, resulting in a significant cumulative value of stolen goods. The Court stressed the importance of deterrence in retail theft, particularly where the offending is protracted and deliberate, affirming a custodial disposition on appeal despite pleas advanced in mitigation.

Observations from the probation service, contained in a pre-sentence report compiled by Officer Sarah Jameson, dated 7 August 2025, provide further insight. The report confirms your limited engagement with previous community disposal schemes and notes a history of frequent changes in accommodation, contributing to your social instability. It also mentions, however, that you have demonstrated some willingness to attend addiction support groups, albeit irregularly. Officer Jameson highlights the risk of further offending if unresolved financial and psychological needs remain unaddressed.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

While the risk factors detailed are concerning, the report cautiously suggests potential benefit from a community sentence incorporating rehabilitation and activity requirements focused on cognitive behavioural therapy and substance misuse treatment.

The court has also received letters from local charities, including the Dunbridge Outreach Network and SafeSpace, both of which commend the efforts of their staff to engage you in supportive services. Their correspondence emphasises the challenges posed by chronic homelessness and substance dependency in the community, and notes a growing trend in repeat shoplifting offences among vulnerable individuals. Such partnerships remain invaluable but are, regrettably, stretched thin by increasing demand and limited funding.

Further complicating the public protection landscape is the phenomenon of so-called “cuckooing,” whereby offenders or associates leverage the accommodation of vulnerable persons for the purposes of criminal activity. While there is no finding of such conduct directly linked to you, the court is obliged to note these patterns given their pervasiveness.

It should also be acknowledged that some co-defendants or associates involved in related retail theft investigations at the time have faced charges on unrelated matters, ranging from benefit fraud to public order offences. One individual implicated alongside you, but not tried here, remains at large following failure to attend court, presenting ongoing enforcement challenges for law enforcement.

Mention must be made of the strain on police resources following a recent arson attack at Court 5 within this building, which impacted the availability of staff and necessitated relocation of certain hearings, including one scheduled for your matter. Additionally, an incident involving the late arrival of court interpreters on 12 July 2025 caused delay and disruption, frustrating case progression.

The need for multi-agency cooperation in managing cases such as yours cannot be overstated. Liaison with the Dunbridge Social Services Directorate, Adult Mental Health Teams, and housing providers is underway to facilitate a coordinated response. Nonetheless, persistent staffing shortages in probation services — intensified by national recruitment challenges and the demands of Covid-19 pandemic aftermath — mean that personalised supervision and intervention options remain constrained.

It is also notable that the National Business Crime Reduction Audit of 2024 highlighted a rise in shoplifting-related incidents involving organised groups using distraction and concealment techniques. While the data does not attribute such methods to you, awareness of these trends informs the court’s assessment.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

The social context of acquisitive crime is complex. Amid rising living costs, shrinking welfare support, and the deteriorating availability of affordable housing, the temptation to offend for basic necessities has increased. Yet, as repeatedly emphasised in judicial discourse, social explanation does not equate to exoneration.

The victim impact statements submitted by affected retailers chronicle the practical and psychological insecurity engendered by your repeated offending. Employees report heightened anxiety, reduced morale, and in some cases altered working patterns to avoid lone shifts.

The court must balance the individual circumstances with broader societal interests: deterring offending, protecting the public, and promoting rehabilitation where feasible.

I now turn to consider mitigation.

Your counsel has relied on your expressed remorse, your cooperation since arrest, and your commitments to avoid a return to criminal conduct. Your previous good character was noted, including a period of sustained lawful behaviour between 2016 and 2019, although recent years saw a regrettable decline.

Reference was also made to the impact of your unstable housing and purported substance dependency, factors which purportedly limit your ability to comply with conventional community orders. Furthermore, it was submitted that a custodial sentence would likely exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, including potential disengagement from treatment services.

I acknowledge these submissions. They are reflected in the available reports, which genuinely indicate elements of vulnerability.

Notwithstanding, the persistence and deliberate nature of the offending, combined with prior convictions, indicate a serious pattern requiring a firm response.

The late entry of your guilty plea, just days before trial, further limits the discount that this court is prepared to grant, in line with established case law from R v. Clarke and other authorities cited above.

Sentencing Options and Parliament’s Intent  
The court is mindful of Parliament’s guidance, as articulated in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, regarding the imposition of community orders versus custodial sentences. The threshold for immediate custody revolves around culpability and harm, remedial potential, and public protection.

Regarding community sentences, the Sentencing Council recommends conditions tailored to address offending behaviour, such as in your case rehabilitation activity requirements and unpaid work, designed to contribute to both deterrence and constructive reformation.

The court retains discretion to impose an immediate custodial term where it is deemed necessary, especially where prior alternatives have failed to prevent further offending.

Prior to determining the appropriate disposition in your case, the court will await the forthcoming pre-sentence report, which has been requested to include detailed assessments on your housing situation, mental health treatment engagement, and the feasibility of community-based interventions.

In the meantime, the court records its appreciation for the diligent work of all involved, including the prosecuting counsel Ms. Natasha Reed and defence counsel Mr. Oliver Finch, both of whom have conducted themselves with professionalism throughout.

The courtroom staff and ushers are acknowledged for their composure and efficiency, maintaining
