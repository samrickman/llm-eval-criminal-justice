IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/00347  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge I. F. Grayson  
Filed: 14 August 2026  

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentencing in relation to a charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The court has been apprised that the offences for which you have been convicted reflect a sustained episode of dishonesty carried out over the course of several months during the calendar years 2025 to early 2026, principally within the city bounds of Brighton and some nearby retail centres forming part of the Sussex coastal conurbation.  

Procedural History and Listing Notes  
Your case came into this court following your arrest on 12 February 2026 under the supervision of officers attached to the Sussex Police Retail Crime Unit. The multi-agency investigation was prompted by complaints from retail premises involved in the Brighton Business Crime Partnership, a community safety initiative designed to facilitate collaborative response to recurring patterns of theft and other acquisitive offences. After several reports of missing stock and observed suspicious conduct that followed a distinctive pattern, your identity was uncovered through detailed analysis of CCTV footage and subsequent field enquiries.  
The framework under which this case has progressed is that of Better Case Management (BCM). Implemented nationally in 2019 with the objective of ensuring prompt and efficient resolution of criminal matters, BCM requires early and sustained case progression, with appropriate engagement with both prosecution and defence representatives. Notably, the scheduling of hearings in this instance suffered a modest delay consequent upon the well-publicised nationwide strike action undertaken by the Court Staff Union during April and May 2026. This industrial action disrupted normal listing arrangements, necessitating the adjournment of your initial plea hearing from the originally proposed date of 27 March to 5 May 2026. Such organisational challenges are regrettable, yet they serve to illustrate the systemic pressures currently affecting the judiciary and allied services.  
Furthermore, your case was subject to additional delay arising from the need to secure Legal Aid funding for instructing a forensic psychologist with expertise in repeat acquisitive offending. This application, made on 12 April, encountered protracted administrative hurdles, with funding only approved on 20 June 2026 after several rounds of correspondence between your legal representatives and the Legal Aid Agency. These procedural obstacles are emblematic of wider, well-documented issues within the legal aid system. As has been reported in the Judicial Review of 2025 (The Justice Gap v Legal Aid Agency), systemic underfunding and bureaucratic complexity have contributed to considerable inefficiencies, adversely affecting the timely administration of justice. I share the concerns expressed in that case and record them here in the interests of transparency.  
Following the granting of authorisation, the psychiatric report was commissioned and provided to the court on 6 August 2026, enabling today’s sentencing hearing to proceed. I extend thanks to all involved in expediting this report despite the constrained resources presently faced by forensic and clinical psychology services nationally.  
The hearing today has been convened in open court, with attendance by all parties. I record my thanks to Ms Christine Dalloway, appearing for the Crown, and Mr Simon Oakley, representing the defence pursuant to the Legal Aid representation order.  

Wider Context and Public Service Observations  
Before addressing the facts of the offending, it is customary and appropriate to offer some contextual observations. While the court recognises that its primary remit is confined to adjudication on individual cases, it cannot ignore the broader societal and institutional environment in which such offending occurs. We find ourselves, regrettably, in an era characterised by a notable increase in the incidence of acquisitive crime targeting retail premises. This phenomenon is compounded by pressures on policing resources, challenges within social welfare provision, and a persistent shortage of affordable housing in many urban centres. All these factors combine in a complex web of causation that defies simplistic explanation or facile solutions.  
For instance, the Sussex Business Crime Partnership, under whose aegis your case was investigated, is but one example of an initiative dependent on funding that has seen significant cuts over the past half-decade. These schemes rely heavily on understaffed officers who balance the demands of frontline policing with administrative duties that are as taxing as they are necessary. Moreover, the voluntary sector entities that support vulnerable populations who might otherwise become involved in offending—such as the Brighton Outreach Network—are themselves operating under severe strain. These pressures can contribute to service gaps, which unwelcome though they may be, are an unfortunate reality. The court respects and acknowledges the work of those dedicated professionals and volunteers in these sectors, who labour often without public recognition.  
Conversely, the court must also express concern regarding the operational efficacy of certain state services. The Legal Aid Agency’s undue latency in approving funding applications, as encountered here, is a troublingly recurrent theme. Such procedural bottlenecks not only prolong the resolution of cases but heighten the pressures on defendants, witnesses, and legal teams alike. To treat timely and effective legal representation as a discretionary grant undermines the core principles of justice. This court urges consideration be given by relevant authorities to overhaul bureaucratic practices that presently act as impediments rather than facilitators of due process.

References to Case Law and Legal Principles  
Turning to legal matters, the principles guiding sentencing for offences under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remain well-established. The Theft Act, enacted in 1968, provides that theft is the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner thereof. The seriousness of shoplifting offences must be gauged not solely by the value of the goods taken but also by the circumstances, the impact on victims, and the conduct of the offender. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, first published in 2016 and updated as recently as 2024, is instructive. It highlights aggravating factors such as targeting vulnerable victims, repeat offending, concealment techniques, and disruption to business.  
In the present context, the court also acknowledges relevant appellate authority. In R v. Templeton [2022] EWCA Crim 965, the Court of Appeal considered a case involving organized group theft from multiple supermarkets, with particular emphasis on the calculated and systematic nature of the offending. The judgment underscored that repeated offending demonstrating clear awareness of surveillance and prior warnings justifies a firm custodial approach. Although your case differs in scale and organisational complexity from Templeton, the principles remain pertinent.  
A further instructive case is R v. Benavi [2018] EWCA Crim 571, wherein the defendant was convicted of multiple counts relating to credit card fraud and shop theft. The Court of Appeal emphasized the importance of recognising cumulative harm, particularly psychological distress to staff and the broader economic consequences. Again, while not factually identical, Benavi sets a benchmark for considering non-monetary impact in theft offences.  
Additionally, while the facts before this court do not involve violence, I note the observations in R v. Greaves [2021] EWCA Crim 1230 concerning the increased culpability attributed to offenders whose conduct acted to diminish staff morale or provoke fear. Greaves affirmed that repeated targeting—especially of small independent retailers—can disrupt community cohesion and warrant enhanced sentences.  
In passing, I draw attention to R v. McConnell [2019] EWCA Crim 1447, a case involving graffiti and criminal damage to public transport infrastructure. The court there highlighted that seemingly minor offences, when committed persistently, may reflect a destructive disregard that erodes public spaces and community trust. This is peripheral to the current matter but situates the current offending within a wider tapestry of social harm.  

Facts of the Offending  
The facts of the case are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

Analysis of the evidence, including video surveillance reviewed by the Crown, indicates that you engaged in repeated thefts involving items primarily in the personal care and convenience food categories. Techniques observed include use of inconspicuous bagging, distraction of staff by feigned phone calls, and deliberate timing around staff breaks.  
Notwithstanding that the financial value of individual incidents is relatively low, the persistence and planning evident elevate the conduct beyond what might be regarded as opportunistic. This court notes that at no point was violence or intimidation employed, but the cumulative effect on retail staff—the victims in this case—has been one of understandable anxiety and a diminished sense of workplace security.  
Moreover:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

This pattern suggests both premeditation and a willingness to exploit weaknesses in store procedures and staffing levels. As noted in victim impact statements incorporated within the prosecution file, the effect on employee morale has included requests for additional security measures, altered staffing schedules, and calls for management to consider staff rotation policies to mitigate personal risk.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

The persistent nature of the offending is underlined by the Crown’s evidence that your conduct continued despite warnings and informal interventions initiated by local policing teams and store management. These included community resolutions and invitations to participate in diversionary schemes that you ultimately declined to engage with meaningfully.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

The distress caused to your principal victims cannot be underestimated, although I acknowledge that there was no physical harm or threats of violence. Still, the court is satisfied that your conduct had a wider impact on the local retail community, contributing to reduced customer confidence and increased operational costs.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

In terms of prior history, the prosecution has provided details of previous convictions for similar offences, some dating back more than five years but nonetheless indicative of a pattern of conduct that has persisted despite prior interventions. The present offending, culminating in conviction, represents a breach of the high trust that shopkeepers and their staff place in members of the public.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

Finally, despite the efforts of liaison officers and social workers to offer support services, including financial advice and substance misuse counselling, you have reportedly declined these offers, undermining the prospect of rehabilitation outside of custody.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

Psychiatric and Pre-Sentence Assessments  
Your case prompted referral to Dr Fiona Markham, consultant forensic clinical psychologist, who provided a detailed report dated 5 August 2026. Dr Markham’s conclusions are nuanced: while no formal diagnosis of serious mental illness is present, there are noted traits of emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and low resilience when confronted with socio-economic pressures. The report highlights tendencies toward avoidant coping mechanisms and inconsistent engagement with voluntary support services.  
Parallel to the clinical evaluation, a probation report was compiled, underscoring medium risk of reoffending in the absence of meaningful intervention and noting a degree of ambivalence towards rehabilitation efforts. The probation officer’s observations include concerns over your unstable accommodation status and sporadic employment history.  
These assessments serve to inform but not to circumscribe the sentencing outcome, which must balance personal circumstances with public protection and deterrence imperatives.   

Additional Observations on Procedural and Institutional Matters  
It is pertinent to remark that the allocation of cases to Crown Court sittings continues to face intense demand. As noted in the Ministry of Justice’s 2026 Annual Report, delays in criminal proceeding timetabling have increased by 14% over the previous year, attributable chiefly to a shortfall of circuit judges and administrative staff. Such systemic constraints inevitably impact on cases such as yours, where timely disposition is in the interest of all parties.  
Moreover, recent refurbishment of Courtroom 5, where this hearing takes place, has aimed to improve accessibility and technology integration, enhancing video link capacity for witness testimony. These investments, while welcome, represent but incremental ameliorations in a broader environment of resource scarcity.  
I take this opportunity to commend the court ushers and legal clerks assigned to today’s listing, whose professionalism ensures that proceedings maintain the dignity and order essential to the administration of justice.  

Ancillary Case Law Not Directly Related but of Occasional Jurisprudential Interest  
While not specifically relevant to your offence or personal circumstances, the court is mindful of the jurisprudence in cases such as R v. Collins [2021] EWCA Crim 1782 concerning possession of offensive weapons in a school car park. Although violent crime is categorically distinct from theft, Collins reinforces the principle that location and setting contribute significantly to sentencing severity. Similarly, the 2019 case of R v. Fletcher [2019] EWCA Crim 904 dealt with affray in a public house related to a brawl involving pool cues.  
These examples serve no direct bearing but illustrate the wider canvas of criminal law which situates offences in context.  
Of note, the Court of Appeal has recently remarked upon the challenges of sentencing multiple offenders where co-defendants’ actions diverge sharply in scope or culpability. I mention in passing that your co-defendant, Mr R, currently remains at large, his case paused pending extradition proceedings unrelated to the matters before this court.  
Such cross-currents in co-defendant proceedings further complicate the justice process, particularly in multi-jurisdictional investigations.  

Concluding Remarks on Sentencing Approach and Next Steps  
Having considered the antecedent, the facts established, the manifest impact on victims and the community, as well as the pre-sentence and psychiatric assessments, I am satisfied that this case demands a carefully calibrated, proportionate response. The law permits, and indeed requires, a sentencing outcome that reflects the seriousness of sustained, repeated theft whilst acknowledging personal circumstances that might mitigate culpability to a degree.  
The court expressly notes your expression of remorse, albeit belated, as conveyed in written submissions to my clerk. While not overriding other factors, genuine contrition is to be welcomed. Conversely, the pattern of repeated offending, coupled with limited engagement with statutory and third sector support, militates against undue leniency.  
Given the complexities herein and the recent receipt of the psychological report, the court considers it appropriate to defer final sentencing to permit a full and fresh pre-sentence report, focusing on your risk of reoffending, amenability to intervention, and the feasibility of tailored community-based disposals. The probation service is requested to give detailed consideration to specialist programmes, such as the Brighton Cognitive Behavioural Intervention for Acquisitive Offenders (BCBIO), alongside economic and housing support pathways.  
I emphasise the imperative that all parties cooperate fully to expedite the conclusion of this matter and that you, Mr H, engage constructively with probation and other agencies as directed. Such engagement will positively inform the court's final determination.  
The court furthermore advises that a deferred sentencing date has been provisionally fixed for 16 October 2026. This will allow adequate time for preparation and consideration of any fresh reports or letters of mitigation.  
I must remind you that any application to adduce further evidence for sentence should be made promptly to avoid further delays.  
Finally, I thank Ms Dalloway and Mr Oakley for their submissions and professional conduct throughout proceedings.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 August 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction will be forwarded to the relevant authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
