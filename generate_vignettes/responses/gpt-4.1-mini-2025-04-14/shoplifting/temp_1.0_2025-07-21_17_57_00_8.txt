IN THE CROWN COURT AT BELMONT  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. T2025/13567  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. Jamieson  
Filed: 12 August 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence in respect of offences involving shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans a considerable period, stretching from late 2023 through to early 2025, and comprises a series of thefts principally committed in the retail districts of Belmont and its immediate environs.

Procedural History and Case Management  
Your arrest occurred on 18 February 2025 following an extensive, multi-agency investigation coordinated principally by the Belmont Local Policing Unit, in conjunction with the District Retail Crime Partnership and supported by the Belmont Council’s dedicated CCTV operations centre. This inquiry was sparked by a series of incidents flagged by shop owners and security staff, which when viewed in aggregate suggested a recurring and purposeful pattern of conduct. Initial reports were treated discretely and regarded as isolated events by front-line officers, however, once patterns emerged — via case linkage and behavioural analysis — efforts culminated in your identification and apprehension nearly two years later.

The procedural journey from charge to plea has been lengthy, reflective of a broader pattern observed in these matters, where investigations into persistent acquisitive offending impose significant burdens on limited public resources. It is worth noting that the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR) provisions governing Better Case Management (BCM) were applied in this context, facilitating a structured pathway for early case preparation and disclosure. The preparatory hearings occurred on 5 April and 19 May 2025 and were held without undue delay. It is, however, regrettable that certain administrative delays — notably those pertaining to Legal Aid authorisations for expert instruction — contributed cumulatively to procedural extensions, as has become all too common in today's criminal justice system.

The BCM process is designed to promote clarity and efficiency, to encourage early pleas where appropriate, and to enable the Courts to allocate resources judiciously. I am, however, compelled to record the persistent frustration of the Court with the Legal Aid Agency’s performance in this matter. Repeated delays and opaque decision-making have in no small measure impeded the timely progression of proceedings, despite the uncontroversial nature of expert evidence sought. Such administrative inertia runs counter to the principles of expedition and fairness enshrined in the CPR and sows increasing scepticism among practitioners and lay observers alike.

It bears also recording the commendable efforts of the Belmont Retail Partnership and the local Safer Neighbourhood Team, who have marshalled victim impact statements, store-level security assessments, and coordinated with health and community welfare charities to provide a holistic evidential framework. Their work, though under-resourced, contributes materially to the administration of justice and merits acknowledgment.

We find ourselves, unmistakably, in an era characterised by a gradual but inexorable increase in acquisitive offences, many of which appear petty but cumulatively give rise to significant social and economic costs. Reports from national policing bodies such as the National Retail Crime Intelligence Organisation reveal that offences of this kind disproportionately affect small-to-medium enterprises and independent outlets — those with limited capacity to absorb losses or invest in protective infrastructure. The visible presence of repeat offenders contributes to a climate of fear and disillusionment among retail workers, a workforce already grappling with wage stagnation, insecure contracts, and rising living costs.

It must be emphasised, however, that the court’s focus is the individual before us, the particulars of their offending, and the appropriate sanction to reflect culpability and protect the public. Wider socio-economic trends, though relevant to context, cannot distract from principles of personal responsibility.

At this point, I wish to stress that the current case—despite dealing with theft of goods generally considered low in individual value—cannot be treated lightly. Precedent long establishes that the cumulative impact of repeated thefts, especially those involving sustained courses of conduct, necessitates proportionate responses.

By way of reference, in R v. Darwell [2020] EWCA Crim 1658, the Court of Appeal underscored that where multiple offences, though individually minor, form part of a calculated and continuing pattern, the aggregate seriousness warrants sentencing relevant to the full scope of the offending. In that matter, the defendant's multiple shoplifting incidents over a two-year period resulted in a 15-month custodial sentence, reflecting both deterrent and rehabilitative considerations.

I also take note of the authorities concerning credit for guilty pleas. As established in R v. Compston [2021] EWCA Crim 1172, the timing of the plea is a pivotal consideration. A plea entered at the earliest realistic opportunity earns greater discount; conversely, delayed pleas, particularly those entered at trial or at the very last moment, merit more limited consideration.

The court also recognizes the provision of victim personal statements and impact reports, submitted by various retailers, which describe the cumulative emotional strain, increased costs of security, and operational disruptions occasioned by the offending. It is a frequent misconception that theft from businesses is somehow victimless. In reality, such offences reverberate through supply chains, affect pricing, and induce anxiety among employees.

For context, it is worth recalling the development and rationale of modern sentencing guidelines for theft offences, which reflect a nuanced balancing of culpability, harm, and offender circumstances. The Sentencing Council’s 2016 guideline on theft emphasises that the presence of premeditation, targeting of vulnerable victims, use of deception or concealment techniques, and prior convictions invariably elevate seriousness.

Of note too is the observation in R v. Handforth [2019] EWCA Crim 948, where persistent shoplifting directed at small community pharmacies was found to exacerbate public harm given the essential nature of certain products and the vulnerability of staff who often face verbal abuse and intimidation.

The issue of sentencing options arose during initial hearings, with the defence seeking to explore community-based disposals, including referral to rehabilitative programmes. Correspondence detailing these proposals was exchanged in May and June 2025, but the protracted nature of the case has limited early intervention.

It is prudent here to reflect briefly on the operational challenges faced by the probation services and rehabilitation agencies in cases of this nature. With staffing levels stretched and caseloads rising, the capacity to deliver nuanced, individually tailored interventions has diminished. Waiting lists for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programmes and accredited offending behaviour courses have lengthened, often stretching beyond three months. The question of how best to integrate support for underlying causes—be it substance misuse, financial hardship, or mental health difficulties—remains a pressing challenge.

In the present case, the probation service’s initial pre-sentence questionnaire highlighted concerns regarding engagement patterns and prior non-compliance, though full assessment awaits comprehensive report submission.

Contained within the papers before the court is a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Farah Knowles, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who conducted a clinical interview and examination of relevant records in late July 2025. Dr Knowles’ report is detailed and professionally prepared, outlining the absence of any major mental disorder but noting a personality style characterised by impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and elements of antisocial traits. The report emphasises that while
