IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTFORD  
R v. MR H  
Case No. H2025/04129  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. R. FENTON  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of an offence of theft, specifically shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct charged and proved by your plea relates to a series of actions occurring intermittently over a period of approximately sixteen months across retail outlets in the Hartford and adjacent boroughs. This court approaches the determination of sentence mindful of the multiplicity of factors both legal and factual which inform this judiciary’s exercise of discretion, having regard at all times to the overriding purpose of sentencing: the punishment of offenders, the reduction of crime (including by deterrence), reform and rehabilitation of offenders, protection of the public, and the making of reparation to victims or the community.

Procedural History and Context  
You were first arrested on 15 July 2025 by officers from the Hartford Metropolitan Police Service following a coordinated investigative effort involving the Retail Crime Reduction Unit, working in conjunction with the local Business Crime Partnership and several private security providers across the area. The investigation was triggered by a pattern of incidents reported by multiple high street and independent retailers, where loss prevention teams had identified repeated instances of stolen goods correlating with the description and behaviours later ascribed to you.

The investigation was notable for its multi-agency dimension, incorporating input not only from law enforcement but also representatives of the Hartford Council Trading Standards Department, the regional Probation Service, and a consortium of private crime analysts specialising in behavioural profiling for acquisitive crimes. This cooperation exemplifies the evolving nature of retail crime management in the 21st century, requiring both the pooling of intelligence and the harmonisation of efforts across the public, private, and voluntary sectors.

The matter was allocated to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) arrangements following your initial court appearance at the magistrates’ court on 21 July 2025. The case has proceeded in accordance with the indicative timetables prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Rules, notwithstanding some delay attributable to the necessity of securing legal aid authorisation to instruct a forensic psychiatric assessment, an issue to which I shall return in due course.

It is worth recording that the Legal Aid Agency’s performance in this regard was, regrettably, as problematic as in many recent matters involving expert evidence. Your instructing solicitors’ application for funding to engage an independent forensic psychologist was not approved until 28 August 2025 — over a month after being first submitted — despite multiple reminders and clarifications concerning the necessity for such assessment. This delay served to extend the overall case timeline considerably, increasing the strain imposed not only on the court but also on prosecution and defence alike.

I would like also to acknowledge the work of the probation officer, Ms Elisabet Reyes, who has prepared a comprehensive pre-sentence interview report and has liaised extensively with community support agencies to assist in the compilation of background materials relevant to your case. Ms Reyes’ dedication is admirable in a context of increasing workload and diminishing resources.

It is also appropriate to acknowledge the contribution of the Hartford Shopkeepers’ Association, who have demonstrated considerable patience in enabling victim impact statements and supporting the process through facilitation and coordination of retailer reports.

The evidential base relied upon the collation of multiple CCTV recordings, detailed witness statements, and forensic examination of items recovered in your possession at the time of arrest. Hence the prosecution case was robust and well-assembled.

Among the authorities guiding sentencing in theft matters is R v. Burnett [2018] EWCA Crim 1235 which stressed the importance of considering both the value of stolen goods and the manner in which theft was committed, including any element of planning or concealment. It is accepted that you operated a methodical approach, taking advantage of staff distraction and employing concealment strategies which evidence a degree of premeditation.

Furthermore, in R v. Darby [2020] EWCA Crim 2145, the Court of Appeal underscored the aggravating nature of offending that affects vulnerable retail staff, particularly those in single-person stores or outlets where heightened anxiety or fear is engendered. While your conduct did not involve violence or threats, it resulted in palpable psychological impact on employees, a factor which the sentencing guideline appropriately acknowledges.

Such considerations are tempered by R v. Mason [2019] EWCA Crim 755, emphasising the need for proportionality and the recognition that low-level shoplifting ordinarily attracts penal responses proportionate to both the harm caused and the offender’s personal circumstances.

During the plea and trial preparation hearing on 22 September 2025, you entered a guilty plea on the day of trial listing. It is incumbent upon the court to reflect on the limited credit available for such late pleas, as established in R v. Gregory [2021] EWCA Crim 1123, where the Court confirmed that pleas made only when the evidential case becomes overwhelming are entitled to significantly less mitigation than early admissions, which enable more efficient disposal and less disruption to victims and witnesses alike.

This trend of late guilty pleas is of particular concern in the context of acquisitive crimes, where police resources are heavily taxed by protracted investigations and the multiplicity of incidents often requires exhaustive collation and cross-reference of evidence to secure convictions.

It cannot be overstated that while the offences may seem minor when taken individually, their cumulative impact is not trivial. The loss borne by retailers, often small or medium enterprises, accrues significantly over time, with knock-on effects for staffing, security costs, and commercial viability.

It is relevant to note that the wider social context in which cases of this nature arise is presently one characterised by challenges to public order and increasing pressure on frontline services. Many retailers now face fluctuating demands from shrinkage and fraud, pressured margins, and the rising costs of regulatory compliance. Against this background, continuing to tolerate opportunistic theft risks undermining community confidence and heightening commercial vulnerability.

The psychiatric assessment instructed to explore potential mitigating factors concluded that you suffer no diagnosed psychotic or major affective disorder. However, Dr Pauline Mercer, consultant forensic psychiatrist, identified marked features of personality dysfunction manifesting in impulsivity and episodes of poor decision-making under stress. Of particular note was the observation of moderate alcohol misuse, which your account to the examining clinician linked to social isolation and episodic anxiety.

Dr Mercer’s comprehensive report addresses the complex interaction of psychosocial factors contributing to offending behaviour, highlighting an absence of sustained engagement with mental health services or community support networks. She identified a moderate risk of reoffending but suggested that engagement with targeted intervention programmes could substantially mitigate this risk.

The court values, as always, the evidence of clinicians such as Dr Mercer. Their detailed analysis is essential to understanding the broader context in which offending occurs and to shaping appropriately calibrated sentencing responses which balance individual rehabilitation against the public interest in deterrence and protection.

The probation report prepared by Ms Reyes corroborates these findings, illustrating a history of insecure accommodation and limited social support but reveals no indication of involvement in organised crime or gang affiliation. It further notes past referrals to charitable support organisations which, regrettably, you declined to engage with.

Beyond the statutory and case law framework, this court cannot close its eyes to the wider social ramifications of shoplifting offences such as this. The phenomenon of retail crime has evolved considerably during the past decade, driven in part by economic pressures, but also by spatial and social factors including urban deprivation, the impact of digital marketplaces, and changes in policing priorities.

Many local authorities face acute resource limitations, with reductions in spending on community safety and youth diversion initiatives. The corollary often manifests as increased burden on private business security, where security guards, sensor systems, and insurance premiums represent additional costs absorbed disproportionately by smaller traders.

Courts must remain cognisant of these trends since it is within the aggregate that the public interest is served — not merely by punishing individuals but by recognising and addressing the systemic factors in play.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

It is also worth mentioning the repeated admonitions in sentencing literature against the use of custody for first-time or low-level offenders, especially where there is potential for community-derived interventions to reduce recidivism. Community orders incorporating rehabilitative requirements, cognitive behavioural therapy, and unpaid work have demonstrated efficacy in deterring future offending in suitable candidates.

In your case, the history of previous convictions for acquisitive offences is significant, as is your apparent reluctance to utilise available support services, a factor which raises concerns about the challenges that any court-imposed community regime might face in terms of compliance.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Litigation of similar nature to shoplifting but carrying markedly different implications for public protection has been the subject of notable appellate decisions. In R v. Selkirk [2017] EWCA Crim 1407, where the defendant was convicted of burglary with intent to steal, the court emphasised the invasive nature of the offence and resultant psychological harm to victims, endorsing custodial sentencing reflective of serious culpability. While your case involves no forced entry or violence, these distinctions serve to underline the graduated nature of theft-related offences and sentencing gradations.

In R v. Forster [2016] EWCA Crim 870, the court upheld a community sentence for a defendant convicted of shoplifting where evidence of hardship and genuine remorse was present and where the value stolen was modest. There, the mitigating factors were compelling. That said, the persistence of offending and failure to engage with support services in your case diminish the force of such mitigation.

Throughout these proceedings, this court has endeavoured to exercise judicial patience and understanding in light of the challenges facing individuals like yourself. It remains a truth, however, that the protection of public confidence, both in commercial spaces and in the justice system itself, demands robust and considered response in cases of repeated acquisitive offending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

Given the difficulties encountered with late pleas and the complexity of your circumstances, the court is of the opinion that a pre-sentence report is essential. This report should provide the probation service with an opportunity to carry out comprehensive risk and needs assessments, including exploration of potential interventions addressing any underlying impulsivity, substance use, or financial management issues, and the feasibility of a community-based disposal.

It is my instruction that the probation officer also assesses mental health and social welfare needs in conjunction with local agencies, including housing support providers and addiction services, to ensure a holistic plan that addresses both rehabilitation and the overarching objective of public safety. The report should comment on suitability for unpaid work, attendance at accredited cognitive skills programmes, and any restorative justice options that might be available or appropriate.

I counsel your legal representatives to co-operate fully with requests and to ensure that all relevant material, including any new information, is submitted promptly for proper consideration. The proper administration of justice requires such co-operation.

Professional courtesies  
I would like to acknowledge the contributions of Ms Anna Whitford, for the Crown Prosecution Service, whose advocacy has been professional and measured throughout. Similarly, Mr Daniel Mason, representing you on a full representation order, has conducted himself with due diligence, navigating the inevitable procedural complexities competently. It is a mark of a properly functioning adversarial system that both Crown and defence advance their cases with zeal but within the bounds of respect for the court.

It may be of minor relevance but the courtroom has recently undergone refurbishment to improve accessibility and audiovisual facilities. The new screen system enabled unambiguous display of evidence excerpts and has been well received by practitioners, witnesses, and court staff alike. The usher, Mr Timothy Clarke, deserves commendation for maintaining order and ensuring the smooth conduct of the hearing, even in the face of an unexpected need for interpreter services which, thankfully, arrived promptly after a slight delay.

This sentencing hearing is conducted openly, consistent with the principle of open justice, which underpins public confidence in the fairness and transparency of the judicial process. It is an unfortunate truth, however, that despite the courts being open to the public and press alike, there is often minimal external interest in cases concerning lower-level property crimes—even when such offences cumulatively exert significant burden upon victims and the justice system.

Indeed, as is often observed in modern criminal practice, much of the public debate tends to be focused elsewhere—in cases involving violent or sensational crime, or those involving high-profile individuals—leaving routine but no less impactful offending beneath the radar of wider societal scrutiny. This disconnect poses challenges not only for crime prevention but also for the maintenance of respect for the law and its institutions.

In conclusion, Mr H, your conduct falls within that regrettable category of persistent acquisitive offending which undermines confidence, imposes very real detriments upon small business owners and their employees, and imposes a disproportionate burden on already stretched public resources. Your personal circumstances and the expert evidence submitted indicate no major mental disorder but do highlight vulnerability through impulsivity and poor coping mechanisms.

You have, admittedly, pleaded guilty late in proceedings, and so the credit for that must be limited.

Before imposing sentence, I shall await the full pre-sentence report focused
