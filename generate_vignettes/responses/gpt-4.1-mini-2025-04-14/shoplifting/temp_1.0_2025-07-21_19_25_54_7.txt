IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/14839  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge P. L. BRANFORD  
Filed: 17 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of offences involving theft from retail establishments, contravening section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour spans a protracted period beginning in mid-2023 through to the spring of this year and involves multiple sites across the Greater Manchester metropolitan area. This court has previously noted the endemic challenges presented by shoplifting cases, particularly when they exhibit elements of persistence and repetition.  

Procedural Background  
You were apprehended on 22 April 2025 following an investigation led by the Manchester Business Crime Unit (BCU), in conjunction with local police divisions and security teams operating in partnership with the Greater Manchester Retailers’ Association. This investigation was prompted by an uptick in reports of theft involving a male matching your description frequenting various high street pharmacies and convenience outlets. Surveillance and loss prevention protocols activated over several months culminated in evidence sufficient to support your arrest and subsequent charge.  

It is well recognised that while instances of shop theft are often perceived as low-level or victimless, the reality for retail workers and proprietors can be starkly different. The emotional impact on employees, the economic toll on businesses, and the wider community consequences are considerations this court must bear in mind. It is a regrettable feature of modern retail environments that injuries sustained to morale and safety perceptions appear disproportionate to the value of stolen goods alone.  

The case was allocated a Custody Time Limit under the provisions and directives of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You were formally interviewed on 24 April 2025, at which you denied the allegations initially but subsequently entered guilty pleas at a postevidence review hearing on 30 September 2025. The chronology of your pleas reflects a pattern common in acquisitive crime cases and has been a subject of considerable judicial scrutiny, as outlined in case law such as R v. McArdle [2021] EWCA Crim 2014.  

It is reasonable to observe that the delays occasioned by repeated expert report applications were compounded by administrative bottlenecks within the Legal Aid Agency. Applications for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist — intended to assist with evaluating any underlying cognitive or behavioural issues relevant to sentencing — encountered protracted responses. Such delays serve not only to impede the rights of the defence but also stretch judicial resources unnecessarily, a matter of ongoing systemic concern. The court notes, without further elaboration, that several hearings were adjourned accordingly.  

It is also the case that the proceedings have occasioned contributions from a number of third-party agencies. These include correspondence from the Manchester Homeless Outreach Service, which, while tangential to this case, underlines the intersectionality between poverty, mental health, and criminal justice involvement. The court also acknowledges recent communications from Family Support Action Group, whose remit includes advocacy for vulnerable individuals caught within the criminal system.  

The Business Crime Reduction Partnership has issued a statement noting a moderate rise in shoplifting offences within the district, consistent with regional trends. Curiously, their submission makes passing reference to a separate arson attack at a retail unit in Ashton-under-Lyne in late 2024. That incident, involving the wilful ignition of combustible materials outside a clothing store, has no factual or legal linkage with your case but serves as a reminder that the scope of offences affecting retail businesses extends beyond acquisitive crime alone.  

Legal Context and Relevant Case Law  
The Theft Act 1968 remains the governing statutory framework for matters of dishonesty and appropriation of goods without consent. The Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences, last updated in 2022, directs courts to consider factors including the sophistication of the offending, the cumulative loss caused, prior history, and any aggravating or mitigating features such as vulnerability or evidence of remorse.  

In R v. Havers [2022] EWCA Crim 1602, the Court of Appeal affirmed the appropriateness of sentences reflecting both the economic impact and the psychological harm caused by repeat thefts involving distraction techniques and systematic planning. While the facts of that case differ materially, certain principles remain instructive here.  

Equally pertinent is the decision in R v. McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145, which dealt with burglary of a private dwelling. Although the case does not mirror the present circumstances, the appellate court’s reflections on balancing culpability and harm provide useful guidance on assessing proportionality in sentencing.  

In R v. Haslow [2021] EWCA Crim 1754, the Court considered importation of controlled substances via false compartments in vehicles, discussing the limits of credit for late pleas and the significance of misleading or contesting forensic evidence. Although those matters bear no direct relation to this case, they serve as cautionary exemplars regarding the timing and nature of pleas relevant to sentencing discounts.  

Likewise, the Court in R v. Latimer [2021] EWCA Crim 947 emphasised that repeat thefts from smaller retail units, employing deception and manipulation, justify custodial sentences to achieve deterrence and public protection.  

Consideration must also be given to the operation of the Better Case Management system, under which this case was listed. The BCM framework envisages early disclosure of material, timely trial dates, and minimisation of avoidable adjournments. While these principles have been generally observed in the present matter, the court is alert to the procedural hurdles occasioned by delayed expert reports and intermittent defence representations.  

The Business Crime Reduction Partnership has also noted the impact of staffing shortages within police departments assigned to retail crime, further complicating proactive prevention efforts. This systemic issue, while beyond the scope of this court’s jurisdiction, nonetheless frames the backdrop against which your offending unfolded.  

Incidentally, during the evidence hearing, the prosecution cited data from the Greater Manchester Digital Forensics Unit concerning mobile phone usage patterns and CCTV synchronisation. While such technological evidence is often invaluable, it nonetheless imposes a significant workload on specialist units, contributing to the increasing demands on policing resources.  

The facts of this case must be considered within this broader institutional and societal context, although the court’s focus remains firmly on the particulars of the offending and its consequences.  

Offending Behaviour and Facts  
The facts of the case, as admitted by you and supported by evidential materials, are as follows:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

The pattern of offending includes multiple instances where you exploited brief moments of distraction among store staff or took advantage of busy peak hours at retail premises, a technique noted in both prosecutorial submissions and probation assessments. The court was also presented with statements from affected staff reporting increased stress levels and concerns for personal safety consequent upon repeated theft incidents.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Victim impact statements, submitted in writing, attest to a climate of unease and diminished morale among employees. Such evidence underscores the non-financial harm caused by acquisitive crimes, reflecting judicial recognition that injury to employee confidence and wellbeing merits careful consideration in sentencing decisions.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

It is further noted in the case record that some stores altered their security protocols, including installation of additional hard tags and deployment of extra floor staff, measures intended to deter repeat offending but costly to implement. Albeit indirectly related, these operational changes form part of the harm matrix assessed by the court.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

The court acknowledges the submission from the Retail Support and Recovery Network, a voluntary sector organisation that has liaised with affected businesses to provide resilience training and reduction strategies. Their recent reports highlight increasing pressures on small enterprises in the Greater Manchester area, many operating on thin margins and vulnerable to shrinkage caused by theft and anti-social behaviour.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

The court also notes the probation service’s assessment placing you within a medium risk category for reoffending, based in part on your admitted history and the behavioural patterns identified in the present proceedings. This assessment references your prior convictions for similar conduct and highlights concerns about impulsivity and insufficient engagement with rehabilitative services.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

In the period preceding your arrest, police records indicate that you had been subject to a conditional caution and a community resolution scheme following incidents in 2022, neither of which resulted in sustained behavioural change. Such prior dispositions, while reflecting attempts at diversion, inevitably factor into the question of proportionality and deterrence in sentencing.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

Mental Health and Support Services  
Your legal representatives submitted a report from Dr Amina Farooq, consultant clinical psychologist, who conducted an assessment at the request of the defence. The report concluded that you do not suffer from any diagnosable mental illness or impairment that would diminish your responsibility for the offences. The analysis did observe certain personality traits, including marked impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and poor coping mechanisms, which may have contributed to your offending pattern.  

Regrettably, the report noted a lack of sustained engagement with financial advice services or substance misuse interventions, despite multiple offers made by community workers. The court is well aware of the acute pressures on support providers, many working with severely constrained resources and elevated caseloads. This is not an excuse for non-participation; rather, it is a context in which defendants are offered assistance that they decline or neglect.  

The probation service has likewise documented difficulties in securing your cooperation with behavioural change programmes, a pattern of significance in assessing the prospects of community-based disposals.  

It would be remiss not to mention that alongside your own situation, the court has received a letter from your sister, Ms Bernadette W., expressing concern for your welfare and a willingness to support you in accessing stable accommodation and employment opportunities. While familial support is always to be welcomed, the court retains responsibility for evaluating the objective facts before it.  

Concurrent Issues and Peripheral Observations  
It is noted that the landlord of your current accommodation had been issued a noise abatement notice several months ago, owing to disturbances unrelated to your conduct. While this is not a matter for adjudication here, it forms part of the wider picture presented during hearings.  

During the prosecution’s opening, mention was made, without direct application, of a co-defendant previously involved in a separate affray at a local public house involving pool cues and subsequent assault charges. That party, who is not connected with your case beyond proximity, is currently at large and the subject of ongoing investigation. The court reiterates that such information does not pertain to your circumstances save insofar as demonstrative of the diverse challenges faced by local law enforcement.  

There was a brief procedural delay caused by the late arrival of interpreter services for a witness from a non-English-speaking background, a fact which unfortunately caused a postponement of one hearing date. This deficiency, while regrettable, was swiftly rectified.  

The courtroom has recently undergone refurbishment, including the installation of thermal windows and upgraded lighting, contributing positively to the experience of those attending. The clerk of the court is acknowledged for maintaining orderly proceedings despite a packed court list.  

The court must also record that no media representatives were present for today’s hearing. This is emblematic of a tendency for offences of this nature—commonplace as they are—not to attract the level of public attention afforded to more sensational or violent crimes. The implications of this phenomenon merit no further comment but are noted for completeness.  

Sentencing Framework and Next Steps  
The court recognises that theft offences, even those deemed “low level,” carry an outsized impact, particularly when committed persistently against vulnerable businesses. The cases cited earlier provide helpful guideposts, while this court’s own jurisprudence increasingly emphasizes the need for a balanced response: deterrence tempered by opportunities for rehabilitation where appropriate.  

Your prior convictions and the evidence of limited engagement with interventions reduce prospects for community disposal but do not preclude such an outcome where accompanied by comprehensive supervision and support. The principle of proportionality is central to sentencing and must reflect both culpability and risk.  

Credit for your guilty pleas will be considered carefully. As established in R v. Lawrence [2022] EWCA Crim 1901, and reiterated in subsequent authorities, the timing and motivation behind a plea are crucial in determining the appropriate discount. Your plea at the postevidence review stage is relatively late and consequently attracts a more modest reduction than an early admission would. Such principles serve the twin aims of fairness and incentivising early acceptance of responsibility.  

The court is mindful of the reported strain on the Probation Service, whose workload limitations may affect capacity to support intensive supervision schemes. Likewise, the availability of local programmes addressing acquisitive offending remains patchy. These systemic realities inform the court’s approach but do not diminish statutory entitlements.  

In light of the above, I propose to adjourn for the preparation of a thorough pre-sentence report, incorporating input from probation, mental health liaison, and any relevant community support organisations. This report should specifically address your amenability to rehabilitative interventions and the feasibility of structured oversight measures in the community. Possible referrals to cognitive skills programmes or financial literacy training may be explored, although no commitment is made at this juncture.  

I have already received the report from Dr Farooq and the victim impact statements, which will form part of the tribunal’s consideration alongside the forthcoming probation assessment. The report should also appraise any potential accommodation difficulties that may bear on risk of reoffending or compliance.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Manchester. Proceedings have been duly transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentencing will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for registration and monitoring purposes.  

You are reminded of your right to appeal the sentence imposed within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged in this matter. Costs are reserved pending final sentencing.  

These are the orders of the court.
