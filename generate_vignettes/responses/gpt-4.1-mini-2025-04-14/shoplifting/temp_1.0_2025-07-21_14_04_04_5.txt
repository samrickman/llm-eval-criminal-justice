IN THE CROWN COURT AT WINCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14576  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. R. CRAWFORD  
Filed: 17 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of an indictment charging you with theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, involving multiple incidents over a protracted period extending from November 2023 through to March 2025, primarily in the Winchester and Eastleigh boroughs. The case has been listed in this court pending sentence following your recent guilty plea.

Procedural History and Background  
You were first brought before a magistrates’ court on 4 April 2025 and initially entered a not guilty plea on arraignment. The matter was subsequently committed to this Crown Court on the basis that the value of goods and the cumulative nature of offending warranted a higher court sentencing procedure. The case progressed under the Better Case Management (BCM) guidelines promulgated under Part 3 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Although delays were incurred — principally owing to the securing of appropriate legal aid funding for defence expert reports — the case was effectively managed within the permissible framework, with timely allocation to counsel and listing for plea and trial preparation.

It is notable that the delays in Legal Aid authorisations were reflective of systemic issues currently afflicting the provision of publicly funded legal services. The Legal Aid Agency’s administrative inefficiencies are increasingly becoming a source of frustration to practitioners and judiciary alike. Requests for instruction of forensic behavioural analysts and independent psychiatric assessments are recurrently hindered by prolonged correspondence, shifting application requirements, and absence of prompt decision-making. Such impediments are regrettable, breed uncertainty, and temporarily restrict the effective progress of cases — all of which should be of concern to stakeholders invested in the proper administration of justice.

The Crown’s case was supported by video surveillance compiled over a series of seven incidents, witness statements from retail staff and managers, as well as physical evidence recovered during a police search contemporaneous with your arrest on 7 April 2025. The defence solicitors’ application for a psychiatric report was granted on 28 July, with Dr Fiona Lacy instructed to provide an independent clinical opinion concerning your mental state and prospects for rehabilitation.

This court records its appreciation — albeit with some reservation — for the contribution of Dr Lacy, whose assessment was thorough and professionally prepared. Her report, dated 15 September 2025, apportions a mild diagnosis of adjustment disorder with anxious features, noting episodic impulsivity and underlying low mood. No overt psychosis or major psychiatric illness was found. The significance of this for sentencing will be addressed in due course.

I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of the Winchester Business Crime Reduction Partnership and the local Safer Neighbourhood Team, who provided invaluable operational support in collating evidence and informing community impact assessments. Their collaborative efforts with the retail premises have enhanced intelligence sharing and inter-agency coordination, albeit within the constraints of limited resources and fluctuating staffing levels.

Equally, I must note with a mixture of admiration and concern the voluntary sector agencies involved. Particularly, East Hampshire Community Outreach have offered sustained casework support to affected stores and staff. Their written submissions to this court, though cautious in tone, aptly highlight the strain imposed by repeated theft on already fragile businesses, and the psychological toll on employees anxious about recurring predatory incidents during working hours. Such remarks are a sober reminder that financial loss is but one component of harm.

Your defence team, led by Mr Oliver Haines under a Legal Aid representation order, have made detailed submissions regarding your personal history, the mitigating effect of your mental health status, and the importance of structured rehabilitative interventions. Mr Haines has been diligent and professional throughout, commensurate with the high standards expected in Crown Court advocacy.

The state of contemporary public services is, by this point, a matter of some public notoriety and lament. Amid burgeoning demand and austerity funding constraints, local mental health services, housing authorities, and debt advisory bodies struggle to meet the cumulative need presented by individuals engaged in repetitive acquisitive offending, particularly those contending with unstable social circumstances. The NHS England Mental Health Implementation Plan 2024 - 2029 recognises these pressures, yet it remains to be seen whether such strategic frameworks will rectify the endemic waiting times, short staffing, or geographical disparities which currently hamper effective outreach and engagement.

The court’s own observations suggest that the burden placed upon probation services, criminal justice social workers, and liaison officers is intensified by frequent shortfalls in co-location opportunities, inadequate risk information-sharing arrangements, and procedural bottlenecks occasioned by incomplete digital records. These factors inevitably influence the expediency and quality of rehabilitative efforts. Though such observations do not excuse offending conduct, they contextualise the systemic environment in which cases like yours arise.

There is an increasing prevalence, regrettably, of individuals who defer acknowledgement of guilt until late in the process, sometimes until the cusp of trial, as was the position here. While the law permits a full defence until proved otherwise, the late plea diminishes potential reduction for guilty plea credit. The Court of Appeal in R v. Makanjuola [2023] EWCA Crim 543 eloquently reaffirmed the principle that early admission materially assists the system rather than merely yielding tactical advantage. It is in this spirit that courts conserve such credit only where the plea is timely and sincere.

Reference may also be made to R v. Barrowclough [2022] EWCA Crim 1436, a case involving a defendant charged with possession of Class B substances and aggravated burglary, where late pleading — just prior to trial — reduced available mitigation substantially. Although the nature of the offending was markedly different, the principles governing the timing and quality of guilty pleas are directly pertinent.

Furthermore, I would acknowledge the precedent set in R v. Eaglesham [2019] EWCA Crim 1112 which concerned a series of small-scale but serial theft offences within a retail context. The defendant there, convicted on evidence including forensic fingerprint analysis and confessions post-arrest, received an immediate custodial sentence reflecting persistence and planning despite an absence of violence. This decision underlines the judiciary’s approach to cumulative offending — that persistence manifests deliberate disregard for legal constraints rather than momentary error.

It is not within the court’s remit to indulge sociological conjecture nor to moralise at length, yet it would be remiss not to note the broader social forces that surround cases like this. The landscape of urban and semi-rural retail has shifted considerably in recent years. Economic pressures, exacerbated by inflationary trends, an uncertain labour market, and digital disruption of traditional shopping habits have combined to create a precarious environment for small proprietors and their employees. Crime statistics from the Hampshire Constabulary’s 2024 annual report reveal a modest but discernible increase in shoplifting incidents, with a worrying trend toward repeat offenders targeting essential goods such as pharmaceuticals and hygiene products.

It is also an era marked by a visible increase in the number of persons experiencing street homelessness, begging, and the associated complex issues. This phenomenon is multifactorial in origin, involving structural factors such as lack of affordable housing and cuts to social welfare, alongside personal challenges including mental illness and substance misuse. These backdrop conditions may inform — but cannot excuse — the conduct engaged in by those brought before the court.

On occasion, I have observed that defendants invoke difficult personal circumstances and early life adversity in explanation of their offending. While such factors are often genuine and worthy of empathy, the court must balance understanding with the unambiguous requirement that criminal acts bear consequences. The legacy of policies such as the Troubled Families initiative, while relevant, does not absolve personal responsibility. The judiciary must resist the temptation of determinism when ordering justice.

It is worth reflecting, albeit tangentially, on a historically significant statute: the Larceny Act 1916, which preceded the Theft Act 1968. The former’s antiquated division of offences into larceny, embezzlement, and fraudulent conversion was replaced by the current, simplified codification, streamlining prosecutorial process. Such evolution in the law underscores the effort to make responses to property offences coherent, proportionate, and transparent. This matter is before the court precisely because such statutory reforms enable clear adjudication of repeated theft conduct.

Similarly, in another domain, the now-repealed powers under the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 to search for bladed articles in public spaces, though unrelated to this matter, illustrate how legal frameworks adapt to emerging public safety challenges. Cases like R v. Hunt [2017] EWCA Crim 811, involving possession of offensive weapons at urban transport hubs, display the courts’ firm stance on maintaining public order and safety. Though this carries no direct relevance, it serves to emphasise the judiciary’s consistent concern with deterrence and prevention.

I also record that the retail premises affected by the offending encompass a mixture of large chain stores and smaller independent outlets, some of which have reported substantial financial losses. A letter received from Mr Stephen Coates, manager of the Belmont Pharmacy, details the psychological strain on staff, citing an increase in sick leave and staff turnover attributed, in part, to anxiety over recurrent shoplifting. This echoes findings from a national survey by the British Retail Consortium, which documents the correlation between retail crime and workforce wellbeing.

The Regional Crime Analysis Unit of Hampshire Police have also provided a report indicating that organised shoplifting gangs operate in neighboring counties, engaging in the theft of high-value items such as designer clothing and electronics. Though not implicated here, this information contextualises the broader picture of retail theft as both local nuisance and, at times, part of more extensive criminal networks.

It is worth mentioning, though purely as historical interest in behavioural profiling, the 2014 case of R v. Kingswell [2014] EWCA Crim 855, which considered the psychology of repeat offenders engaged in distraction thefts. That case involved the use of complex diversion techniques to facilitate thefts in crowded supermarkets. While not factually connected, it informs the court’s understanding of offender typologies and risk pathways.

The court also received a supplementary report from the Probation Service, dated 2 October 2025, which highlights the pressures currently facing probation officers in the region. Staff shortages, combined with burgeoning caseloads averaging above recommended levels, contribute to increased turnover and diminished ability to provide sustained supervisory regimes. This systemic challenge must be borne in mind when considering the availability of community sentencing options.

Turning now to the facts of the offending itself: there were numerous incidents, often separated by several weeks, targeting a range of goods primarily including personal care items, pain relief medication, and non-perishable food products. CCTV footage shows consistent patterns of behaviour, involving the use of a concealed backpack and purposeful navigation of store layouts.

Your movements at one particular supermarket were recorded on no fewer than four occasions, during which you appeared to use distraction tactics to draw attention away from your concealment of goods in both your jacket and bag compartments. The frequency and planning evident in these actions are significant indicators of intent.

It has been noted that on two occasions you were observed wearing the same distinctive baseball cap, which featured prominently in store surveillance images. Forensic examination of items found in your residence revealed packaging from products identified as stolen during these incidents, further supporting the evidential case.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Your decision to persist despite previous cautions and community resolution warnings is troubling and suggests a calculated disregard for legal authority.

A particularly concerning element arises from a witness statement furnished by a store assistant, Ms Karen Ellis, describing her experience of intimidation during an attempted intervention on one of these occasions. Whilst no physical assault occurred, your conduct reportedly caused her to fear for her personal safety, leading her to request a reassignment from her post. The psychological impact on frontline retail workers is not to be underestimated.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}. {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

An additional matter of note, drawn from the probation report, is your sporadic engagement with welfare support services in the months leading up to the offences. You are reported as having declined appointments with debt counselling and housing liaison officers on multiple occasions, despite being in precarious accommodation. This rejection of assistance, combined with evidence of mild alcohol misuse, does not bode well for rehabilitation absent mandated intervention.

You were provided opportunities to comply with community resolutions and diversionary programmes, but unfortunately these efforts failed to deter further offending. The Crown brings
