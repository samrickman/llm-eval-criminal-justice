IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13459  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. E. CHANNEL  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence on a representative charge of theft, committed through a series of acts of shoplifting over an extended period in multiple retail locations within the Brighton and Hove area. The charge is brought pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, and this prosecution is reflective of a sustained pattern of dishonest conduct, rather than an isolated episode.

Procedural History and Pre-Trial Matters  
Your initial arrest occurred on 3 May 2025, after a protracted investigation led by the Sussex Police Commercial Crime Unit, in conjunction with the Brighton Retail Liaison Initiative. The case was managed under the Better Case Management processes introduced pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 3, with the aim of enhancing case preparation and expediting trial readiness. It is to the credit of the Crown Prosecution Service and your defence team that matters have proceeded on a largely uninterrupted timetable, notwithstanding delays occasioned by difficulties in obtaining Legal Aid funding for expert instruction.

It must be observed here that the Legal Aid Agency continues to present significant procedural challenges. Your defence instructed a forensic psychologist early in the proceedings, a request that was subjected to repeated bureaucratic scrutiny and shifted criteria for approval. This caused undue postponement of the psychiatric assessment which, in turn, delayed the court’s ability to progress sentencing evaluation. Such delays, regrettably common across the jurisdiction, undermine the efficient administration of justice and are a source of frustration not only for the court but for victims and witnesses alike. That this system should impose hurdles upon those seeking timely psycho-social evaluation in cases such as this should concern all stakeholders invested in due process.

The matter was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 29 July 2025. At that hearing, you initially entered a not guilty plea, despite the case having been supported by substantive CCTV evidence, witness statements, and recovered property with forensic linkage. Following further disclosure and submissions by your counsel, you changed your plea to guilty on 12 September 2025, shortly prior to the trial window.

It bears noting the court's well-established practice in relation to credit for guilty pleas, as articulated in R v. Archer [2023] EWCA Crim 423, which affirms that sentencing discounts should reflect not merely the entry of a plea but the timing and sincerity thereof. Late pleas, especially those entered shortly before trial, attract reduced mitigation when balanced against the inconvenience caused to victims who must prepare for evidence, the public cost of adjournments, and the impact on court administration. This principle, though routine, reflects a critical balance in a system faced with ever-increasing pressure on finite resources.

In addition to legal representation by Mr Theo Daniels, you have benefited from several letters of support from community organisations, including the Brighton Homeless Outreach Team and the Sanctuary Project. Their submissions highlight your housing instability and sporadic engagement with support services. These materials, while of note, do not diminish the seriousness with which offending behavior must be regarded.

Contextual and Societal Observations  
An analysis of current socio-economic indicators in Brighton reveals a fraught landscape for individuals on the margins of society. Rates of street homelessness, food insecurity, and mental health crises remain stubbornly high despite ongoing efforts by local authorities and third-sector bodies. Volunteer-led foodbanks report weekly increases in demand, and council housing allocations languish under systemic strain. This backdrop is germane only insofar as it contextualizes the pressures faced by those who offend. It cannot, and should not, excuse repetitions of unlawful conduct.

The complexity of enduring acquisitive offending is compounded by the rise of digital marketplaces that facilitate the rapid resale of stolen goods, often with untraceable cash flow and diffuse victim impact. Local retail partnerships strive to sustain businesses at risk of shrinkage, but resource constraints limit the scope of preventive measures, despite commendable efforts at intelligence sharing and staff training. Such realities form the external environment within which courts must operate but do not alter the fundamental questions of individual responsibility and public protection.

It is also appropriate to recall outdated provisions from the Theft Act 1978, which once bore on the classification of offences connected to attempted theft, but which have since been superseded by clearer statutory definitions under current legislation. Though no longer directly applicable, these historical provisions occasionally inform defence argumentation, as they did to some degree in this case. The court notes but does not regard the seductive siren calls of past statutory frameworks as grounds for leniency.

The facts of your offending, as established by admission and corroborated by evidence, present a picture of repeated incursions into a variety of retail spaces, including high street grocers, independent chemists, and small electronics outlets. These incursions were underpinned by a pattern of deliberate concealment of merchandise. Video footage demonstrates personation of a customer engaged in innocuous retail browsing before systematic extraction of items concealed beneath outer garments.

Relevant Case Law and Sentencing Principles  
The court is mindful of the guidance set forth in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guidelines, which underscore the need to consider not only the value of goods taken but the method of offending, the impact on victims, and the offender’s previous record. The aggregate impact of multiple low-value offences may well equate or exceed a singular high-value theft, especially when sustained over time.

The Court acknowledges the holdings in R v. Thornhill [2020] EWCA Crim 1019, where a sentence of immediate custody was deemed appropriate in the context of repeat theft from vulnerable independent retailers who suffered materially as a consequence. Similarly, the decision in R v. Knights [2022] EWCA Crim 559 is instructive. There, an offender who had exhibited persistent dishonesty and manipulation of self-checkout systems was sentenced to a community order with unpaid work requirements and rehabilitation activity points, a decision tempered by effective engagement with rehabilitative services.

In the present matter, these authorities assist in calibrating sentence severity, but must be applied with particular attentiveness to your personal circumstances and the broader public interest.

The court reminds itself of the principles enunciated in R v. Canning [2019] EWCA Crim 458, which clarified that offences involving coercion or threat elevate culpability significantly. Though the present offences do not include violence or threat, the intangible effects of repeated breaches of trust and economic harm to small businesses are well documented in victim impact statements.

Factual Narrative: Summary of Conduct  
Your pattern of offending involved visits to multiple retail establishments over the course of approximately sixteen months. Each incident was characterised by intentional selection of high-demand items which typically include toiletries, over-the-counter medications, and convenience goods. The items, while low in individual price, cumulatively represent a significant loss when aggregated.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Details within the evidentiary record indicate that you employed techniques such as the use of bags with false bottoms, tactical timing to coincide with staff shortages during shift changes, and distraction manoeuvres including simulated telephone conversations. Such strategies betray a degree of sophistication and premeditation.

It is worth noting that the pattern observed here typifies a modus operandi increasingly familiar to business crime units. Notwithstanding this, the absence of prior violent confrontation distinguishes your case from others in which offences have escalated to threaten personal safety.

The Impact on Victims and Retail Staff  
Victim statements submitted by several shop managers provide insight into the wider consequences of your conduct. These include increased anxiety among employees, changes to work patterns particularly reduced lone working provisions, and the installation of costly anti-theft devices. The emotional toll—manifesting in feelings of insecurity and mistrust—is a critical factor that courts are obliged to weigh.

In an interesting contrast, one victim's business reported reduced footfall during the course of your offences, attributable not only to shrinkage but to the perception among customers of diminished store safety and confidence. Such secondary effects compound the direct financial impact.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

While your offences do not appear to have included physical violence or threats thereof, the intangible damage to staff wellbeing and operational disruption remains a salient aggravating consideration, well-recognised in the jurisprudence.

Psychiatric and Pre-Sentence Reports  
A psychiatric report prepared by Dr Selina Harcourt, consultant forensic psychiatrist, offers a detailed appraisal of your mental health status. She concludes you do not meet criteria for any major psychiatric disorder, but notes presence of mild anxiety and features of borderline personality traits, which may contribute to impulsive behavior. The report highlights inconsistent engagement with community mental health services.

Probation assessments emphasise your current unstable housing situation and limited social support network, factors which correlate with heightened risk of reconviction absent structured intervention. It is regrettable that opportunities to stabilise your circumstances have not been fully taken up.

The Probation Service notes significant systemic strain across the region, with waiting lists extending over six months for relevant rehabilitation programmes. This delay inevitably complicates efforts to integrate meaningful support and risk management.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

By contrast, the report praises your written representations to the court as coherent and measured, a mark of apparent insight though it must be balanced against the factual account of persistent offending.

Situational and Structural Observations  
It is imperative to articulate as clearly as possible the wider context of offences such as these. The persistent rise of petty acquisitive crime in urban centres like Brighton has engendered a twofold challenge: the economic impact on vulnerable merchants and the consequent strain on public services tasked with crime prevention and investigation.

Concurrent pressures on policing, including redeployment to other priority areas such as violent crime and organised gangs, reduce the frequency with which such offences are proactively tackled. This observation must not be mistaken for leniency, but serves to highlight the delicate balance authorities must maintain.

A related comment merits attention. The emergence of mobile ‘legal highs’ and accessible synthetic opioids in the area contributes to a cycle of addiction and crime that intersects with acquisitive offending. This broader public health crisis exacerbates marginalisation and complicates enforcement.

The court is reminded of the judgment in R v. McFarlane [2021] EWCA Crim 623, which, although concerned with aggravated burglary, underscored the importance of integrating public protection and rehabilitation in sentencing where underlying substance misuse is implicated.

I also note — with no direct bearing on this case — that a co-defendant, Mr A, involved in an unrelated matter, recently pleaded guilty to an affray at a local licensed premises. His conduct, involving an altercation with bystanders using improvised weapons, is entirely separate and does not affect your sentencing considerations.

Legal Aid, Court Delays, and Administrative Observations  
The efficient administration of justice remains an overarching concern in cases such as these. Despite the court’s best efforts to list and manage the hearing timetable, unavoidable strain—aggravated by nationwide tribunal staff shortages and rolling legal aid negotiations—impinged on procedural fluidity.

Periodically during the case management process, listings were postponed owing to shortfalls in intermediary staffing for vulnerable defendants, a difficulty reflected in court logs. Such challenges are symptomatic of systemic underinvestment in justice infrastructure.

I must commend the thoughtful submissions from your legal team. Mr Daniels’ advocacy throughout entailed diligent exploration of mitigating factors and robust scrutiny of evidential sufficiency, even as he acknowledged the strength of the prosecution’s case.

The court registrar and court ushers are also due acknowledgment, having managed a recently refurbished courtroom environment with professionalism and courtesy, ensuring fair access to all participants.

Sentencing Considerations  
The factors weighed in this sentencing calculus include the frequency and planning evident in your offending; the cumulative financial and psychological harm to victims; your antecedent record indicating repeated acquisition offences; and the absence of violence or intimidation.

Mitigating features reside in your late but unequivocal guilty plea, partial acceptance of responsibility, and indications of willingness to engage with support services, albeit limited to date. Your personal circumstances — including disruption caused by homelessness and family breakdown — must be understood as influencing but not excusing offending behaviour.

The court must balance punishment, deterrence, public protection, and rehabilitation. The need to send a clear signal about the unacceptability of repeated theft remains paramount. At the same time, consideration of proportionality cautions against custody as the sole or inevitable outcome, especially where community interventions may reduce risk more effectively.

In reaching its provisional conclusions, the court has examined authorities including R v. Davies [2018] EWCA Crim 634, which underscores that community sentences, coupled with rehabilitative requirements, can be appropriate for acquisitive offenders where public protection can be assured. The Sentencing Council reiterates the desirability of flexibility in tailoring sentences to individual needs.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

Conclusion  
It remains for the court to direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report from the Probation Service, who will be asked to give their professional opinion on risk, appropriate interventions, and suitability for community rehabilitation or custodial custody.

This report should include full consideration of your mental health, substance use, housing status, family relationships, and employment history; and must provide reasoned recommendations on programme availability and capacity issues.

The formal sentencing hearing has been conducted in open court, with all relevant parties present. I note the exemplary discretion demonstrated by shop workers giving evidence and the pragmatic approach taken by victim organisations. I extend my gratitude to the prosecuting counsel, Ms Imogen Vail
