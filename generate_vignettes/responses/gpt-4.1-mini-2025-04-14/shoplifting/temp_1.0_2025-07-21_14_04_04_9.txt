IN THE CROWN COURT AT STRATFORD-UPON-AVON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. D2025/05433  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge C. J. BRADFORD  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentencing relating to allegations of theft from retail premises over a period extending approximately from November 2023 through to May 2025. The indictment before the court charges you with multiple counts, consolidated for administrative and practical reasons, all falling within the statutory provisions of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences in question relate chiefly to incidents occurring within stores in the Stratford metropolitan area and adjoining districts.

This court acknowledges the protracted nature of proceedings in cases of this type, where the accumulation of evidence from various retailers, detailed scrutiny of hours of security footage, and interviews with staff and witnesses often extend investigative timelines considerably. The Better Case Management (BCM) framework, under which this matter was transferred to Crown Court, aims to enhance the quality and speed of case progression but is frequently hampered by the multifaceted challenges present in cases involving repeat low-level offending. Such challenges are neither trivial nor to be diminished. They place considerable strain upon police investigative resources, the limited time available to retail staff for cooperation, and the overburdened court lists.

The public's faith in the justice system is contingent upon its capacity to deliver both prompt and proportionate outcomes. The administrative and evidential demands presented by persistent shoplifting offences continue to test these capacities, and I note with regret the repeated observations of delay attributable, in part, to the complexities of evidence collation and disclosure. For these reasons, the court is steadfast in encouraging all stakeholders to uphold the principles of expedition and proportionate process.  

The investigation that led to your arrest involved coordination between the Stratford police Retail Crime Unit and the Business Crime Reduction Partnership for the region. This local partnership, activated following a series of theft reports from independent pharmacies and convenience stores, compiled intelligence reports and shared analytical findings across agencies. While such partnerships are designed to compress information flows and pre-empt repeat offending, their effectiveness varies significantly according to local resources and institutional memory.

It should be noted in passing that the retail sector in Stratford and surrounding areas has suffered increasing losses due to a combination of factors including economic downturn, rising operation costs, and the residual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behaviour. Theft and shrinkage, while a long-standing issue, have seen measurable upticks post-pandemic, with small businesses particularly hard hit. The court acknowledges that this pattern has broader economic and social ramifications beyond the immediacy of individual cases.

On the procedural front, this matter was first listed in the magistrates’ court on 12 June 2025. Your initial pleas were not entered until 2 August 2025, after adjournments occasioned in part by ongoing Legal Aid applications for psychiatric evaluation. I record my dissatisfaction with the delays occasioned in securing timely funding approval for expert reports, which adversely impacted case progression. It is imperative for the integrity of the system that such administrative hurdles be minimised to allow for a fair and expeditious hearing.

The Legal Aid Authority's performance in this regard corroborates a recurring theme across many Crown Courts in England and Wales. Counsel acting on your behalf encountered multiple correspondences with the agency before the necessary sanction to instruct a forensic psychologist was granted. Such delays, though perhaps incidental in isolation, cumulatively erode public confidence and impair the administration of justice. The court acknowledges the dedication of practitioners who persevered notwithstanding these systemic obstacles.

Further, the court wishes to place on record its appreciation for the support provided by Stratford Community Outreach Services and the regional branch of the Retail Support Network. These voluntary and charitable organisations have contributed valuable contextual information regarding the impact of retail theft on small businesses and their employees. Their representations were characterised by balanced recognition of both the operational challenges and the human consequences stemming from the defendant's behaviour.

It becomes necessary at this juncture to reference the legal landscape within which this matter is situated. The Theft Act 1968, as amended, has long served as the keystone statute regulating dishonesty offences in retail contexts. Section 1 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. Case law has further refined the concepts of dishonesty and intention, most notably in R v Ghosh [1982] QB 1053, which established a two-stage test for dishonesty, and the subsequent clarifications in Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67, which modified that understanding.

In your case, it is undisputed that the property appropriated belonged to the retailers. While the issue of dishonesty is not contested, as you have entered guilty pleas reflecting acceptance of responsibility, the court must still weigh aggravating and mitigating factors in proceedings towards sentence.

The court also had regard to the Sentencing Council’s Theft offences definitive guideline (issued July 2023), which provides a framework for assessing culpability, harm, and personal mitigation. The guideline indicates that persistent acquisitive offending, particularly when targeted at vulnerable or small locally owned premises, attracts increased seriousness.

The Crown submits that your offending pattern demonstrates a deliberate, calculated approach, including the use of distraction tactics, concealment, and frequent returns to the same establishments. The prosecution also advances the position that your repeated contravention of informal community resolutions and previous warnings elevates the culpability and justifies a custodial response.

At this point, it is customary to set out a fuller account of the circumstances leading to your conviction. Given the volume of evidence presented, including CCTV footage, store reports, and recovered property inventories, a detailed description is warranted as the factual foundation upon which sentence will be structured.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

While the offences are of a non-violent nature, the court has consistently acknowledged, in line with appellate guidance, the cumulative distress to victims — both direct and indirect. The burden on store personnel, the erosion of workplace morale, and the financial hit suffered all factor into the court's evaluation of culpability.

Numerous victim impact statements were tendered to the court. They detail the psychological effect of the offending on persons employed within affected establishments. These statements, though not presenting evidence of physical injury or threat, recount experiences of anxiety, hypervigilance, and in some cases, sick leave taken due to stress-related symptoms. This emotional cost transcends the mere value of stolen property and merits recognition.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

Parallel to these considerations, your recorded conduct exhibits features reinforcing the calculated nature of the offending, including instances of switching items between bags, deliberate mislabelling, and repeated visits within short time frames. The sophistication of these techniques indicates a level of premeditation beyond spontaneous lapse.

The court has reviewed the evidence presented and notes the notable precision and caution with which offences were committed. The frequency of return visits to specific outlets — at times within hours of previous incidents — signals not just opportunistic but systematic intent.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

In contrast, submissions on behalf of your defence paint a picture of personal hardship, unstable housing circumstances, and underlying mental health difficulties. These factors, while neither excusing nor diminishing personal responsibility, are material to the sentencing exercise.

The psychiatric report, prepared by Consultant Clinical Psychologist Dr Sabina Ettinger, assesses your mental state and potential contributory factors. Dr Ettinger documents traits consistent with intermittent impulse control disorder, as well as mild depressive symptomatology. The report makes clear, however, that these do not amount to conditions warranting a diminished responsibility or impose limitations on your criminal capacity.

Dr Ettinger’s report advocates for the consideration of structured community intervention tailored to address emotional regulation, substance use, and financial management. She emphasises that your engagement with such programmes has, to date, been intermittent and that sustained participation is critical to reducing reoffending risk.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

While the report is useful, the court must emphasise the distinction between mitigation and excuse. The presence of vulnerability or mental health challenges invites a nuanced approach, but it does not absolve responsibility, particularly in the context of a repeated pattern of offending.

It is of course regrettable that services designed to assist vulnerable individuals are often overstretched, with waiting lists for NHS mental health teams and community addiction programmes perceived as prohibitive. The court has, in multiple recent cases, noted the pressures upon public health provision and the subsequent impact on rehabilitation pathways.

Equally, it cannot be overlooked that your record reveals a lack of sustained engagement with available support services. Voluntary sector agencies have reported multiple unsuccessful attempts to establish and maintain contact, notwithstanding repeated offers of assistance and tailored interventions.

The court also notes correspondence from the Stratford Housing Support Service, which describes the intensely challenging housing landscape within the region. The shortage of affordable accommodation, combined with longer wait times for council placements, results in many individuals residing in temporary or emergency accommodation for extended periods. While such conditions can exacerbate personal instability, they do not confer exemption from legal accountability.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Your criminal record includes three prior convictions for theft-related offences, with the most recent dating to April 2023, where you received a community resolution. The apparent failure of that resolution’s deterrent effect is notable, as is your resumed offending within a comparatively short timespan.

The principle of escalation applies here, as courts increasingly regard failure to desist from previous informal measures as indicative of increased culpability. The court is bound, therefore, to scrutinise whether a custodial sentence is necessary to achieve deterrence and protect the public interest.

Despite the pervasive financial pressures bearing down on ordinary households, it is well-established that economic hardship is not an excuse for repeated criminality. The availability of assistance through food banks, debt advice agencies, and charitable outreach programmes is no insignificant factor, though the court acknowledges the structural barriers faced by many.

Turning to sentencing analytics, guidance from the Sentencing Council emphasises the importance of individualised assessment, including consideration of rehabilitation prospects, risk of reoffending, and the impact of sentence type.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

On the procedural side, I recorded earlier the delays occasioned by funding approvals for psychological assessment. Additionally, I must acknowledge the efforts of Mr Alfred Connolly, your counsel, who presented well-considered representations on your behalf. The Crown was ably represented by Ms Uma Patel.

Requests for adjournments were made due to late receipt of some character references, including a letter from your sister, Mrs Elaine Crosland, which attests to your amenability and intention to reform. This letter, alongside others from voluntary groups, portrays a picture of a person grappling with mental health and economic challenges but endeavouring, nonetheless, to make positive changes.

It is worth pausing to observe how, in a broader social context, examples of community and familial support may act as catalysts for rehabilitation. Courts are increasingly attuned to the role of informal social capital in reducing recidivism. Such insights must, however, be balanced against the objective nature of the offending and public protection imperatives.

In conducting this sentencing exercise, I also keep in mind the recommendations contained in the probation officer’s pre-sentence report, which offers a considered evaluation of your personal circumstances, risk profile, and available intervention pathways.

The probation service highlights your medium risk of reoffending due to acquisitive behaviours but assesses your risk of serious harm as low. It further emphasises the potential benefits of structured community orders with activity requirements focused on cognitive behavioural therapy tailored to criminal thinking patterns. The report advises that attention be given to your apparent impulsivity and financial instability.

Turning briefly to the wider judicial milieu, it is appropriate to cite R v. Yates [2022] EWCA Crim 1678, in which the Court of Appeal remarked on the necessity of proportionate sentencing in cases of persistent retail theft. Yates stressed that while early pleas attract greater mitigation, late pleas must be calibrated alongside the impact on victims and public confidence.

Moreover, R v Dunlap [2023] EWCA Crim 349 examined the effect of prior community disposals on sentencing uplift at the Crown Court stage. The court made clear that where prior diversions fail to deter, escalation to custodial sentences is often warranted—especially where repeated offending causes sustained harm to local businesses.

It is also pertinent to consider the observations of R v. Harrow [2021] EWCA Crim 912, where the Court cautioned about the dangers of allowing systemic delays—particularly those emanating from overwhelmed Legal Aid and probation services—to erode
