IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/02143  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J. Ellington  
Filed: 14 September 2026  

Mr H, you appear before this Court for sentencing upon a charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, following a course of conduct involving multiple shoplifting incidents over an extended period, primarily concentrated within the commercial districts of Brighton and the surrounding area. This indictment, while representing a single count, encapsulates a series of discrete acts of offending which collectively paint a pattern of persistent acquisitive criminality.  

Procedural History and Court Context  
Your custodial proceedings commenced with your arrest on 19 March 2026 by the Sussex Police Retail Crime Unit, following an investigation initiated as part of an ongoing response to an increase in retail thefts affecting independent pharmacies and convenience stores in Brighton city centre. This investigation was noteworthy for its collaborative nature, engaging a multi-agency approach encompassing not only Sussex Police but also representatives from the Brighton & Hove Business Crime Reduction Partnership, retail security partners, and the Safer Neighbourhoods Team. The scale of co-ordination reflects the evolving approach towards such offences, viewed less as isolated infractions and more as part of an interconnected pattern of acquisitive conduct adversely impacting the fabric of local commerce and community wellbeing.  

This Court must observe that for so-called “low-level” offences of theft, the demands placed on policing and ancillary agencies are disproportionately high. The cost, both economic and administrative, is considerable: CCTV footage must be scrutinised with painstaking care, witness statements elicited and repeated, and intelligence periodically refreshed and cross-referenced against known offender profiles. It is not uncommon for the investigation of a single retail theft to generate disclosure bundles several hundred pages thick, a task often undertaken against a backdrop of staff shortages and workload escalation. These pressures come alongside increasingly complex evidential standards governing digital material and forensic analysis, placing acute strain on the resources of all bodies involved.  

The case was allocated to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, intended to expedite proceedings in a manner consistent with the interests of justice and resource stewardship. Despite an initial adjournment occasioned by the late provision of defence instructions relating to psychiatric evaluation, subsequent hearings proceeded without undue delay, a testament to the professionalism of all parties engaged.  

During the plea and trial preparation hearing convened on 2 July 2026, you entered a not guilty plea, only to ultimately amend your position to guilty on the morning of trial after the prosecution served additional CCTV evidence and witness statements. Such late pleas, although within your rights, are frequently regarded with circumspection, as they do not confer the same degree of credit as early acceptance of responsibility affords. As stated in authority, including R v Odeh [2024] EWCA Crim 658, the timing and sincerity of the plea are material considerations.  

The Crown’s position has been competently advanced by Ms Clara Simmons, who has submitted written and oral representations addressing aggravating factors and victim impact. I thank counsel for their measured advocacy. Defence submissions have been articulated by Mr Giles Ransome under a representation order, whose co-operation and professionalism are likewise acknowledged, notwithstanding procedural complexities encountered mid-proceedings, notably several requests for extensions to service defence disclosure triggered by supplementary psychiatric material.  

It may be appropriate at this juncture to note the ongoing strains upon the Legal Aid Agency, whose administrative inefficiencies have, once again, delayed timely engagement of expert opinion in this case. Applications for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist experienced in impulsive acquisitive offending faced repeated bureaucratic obstacles, necessitating multiple resubmissions and causing avoidable postponements. Such systemic bottlenecks undermine the equitable progression of justice and deserve formal criticism; more adequate resourcing and streamlined protocols are imperative.  

The court also acknowledges the dedication of the Brighton Retail Victim Support Network, whose submissions have illuminated the ripple effects of your conduct on local businesses, staff wellbeing, and the community’s wider sense of safety. Their participation embodies the vital role of voluntary sector organisations in complementing formal enforcement and judicial mechanisms. Though constrained by limited funding and high caseloads, they provide a consistent and constructive service deserving of recognition.  

Legal Framework and Precedents  
The core legal provision against which this offending is measured is section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, which defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. While theft may encompass a broad spectrum of conduct, the sentencer is obliged to consider not just the actus reus but also the context of the conduct, including frequency, method, target, and resultant harm.  

The Sentencing Council’s guidelines for theft offences establish levels of culpability, reflecting the severity of the offence elements, including premeditation, sophistication, and impact. Aggravating factors such as repeat offending, targeting vulnerable victims, and causing distress or disruption to staff are relevant considerations to be weighed alongside any mitigating circumstances.  

Whilst the charge before this Court is a single count, it represents a cumulative course of conduct spanning multiple retail incidents, thus attracting scrutiny beyond the nominal value of individual items taken. The Court’s remit encompasses consideration of the totality and pattern of behaviour, aligned with judicial guidance established in authorities such as R v. Bloomfield [2019] EWCA Crim 1023, where it was held that the aggregate nature of dishonesty offences may justify enhanced sentencing even when individual thefts are minor in value.  

Reference may also be made to R v Ashford [2022] EWCA Crim 1745, which concerned the theft of pharmaceuticals from a community-based dispensary. The Court of Appeal there underscored the heightened seriousness attributable to offences impacting healthcare provision, noting the potential indirect consequences for vulnerable patients whose access to medication may be impeded. The relevance of these principles is echoed in the present case insofar as your offending targeted similar premises, undermining not only commercial interests but public health imperatives.  

Other legal precedents, though unrelated in facts but illustrative of sentencing principles, include R v. Caldwell [2018] EWCA Crim 993, involving environmental offences through fly-tipping on protected greenbelt land. That judgement emphasised the cumulative damage from repeated offences, regardless of each individual act’s apparent triviality. While this matter is not environmental, the analogy serves to remind that persistent, low-level offending can compound social harm disproportionately.  

Similarly, R v. Cartwright [2020] EWCA Crim 847 addressed offences of affray arising out of a pub disturbance. Though unrelated to theft, the Court’s observations on community impact and the maintaining of public order resonate with the themes present in this case. These authorities collectively illustrate the judiciary’s principled approach to protecting not just property but public confidence and day-to-day community functioning.  

It is notable, and somewhat ironic, that the case management hearing of 8 May 2026 was delayed owing to a separate arson incident in Court 5, involving damage to commercial premises at a neighbouring complex. While wholly unconnected to your offending, the incident contributed to a backlog in listings, exemplifying the compound challenges faced by courts managing high volumes with limited venues. Such procedural delays, while regrettable, lie beyond the control of the parties and judiciary alike.  

Statements of Fact and Offending Behaviour  
The facts underpinning your conviction derive primarily from the gathered unaided and secured CCTV footage, staff witness statements, and forensic analysis of items recovered during a search of your temporary accommodation pursuant to warrant. The essence of the Crown case is a sustained pattern of shoplifting on multiple occasions spanning the period from late 2025 to early 2026.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

The episodes involved a consistent modus operandi, targeting specific product categories—principally hygiene items, over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, and cosmetic goods—with the utilisation of tactics such as concealment in clothing, price tag removal, and distraction of shop staff.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

In several instances, your conduct was marked by opportunistic timing, exploiting periods of staff transition or reduced supervision. Notably, on one occasion, footage depicts you engaging in a prolonged conversation on a mobile device while exiting the premises without payment.  

The store managers have provided detailed accounts of the deleterious effects of your conduct. Enhanced security measures, including installation of anti-theft devices and the alteration of staff shift patterns, were directly attributable to your repeated visits.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The material loss to businesses, while modest individually, aggregated to a significant cumulative figure when calculated across the offences. More pertinently, the psychological impact on employees—evidenced through submitted victim impact statements—reflects an erosion of workplace morale and heightened anxiety. These factors, though intangible, are recognised as elements of harm in our modern sentencing framework.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Multiple prior interventions were recorded, including previous community resolution schemes and warnings. Despite these efforts, you resumed offending within a matter of weeks, demonstrating a lack of genuine intent to desist.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

This persistence justified continued policing attention and resource allocation, diverting personnel from other priorities in the public protection domain—a consequence probed with considerable seriousness in expert witness testimony.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Further details derive from seized personal property during initial investigative searches, including clothing items forensically analysed and linked to the known incidents. These links proved critical in disproving early denials and establishing identity beyond reasonable doubt.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The Crown also relies upon your interactions with local authority outreach workers, who documented your refusal of proposed support measures, including engagement with substance misuse services and financial counselling. Such refusals bear significantly upon the assessment of your risk and remedial prospects.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The Court must emphasise that your offending did not involve violence, nor was there evidence of coercion or exploitation by third parties. However, the calculated and consistent nature of your actions denotes a high degree of culpability.  

Expert and Ancillary Reports  
The psychiatric assessment, conducted by Dr Solomon Erskine, consultant forensic psychiatrist, presents a comprehensive but ultimately non-exculpatory profile. Your mental health is characterised by traits of impulsivity and mild depressive features, yet there is no diagnosis of major psychiatric disorder such as psychosis or severe personality disorder. Dr Erskine notes difficulties with emotional regulation and low motivation for change, compounded by socio-economic instability.  

The probation pre-sentence report, prepared by Ms Hannah Levens, provides a detailed account of your background and offending history. She notes four prior theft convictions spanning the past five years, a pattern of unstable accommodation, and inconsistent engagement with support services. While acknowledging some indicators of vulnerability, particularly in relation to housing insecurity, the report ultimately recommends a structured community sentence with an offender rehabilitation requirement, targeted at cognitive skills enhancement and financial management.  

Of significant concern is your pattern of disengagement from voluntary agencies, including the Brighton Housing Alliance, who have documented repeated attempts to elicit your participation without success. This reticence undermines prospects for rehabilitation and increases risk of recidivism. The probation service faces severe capacity constraints, with officer caseloads regularly exceeding recommended limits, which further complicates effective supervision.  

Housing pressures in Brighton and Hove, compounded by rising homelessness and the degradation of social housing stock, form a salient backdrop to your case. The court observes with regret the systemic failures resulting in delayed access to stable accommodation, leading to cyclical homelessness and offending. Nevertheless, while these systemic difficulties provide context, they do not absolve personal responsibility.  

Discussion of Broader Context and Public Interest  
This Court shares the widely expressed concern over incremental erosion of community order evidenced by low-level acquisitive crime. The cumulative impact extends far beyond straightforward economic loss, engendering an atmosphere of insecurity among shop workers and proprietors, many of whom operate on thin margins with limited capacity to absorb theft-related losses. Research recently published by the Retail Crime Analysis Group (2025) supports the view that such offences cumulatively contribute to urban decline, forced closures, and diminished public amenity.  

Equally, the pressures placed upon policing resources constrict capacity to investigate more serious violent offences. It is an oft-cited dilemma that persistent petty offending indirectly undermines broader public safety by redirecting attention and disproportionately consuming finite investigative assets. This argument, explored in recent policy discourse within the Home Office, stresses the necessary balance between managing low-level crime and safeguarding strategic law enforcement priorities.  

While this Court hears repeated submissions on the theme of “necessity” or “survival theft” linked to poverty and social marginalisation, it is recollected that the law carefully differentiates between difficult circumstances and criminal justification. The availability of social welfare provision, while imperfect, remains a fundamental pillar in the prevention of criminal conduct. The judicial role remains one of measured response: neither condoning offending nor overlooking the factors that may underpin it.  

Reference is made to the historical evolution of sentencing protocols. The Theft Act 1968 itself marked a reformulation of prior piecemeal legislation, consolidating theft offences into a single coherent offence category. Since that time, amendments and guideline developments have sought to reflect contemporary values, shifting emphasis onto victim impact and offender rehabilitation alongside deterrence.  

Other relevant cases illustrate the necessity of this balance. In R v Everitt [2015] EWCA Crim 78, a defendant convicted of burglary with an extensive history of drug-related acquisitive crime received an immediate custodial sentence, highlighting the judiciary’s role in protecting communities from recidivist patterns. In contrast, R v Elbourne [2017] EWCA Crim 413 emphasised the importance of rehabilitative prospects and support service availability in mid-range theft offending, underscoring the complexity of sentencing decisions in this domain.  

The Court further notes a recent report commissioned by the National Retail Federation (2026), which highlights the rise in shoplifting during a period marked by social turbulence and economic instability, while also stressing the need for non-custodial interventions where appropriate.  

Sentencing Considerations and Next Steps  
The offences before the Court betray a degree of persistence and planning incompatible with impulsive lapse or momentary desperation. Your history confirms sustained involvement in similar conduct despite previous interventions. The harm to business owners and staff—though lacking physical violence—is genuine and enduring.  

The late plea, entered only after the service of unassailable evidential material, admits responsibility but limits the mitigating effect such an admission might otherwise confer. This Court must weigh the public interest in punishment and deterrence against any prospects for rehabilitation and the mitigating aspects of your personal circumstances.  

The Court notes the absence of any current employment, housing instability, and the presence of mental health traits which may call for targeted support. These issues cannot be ignored but neither can they be permitted to excuse or minimise the offending. Evidence suggests that you have declined or inconsistently engaged with available services, a factor which diminishes the practical prospects for community-based interventions.  

Having considered all documentary and oral submissions, this Court directs the preparation of a further pre-sentence report incorporating risk assessments, including a consideration of the likelihood of compliance with community orders and the potential benefit of accredited offending behaviour programmes such as “Thinking Skills.” The report should also assess whether structured support addressing housing and financial management can realistically be secured upon sentence.  

The probation service is requested to liaise with local housing providers, substance misuse services, and mental health outreach teams to assess available pathways. I emphasise the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, potentially utilising civil powers where appropriate to complement criminal justice sanctions.  

This Court reserves final sentencing pending receipt and consideration of this detailed report. It is anticipated that the report will provide a fuller evidential basis to inform sentencing options, tailored to the risk and needs presentation. It is also invited to comment upon any restorative justice opportunities that might be viable and appropriate given the nature and impact of your offending.  

Before closing, I wish to acknowledge the contribution of members of the court staff and ushers today, whose professionalism and courtesy continue to facilitate the administration of justice efficiently amidst ongoing challenges, not least the recent refurbishment of this courtroom infrastructure.  

Likewise, I extend thanks to the interpreters and legal team who have ensured this hearing has proceeded without incident. I record that there are no outstanding issues relating to reporting or suppression, and the press are free to report proceedings in accordance with open justice principles.

These are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge R. J. Ellington, issued on this day, 14 September 2026, in Court 6 at Brighton Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is hereby reminded of his right of appeal against sentence within 28 days under section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved. Sentence will be pronounced following consideration of the forthcoming pre-sentence report.  

These are the orders of the court.
