IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/14837  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge R. J. AINSWORTH  
Filed: 18 October 2025  

Mr H, you have appeared before this court charged with offences of theft from retail premises, alleged to have been committed over a protracted period spanning from October 2023 until April 2025. These offences fall within the statutory parameters set out in section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The cumulative effect of this conduct prompts these proceedings, brought within the jurisdiction of this Crown Court and subject to the established sentencing framework applicable to acquisitive offences of this nature.

This court was established as part of the reform of the criminal justice structural map in 1971, following the Royal Commission on Assizes and Quarter Sessions. Since its inception, the Bristol Crown Court has served as a venue where cases of serious criminal conduct receive full judicial scrutiny, with due regard to the principles of justice, proportionality, and public protection. It is in this context that I proceed to address the matter before me.

The genesis of the prosecution lies in a series of complaints and incident reports received from multiple retailers within the South Bristol shopping centre and adjacent high street locations, which had noted suspicious activity consistent with ongoing theft. The business community had previously convened under the auspices of the Bristol Retailers’ Crime Forum to discuss mutual concerns about increasing shrinkage. The forum, comprising local store owners, police representatives, and council officials, acts as a conduit for information sharing and crime prevention strategies. It is worth recognizing that such multi-agency collaborations, while admirable in intent, frequently contend with significant resource constraints and divergent priorities that limit their impact. Notwithstanding this, the investigative efforts into the offences attributed to you benefitted from this framework.

The procedural history in this matter is protracted, albeit in keeping with the numerous steps mandated by contemporary criminal case management. Initial investigation by the Bristol Metropolitan Police Service’s Shoplifting Taskforce commenced in November 2023 following a spike in reported stock discrepancies. Inquiry included collation and analysis of security camera footage, staff witness interviews, and a review of transactional records. The collation of evidence over several months reflects both the complexity of tracking low-level but repeated criminal conduct and the practical limitations faced by law enforcement, who must balance priorities against finite resources.

Police undertook surveillance operations aligned with wider community policing initiatives aimed at reducing “journey crimes,” commonplace in urban retail hubs. It is notable that during the same period, the jurisdiction saw a 12% rise in vehicle-related thefts, according to a report submitted by Ms Jasmine Cole, senior crime analyst. While unrelated to the offending charged here, this statistic illustrates wider pressures on policing priorities and resource allocation.

The investigation was further complicated by the necessity to obtain digital forensic analysis of mobile devices seized pursuant to a warrant, which required liaison with the Electronic Crime Unit of Avon and Somerset Constabulary. This unit, comprising specially trained officers, has faced substantial backlogs due to a nationwide deficit in cyber forensic staffing. The court acknowledges the diligence of the officers involved, who exhibited considerable perseverance in what was a resource-intensive process.

Notably, the Crown pursued early disclosure of extensive CCTV footage and witness statements. This material, disclosed in bundles exceeding 300 pages, was made available to the defence in a timely fashion, commensurate with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 15. However, the case endured various procedural adjournments, one occasion linked to defence counsel’s application to instruct a forensic psychologist specialising in repetitive acquisitive offending. Authority for such instruction required approval by the Legal Aid Agency, which, regrettably, experienced delays in sanctioning the required expenditure.

The Legal Aid Agency’s administrative processes have been the source of mounting concern within the judiciary, as delineated in recent judgments absent here. In R v. Bradford [2024] EWCA Crim 384, the Court of Appeal notably criticized the Agency’s delays in approving expert evidence, admonishing that such friction threatens to impede timely justice. The frustrations expressed by counsel in correspondence filed in this case mirror those commonly encountered.

Attention should also be drawn to the wider societal context in which this offending occurred. It is well documented that in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the retail sector faced significant upheaval, with many stores operating under constrained staffing and reduced operational hours. This environment provided fertile ground for opportunistic offending. Moreover, the cost-of-living crisis, marked by a surge in inflation and utility costs, has exacerbated economic hardship for many, potentially contributing indirectly to increases in acquisitive crime.

The court is mindful, however, that contextual explanation is not synonymous with excusal. The jurisprudence firmly establishes that repeated criminal conduct, even where motivated by financial hardship, demands appropriate sanction.

The facts, as established by the Crown on the balance of probabilities and unchallenged in light of your eventual guilty plea, reveal a pattern of methodical and repeated thefts from multiple outlets. Such conduct, while non-violent, significantly impacts the operations of small businesses and the livelihoods of retail staff.

Relatedly, it is worth noting that repeated exposure to such offending can have deleterious psychological effects on retail workers. A report provided by the Retail Workers’ Welfare Network sets out how persistent low-level theft contributes to workplace stress, feelings of insecurity, and low morale. Several victim personal statements tendered in this case bear testament to these impacts.

This court is similarly conscious of the important role played by voluntary sector organisations in supporting individuals at risk of, or involved in, criminal behaviour. Letters received from the Future Foundations charity commendably highlight the challenges of engaging persons with complex needs who oscillate between periods of stability and relapse. Their workers report acute staffing shortages and funding cuts that have hampered outreach capacity during the period relevant to your offending.

In terms of public protection and rehabilitation, it is relevant that a comprehensive pre-sentence psychiatric evaluation was commissioned and submitted by Dr Harpreet Singh, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose findings I shall address below. The report makes detailed reference to your history and mental state, indicating no diagnosable major mental illness but identifying traits of heightened impulsivity and emotional dysregulation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

A further consideration pertinent to sentencing concerns the risk of reoffending. The probation service’s pre-sentence report, dated 8 October 2025, assesses you as posing a medium risk of serious harm based largely on the likelihood of persistence in acquisitive behaviour absent intervention. Such assessment is informed by static and dynamic risk factors, past offending-related cognition, and responsiveness to prior diversionary schemes. Of note, the report includes observations about your limited engagement with support services despite offer of assistance.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

This court cannot ignore the methodological advances in offender rehabilitation which emphasise the need to address criminogenic needs and provide structured, evidence-based interventions. Programmes such as the Enhanced Thinking Skills Course, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, and substance misuse treatment have demonstrable impact in reducing recidivism. The pre-sentence report broaches the prospect of your participation, subject to suitability.

At the same time, the court acknowledges the systemic pressures upon probation services nationally, including understaffing and high caseload ratios. Commentators have observed that such constraints limit the depth and breadth of supervision and may undermine rehabilitation outcomes. While the court hopes these issues will be alleviated in time, the present circumstances underscore the importance of the individual’s proactive engagement.

Turning, finally, to the sentencing framework, the court notes specifically the Theft Offences Guideline issued by the Sentencing Council, which directs that courts must consider the culpability and harm factors in combination. Aggravating features in your case include the sustained nature of the offending, the deliberate targeting of multiple premises, and the demonstrated awareness of surveillance measures accompanied by conscious evasion.

Mitigation includes your eventual guilty plea, albeit entered close to the trial date—an act that attracts reduced credit. The plea did spare witnesses the ordeal of a contested trial and reflects some acceptance of responsibility. However, it cannot be overlooked that this plea was tendered after the bulk of the Crown’s evidence was assembled and shared with the defence.

The principles established in R v. Devine [2020] EWCA Crim 1012 are relevant here. In that case, the Court of Appeal held that while guilty pleas must be encouraged and appropriately credited, the timing of such pleas is paramount. Late pleas entered at or near trial attract a more limited reduction in sentence. This approach balances the competing interests of justice, victim impact, and the public’s legitimate expectation of efficient resolution.

I also draw on the reasoning in R v. Hartwell [2019] EWCA Crim 1158, which dealt with repeat shoplifting offences where the offender resisted intervention for many months before eventual cooperation. The Court emphasised the importance of addressing repeat offending firmly, particularly when prior community measures had failed to induce change.

Thus, at this juncture, while recognising factors for mitigation, the court’s overarching priority remains the promotion of public safety and deterrence.

Having regard to all the evidence, reports, submissions, and your conduct during the proceedings, I have decided it is appropriate to adjourn sentencing for the purpose of obtaining an updated pre-sentence report that adequately addresses both the risk of reoffending and the potential for intervention. I further require the probation service to consider and report on the feasibility of a condition incorporating an accredited offending behaviour programme tailored to compulsive acquisitive behaviour.
