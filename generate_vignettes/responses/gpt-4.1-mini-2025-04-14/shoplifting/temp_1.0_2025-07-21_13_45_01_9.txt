IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEICESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. 2025/LM6724  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. P. Hawthorne  
Filed: 3 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing following your conviction on a charge concerning theft from retail premises, in breach of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans a protracted period extending from early 2023 through to the spring of 2025, with incidents occurring across various locations within the Leicester metropolitan area, including but not limited to shopping precincts in Humberstone Road and the city centre arcades. The prosecution case has been advanced successfully on the basis of a representative charge, reflecting a series of events rather than isolated acts.  

Procedural Background and Case Progression  
Your case has traversed the customary procedural stages that typify contested Crown Court proceedings of this nature. Initial charge was laid on 4 April 2025, consequent upon a multi-agency investigation which incorporated efforts by the Leicester City Police Business Crime Unit alongside coordinated liaison with the local Retail Crime Partnership. Notably, the Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), established in 2011 pursuant to Home Office guidance, remains an instrumental channel for intelligence gathering and victim support, despite the systemic challenges these bodies increasingly encounter amid funding constraints and staff turnover.  

The Better Case Management protocol, introduced nationally under Part 3 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, was engaged at an early stage. This facilitated the timelier exchange of evidence and identified points of contention for trial preparation. The court duly notes the case’s passage through provisional listing for plea and trial preparation hearings — held on 27 May and 8 July respectively. Of importance, each hearing was marked by the necessary, albeit regrettable, delays attributable principally to the complexities of obtaining legal aid approval for psychological assessment. Such procedural friction is symptomatic of wider systemic pressures within the Legal Aid Agency—an organisation the court has frequently observed as burdened by processing inefficiencies that adversely impact the expeditious administration of justice.  

On 15 August 2025, you entered a plea of guilty to the sole count, albeit at a comparatively late juncture of the proceedings, following the Crown’s provision of accumulative CCTV footage, witness statements, and forensic evidence linked to items recovered from your person upon arrest. This timing is regrettable. It reminds the court of the principles articulated in R v. Jennings [2020] EWCA Crim 1042, where it was held that credit for plea is commensurate not merely with its occurrence but with its promptness and its genuine acceptance of responsibility. Delays in acknowledging culpability carry consequential weight in the exercise of sentencing discretion.  

Parallel exemplar cases, though differing materially from the instant one, provide contextual judicial perspective. R v. Cartwright [2019] EWCA Crim 2031, concerned aggravated burglary of a residential dwelling during the occupiers’ absence on holiday; while entirely unrelated to shoplifting offences, the Court of Appeal underscored therein the necessity to consider aggravating circumstances in evaluating overall culpability. Such authorities serve as peripheral reference points rather than direct precedent here, but echo the enduring legal principle that sentencing must be responsive to the facts in toto.  

At this point, it merits mention the considerable strain on local policing resources occasioned by the cumulative impact of acquisitive crime across urban centres, including Leicester. The diversion of specialist units to what traditional frameworks might categorise as “low-level” offending has unfortunately necessitated increasingly strategic deployment practises, given limited capacity. Officers routinely confront competing priorities ranging from violent crime response to domestic abuse investigations. Such operational realities, while extraneous to your case specifically, form the backdrop against which judicial evaluation rightly takes place.

Incidents of this kind rarely occur purely in isolation. The pattern underpinning your conduct, as carefully documented by investigators through a combination of electronic surveillance and store-level testimonies, exemplifies a persistent engagement in opportunistic dishonesty that challenges assumptions of inadvertence or transitory desperation. It is of course essential to acknowledge that mitigating factors may exist; nonetheless, their relevance is weighed most appropriately against the substantive evidential matrix setting forth the offending behaviour.  

Wider Context — The Role of Social Services and Mental Health Support  
A collateral but significant matter concerns the interface between criminal justice intervention and social care provisions. Mr H has undergone clinical psychological assessment as part of preparations for sentencing, with Dr Zoe Dermott, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, having undertaken a comprehensive evaluation in June 2025. Dr Dermott’s report, circulated to the court and both counsel in advance of today’s hearing, details findings pertinent to impulsivity, affect regulation, and contextual factors including unstable housing and intermittent substance misuse. Though no formal diagnosis of major mental disorder was adjudged, there are references to moderate adjustment difficulties and psychosocial stressors adversely impacting decision-making capacities.  

This finding parallels observations made in R v. Calderwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, where the defendant’s coercive control of a partner was considered alongside her psychological vulnerability, resulting in a nuanced approach to sentencing. While the facts of Calderwood differ substantially, it highlights the judiciary’s increasing attentiveness towards integrated risk assessment encompassing mental health considerations.  

Correspondence from the Leicester Homelessness Prevention team was submitted on behalf of Mr H. Their letter, dated 12 August 2025, outlines prior engagement with the defendant, including referrals for temporary accommodation and financial advisory support. The agency notes, however, that engagement was intermittent and that refusals of offers of assistance were not uncommon. Such disengagement carries implication both for rehabilitation prospects and wider community resources, which this court notes with concern, given the finite availability of support services.  

The court is also aware of the evolving landscape of safeguarding within retail environments. The increased volume of shoplifting offences has prompted several local supermarkets to adopt enhanced staff training on vulnerability recognition and trauma-informed responses. The capacity for frontline workers to manage not only loss prevention but also the attendant psychological impacts — including stress and burnout — must not be underestimated. Representatives from the Retail Workers Union communicated, via letter dated 20 July 2025, their observation that accumulated incidents of theft impose significant strain on staff wellbeing, with implications for turnover and operational stability. Such perspectives, while peripheral to your case per se, inform the contextual gravity with which the court approaches offences of this nature.

I pause to recognise with appreciation the diligent efforts of Detective Sergeant Nathan Clive and his investigative team. Their work, characterised by meticulous data collation, inter-agency coordination, and the navigation of sometimes labyrinthine evidential paths, is emblematic of the professionalism within modern policing that, regrettably, often goes unseen by the public and unremarked in official discourse. The court’s gratitude is extended, even amid the sobering acknowledgement of resources consumed in pursuing matters of this scope.  

A further point of note relates to the case’s listing history and attendant logistical considerations. The hearing initially set for 18 August 2025 was, due to a confluence of operational listing constraints and a short-notice action pursuant to the Court Clerks’ Association dispute over contractual terms, adjourned to today’s date, notwithstanding best efforts to maintain the original timetable. Such industrial action, while justified in its own court, regrettably contributes to systemic delays within an already stretched judicial infrastructure. These procedural idiosyncrasies, extraneous though they are, form the practical reality against which criminal justice is presently administered.

The Court's Sentencing Framework  
The Court’s approach to sentencing in cases of retail theft remains anchored principally to the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences issued in 2016 and updated in 2020. The guideline promulgates a starting point reflective of the offence's seriousness, informed by factors such as the defendant’s culpability, the value of the property stolen, the use of sophistication or planning, prior convictions, and harm occasioned to victims. Although the scale of quantitative loss may appear modest when spread across multiple incidents, the qualitative impact — in terms of loss of amenity, security concerns, and staff distress — is given substantial evaluative weight.  

Notwithstanding, the guideline advises a cautious application of immediate custodial sentences in the majority of shoplifting cases absent aggravating elements such as repeat offending, serious harm, or the use of threats or violence. I must, however, consider each case on its merits, factoring in the extent to which statutory aims of sentencing — deterrence, rehabilitation, public protection, and punishment — can be achieved through non-custodial measures.  

Akin jurisprudence of note includes R v. Latimer [2021] EWCA Crim 947, which concerned repeat and planned shoplifting in a larger retail setting. Though the factual matrix diverges from Mr H’s, the Court of Appeal underscored the import of persistence and premeditation in justifying custodial outcomes. Conversely, in R v. Fielding [2022] EWCA Crim 1128, the Court emphasised the potential for community-focused rehabilitation, particularly where engagement with support services was demonstrated. Such precedents, while distinct, provide the juridical backdrop to sentencing determinations here.  

The defendant’s antecedents merit careful consideration. You are 34 years of age and have four prior convictions, all for theft-related offences, spanning the period from 2017 to 2023. Your last conviction occasioned a conditional discharge, within which you repeatedly contravened behavioural expectations. No previous custodial sentences are recorded, which is a material mitigating feature. Nonetheless, the persistence evidenced reflects an entrenched pattern. The prosecution have highlighted your failure to comply with prior community orders or diversionary programmes — a fact not lightly discounted.

Restorative justice has been explored in this jurisdiction with increasing frequency due to its capacity to facilitate offender accountability and victim reconciliation. The Leicester Victim Support Service engaged with affected premises in respect of the present matter. Letters received from two small business owners, while not requesting reparation, articulate the broader impact upon workforce morale and operational confidence. Such perspectives assist in gauging the wider social harm, beyond the immediate financial cost.

Expert Reports and Psychological Assessment  
Dr Zoe Dermott’s psychological report runs to some twenty pages, replete with standardised testing, clinical interview notes, and observational commentary. She concludes that Mr H does not meet the threshold for a major mental health disorder such as bipolar affective disorder or schizophrenia, nor is there evidence supporting a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. Instead, her findings highlight a constellation of traits evidencing impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and poor coping mechanisms when confronted with uncertainty or financial pressure.  

The report notes a history of sporadic misuse of alcohol and occasional illicit substances, none of which meets criteria for dependence but collectively compound psychosocial instability. Importantly, the psychological narrative does not seek to negate responsibility but contextualises behavioural choice within a framework of reduced decision-making capacity exacerbated by environmental strain.  

The report duly recommends consideration of specialist cognitive behavioural therapy addressing impulsive behaviours and decision-making, alongside structured social support aimed at securing stable accommodation and employment. The court acknowledges these suggestions as integral to addressing potential reoffending risk and enhancing rehabilitative prospects.  

It may be noted that relevant pre-sentence reports from Probation South Leicestershire indicated longstanding difficulty in sustaining compliance with community directives, often attributed to chaotic lifestyle and limited social anchors. Staffing shortages within the Probation Service, particularly those tasked with adult offender supervision, have been publicised extensively in recent reports by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation, underscoring challenges in delivering intensive and responsive interventions. Those systemic difficulties, while not excusing non-compliance, provide background to the hurdles experienced in managing cases like yours.

Public Safety and Community Impact  
The court is mindful of the broader societal context in which shoplifting offences like yours take place. National data indicates a steady rise in acquisitive crime of this nature over the past five years, with complex causative factors including economic volatility, increased social fragmentation, and pressures on housing. The normalisation of casual dishonesty presents insidious risks to community cohesion and public confidence.  

The role of policing is thereby multifaceted: prevention, detection, and enforcement, coupled with fostering community trust. Policing on the ground, however, faces persistent difficulties from resource constraints, rising call volumes, and the competing prioritisation of serious and violent crime investigations. These operational demands are further complicated by the technological burdens of digital forensic examination, which has exponentially increased evidential complexity in recent years.  

The efficacy of co-located multi-agency panels, such as the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARAC) and offender management fora, is constrained by fluctuating funding and organisational capacity. Evidence suggests that in areas where these systems function optimally, repeat offending and associated harm can be reduced. The extent to which such collaboration impacted the present investigation is recorded but does not alter the substantive analysis of your culpability.
