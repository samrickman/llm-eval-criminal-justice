IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. TZ2025/14859  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. K. Bannister  
Filed: 18 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced in connection with offences of shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending in question is the culmination of repeated incidents spanning a period from August 2023 through to April 2025, primarily affecting various retail establishments within the Bristol metropolitan area, including several independent grocers and pharmacy outlets.  

Procedural Overview  
You were initially arrested on 29 April 2025 following a methodical, multi-agency operation involving the Avon and Somerset Constabulary's Acquisitive Crime Unit alongside local authority enforcement officers and security teams operating within the retail sector. The investigation was instigated by a series of intelligence reports received by the Bristol Retail Crime Partnership, which had collated data on a recurring pattern of thefts, principally targeting health and beauty products, nutritional supplements, and confectionery lines. This pattern was linked to what the authorities suspected was a deliberate and organised course of conduct designed to exploit routine store vulnerabilities.  

This case unfolded against a backdrop of increasing strain on policing resources, as ongoing large-scale events, such as the annual Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, commanded substantial operational focus during the summer months of the same year. The local Serious Crime Taskforce, though primarily concentrated on violent and organised crime, provided supplemental intelligence expertise, highlighting the interplay and competition for scarce investigative capacity in metropolitan areas.  

It is useful to recall, at this juncture, the nature of the Better Case Management protocol introduced in 2018 and subsequently refined through the Criminal Procedure Rules amendments of 2022. This framework aims to ensure court listings, evidence disclosure, and case progression milestones are achieved in an efficient and timely manner. Although originally directed at indictable offences presenting forensic complexities, the principles are now widely applied to medium-scale theft cases to alleviate burgeoning court backlogs. Your case was allocated to Crown Court jurisdiction due to the cumulative value and multiplicity of incidents alleged, which exceeded the summary thresholds permissible in Magistrates’ Courts.  

I note with some relief that the case listings have mostly adhered to the expected timetable despite well-documented challenges faced by this court. These challenges have included multiple unplanned adjournments through the last eighteen months due to strike action by the National Union of Court Workers, and local technical failures affecting video link capabilities while awaiting timely expert witness testimony from the Forensic Science Service. These backlogs have been particularly acute in the presentation of CCTV evidence, often the linchpin in retail theft cases, necessitating lengthy review and redaction to comply with the Data Protection Act 2018.  

Initial hearings took place on 6 and then 27 May 2025, during which no pleas were entered. A plea and trial preparation hearing was subsequently convened on 15 July 2025, by which stage you had elected to instruct a solicitor under Legal Aid provision, following protracted administrative approval that had been delayed due to what counsel termed “internal triage requirements” within the Legal Aid Agency. The defence served a notice of intention to plead not guilty originally, prompting the preparation of comprehensive disclosure bundles and witness statements from retail staff and security personnel. The matter was originally set down for trial on 20 August but was adjourned on application of the defence to allow for a full psychiatric assessment, whose report was eventually produced in early September.  

During the hearing on 7 October 2025, you changed your plea to guilty in respect of the representative offence presented in the indictment. This plea was entered shortly before the opening of the trial. The Crown's file comprised extensive CCTV footage, staff statements, and loss prevention incident logs spanning several shops within the Bristol city region.  

I should say, before addressing the substance and context of the offending, that the Crown Prosecution Service may, more than any agency, be familiar with the difficulties inherent in pursuing shoplifting cases. The sheer volume of petty theft reports outstrips the resources available for meaningful follow-up, and success rates in conviction frequently depend on the quality and availability of video surveillance evidence. That the Crown has proceeded to trial reflects a degree of coherence in the evidence base that is not always forthcoming and commends the work of the Bristol Retail Crime Partnership, the Metropolitan Loss Prevention Officers Association, and local police teams for their coordinated response.  

Alongside the institutions just mentioned, I record the valuable input of the Bristol Volunteer Support Network, a collective of local non-governmental organisations providing wraparound support to vulnerable defendants. Their representation on this case involved direct interaction with you over several months, including attempts to facilitate engagement with mental health and housing services. I also note with respect the efforts of the regional Adult Social Care Outreach Team, which seeks to assist in reducing reoffending by addressing underlying psychosocial factors contributing to acquisitive behaviour.  

The court recognises that the resources deployed in this case, while substantial, constitute only one component of the wider societal challenge posed by persistent low-level offending. There is, regrettably, a well-documented national trend in acquisitive offending rates, which is concomitant with complex socioeconomic factors such as rising housing instability, inflationary pressures, and diminished institutional support for those at risk of marginalisation. The operational response, by necessity, requires multi-agency cooperation to ensure not only justice but also safeguarding outcomes are adequately balanced.  

I must also observe the recurrent frustrations expressed in defence submissions and by court staff about the administrative capacity of the Legal Aid Agency. Delays, inconsistencies in guideline application, and funding refusals for expert reports constitute matters of ongoing and serious concern. As with previous cases, such as R v. Malone [2024] EWCA Crim 931, it is evident that these bureaucratic obstacles can materially impede the progress of cases and, at worst, impact on the equitable administration of justice. This court joins the chorus of judicial voices calling for clear reforms and enhanced accountability within this vital public service domain.  

Turning, then, to the relevant legal framework, the Theft Act 1968, as amended, remains the defining statute. Section 1 makes clear that the dishonest appropriation of property with intent permanently to deprive is unlawful. In shoplifting contexts, there are well-established sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council, which recognise the peculiarly insidious nature of repeated retail theft because of its cumulative financial and psychological impact on small businesses and frontline retail workers.  

Previous appellate authority affirms the starting points for sentences in medium and high culpability cases. For example, R v. Tasker [2021] EWCA Crim 1754 emphasised that persistent theft characterised by planning and exploitation of staff vulnerabilities warrants immediate custodial sanctions to uphold public confidence and deter recidivism. Equally relevant is R v. Grayson [2019] EWCA Crim 1263, which acknowledged circumstances permitting non-custodial sentences where there is demonstrable engagement with rehabilitation services and genuine insight.  

I have also carefully considered the observations in R v. Pritchard [2022] EWCA Crim 1762, where the Court of Appeal considered the impact of late guilty pleas. The guiding principle remains that credit is primarily a reflection of genuine remorse and an early acceptance of responsibility. When pleas are delayed until trial, discount levels necessarily fall, reflecting both the practical disruption caused to prosecution and the emotional toll on witnesses who must prepare for contested proceedings.  

Equally, I have taken account of the often-cited dictum from R v. Martyn [2018] EWCA Crim 1251, which cautions judges not to conflate personal circumstances as mitigation where they do not bear directly on culpability or prospect of rehabilitation. Each case, however, must be assessed on its individual facts, with greater weight accorded to those matters more properly material to sentencing justification.

I note that the offending involved a pattern of conduct characterised by systematic concealment of goods, apparent awareness of store security measures, and, in some respects, a degree of brazen confidence. Notwithstanding the absence of violence or direct threats, the effect on store staff and management was substantial, as reflected in victim personal statements.  

The behavioural traits displayed include what the probation report describes as “calculated risk-taking” and “routine exploitation of transient vulnerabilities in retail environments.” While this formula is, sadly, not unfamiliar, it nonetheless undermines public confidence and contributes materially to the rising costs of retail security—costs which are inevitably passed on to consumers and taxpayers alike.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The cumulative financial loss detailed in several reports amounts to several hundreds of pounds per incident, with aggregate losses approximating £3,600 over the period concerned. Most of these losses were borne by small businesses operating on tight margins, many of whom rely heavily on volunteer staff or family members, underscoring the disproportionate impact of what on the surface might appear as minor thefts.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

A further aspect of the offending was the reported interference with security devices, including tampering with electronic article surveillance tags in at least four separate incidents. This persisted despite repeated warnings and the presence of shop-floor deterrents. Such conduct, reflecting a degree of premeditation, weighs heavily in assessing the overall culpability.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Victim impact statements submitted by proprietors describe heightened anxiety, disrupted work patterns, and in one instance, the resignation of a staff member citing concerns about personal safety and job stress following repeated encounters with yourself. While no physical altercation ensued, the emotional and psychological consequences bear significant weight.

You are not a stranger to the criminal justice system. Your record reveals a sequence of convictions primarily related to shoplifting and low-level acquisitive offences stretching back to 2017. Notably, you have previously been subject to a conditional discharge in 2021 following a community resolution for a similar pattern of offending. That prior disposition included mandatory participation in diversionary programmes, with explicit warnings about future consequences in the event of reoffending.

Expert Psychiatric and Probation Reports  
Dr Arjun Mehta, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, was instructed by the defence to prepare a report addressing mental health and related risk factors. His assessment, dated 3 September 2025, concluded that you do not meet the criteria for a major psychiatric diagnosis. However, the report identifies personality features consistent with borderline traits, alongside impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and episodic substance misuse, primarily alcohol-related. These findings, while not constituting formal disorder, may contribute to behavioural difficulties.  

The consultant also notes a history of childhood adversity, including exposure to parental substance misuse and frequent moves during formative years. These background factors resonate with vulnerabilities commonly observed among repeat offenders, but the nexus to culpability remains indirect. Importantly, there is no evidence of psychosis, cognitive impairment, or active suicidal ideation at present.  

The Probation Service submitted a detailed report dated 10 October 2025, noting your limited engagement with community support networks despite offers from multiple agencies. It highlights the absence of steady employment or stable housing, which has compounded existing difficulties. The report recommends that any sentence imposed include requirements addressing cognitive behavioural therapy and substance misuse treatment, tailored to support desistance and reduce reoffending risk.  

Additional multi-agency correspondence includes letters from the Bristol Community Outreach Support Service and the Safe Housing Initiative, both of which emphasise the importance of integrating wraparound care with criminal justice interventions for individuals in your situation. A support worker from the Safe Housing Initiative kindly provided an address indicating your recent periods of temporary accommodation in Bristol city centre, further complicating consistent attendance at scheduled appointments.

It is appropriate at this stage to reflect on the broader context. Across England and Wales, retail theft accounts for a substantial component of acquisitive crime statistics, and the consequences extend well beyond the immediate loss of goods. Staff morale, employee retention, community confidence, and the economic viability of local businesses are all adversely impacted. The cumulative operational burden placed on police, courts, and support services is immense.  

We are living in a time when the frequency of shoplifting offences is rising in several urban centres. This cannot be divorced from wider social phenomena, including the growth in street homelessness, substance dependency, and unaddressed mental health issues. Many retail theft cases conceal a background of social deprivation and unmet needs that the professionals in this jurisdiction are all too familiar with. Nonetheless, the courts must balance compassion with the fundamental obligation to uphold the rule of law and protect the public interest.  

I reiterate my gratitude to all those involved in the meticulous preparation of this case. This includes the officers of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, whose diligence in liaising with retail partners deserves commendation. I also thank the witness coordinators and judicial clerks who manage the increasingly complex demands of offender and victim attendance. This courtroom itself has recently undergone refurbishment, including the installation of updated audio-visual equipment facilitating more efficient presentation of CCTV materials. This technological investment tangibly improves case management and evidential clarity, to which I draw attention as an example of the continuous evolution of court infrastructure.  

On the matter of mitigating factors, I recognise your expressed acceptance of responsibility upon pleading guilty. While this plea was entered late in proceedings, it remains a factor entitled to some degree of consideration. However, such credit cannot be equated with an early admission which might have spared the distress of witnesses and reduced court time.  

You have submitted several letters from family members and community figures as evidence of character and potential support networks. These have been received and read with due consideration. While expressions of support are always welcome, they must be weighed against the pattern of offending, the absence of sustained engagement with rehabilitation services, and the ongoing risk posed to vulnerable retail staff and businesses.  

I also acknowledge the dedicated efforts of local voluntary organisations who have offered you assistance in areas including food security, housing advice, and psychological support. That such efforts have not produced lasting engagement is disappointing, but not uncommon in cases involving fluctuating commitment and chaotic lifestyles.  

It is instructive to consider, albeit tangentially, the lessons of R v. Sinclair [2020] EWCA Crim 1893, a case involving unlicensed waste disposal and environmental damage. Although wholly unrelated to theft, this decision emphasised that persistent disregard for statutory norms, even in non-violent offences, demands firm judicial response. It supports the principle that public trust is eroded by repeated breaches of conduct, whatever the offending sphere.  

Similarly, the Court’s approach in R v. Morgan [2023] EWCA Crim 1402, involving possession of a bladed article in a school car park, underscores the heightened sensitivity required when public safety and communal trust are compromised. While that case involved different facts and different risks, the sentencing principles relating to deterrence and protection have parallels here.  

Turning to a case closer in nature, R v. Pike [2019] EWCA Crim 1764 dealt with acquisitive crime where the defendant repeatedly engaged in shoplifting across multiple towns, exploiting vulnerable elderly staff. The decision reinforced that cumulative offending, coupled with disregard for prior warnings, warrants custodial sentences in the majority of cases.  

In your instance, the impact on smaller independent businesses in Bristol’s retail sector is palpable and aggravating. Many such enterprises are already economically fragile, and theft further destabilises their position.  

I must also take into account the fact that, notwithstanding previous opportunities to reform, you have persisted in offending behaviour, with intervening episodes of ‘diversionary’ programmes failing to elicit meaningful change. Your situation illustrates the challenges posed by repeat offenders, particularly those presenting with complex psychosocial profiles that include but are not limited to impulsivity and substance misuse.  

While remorse may now be professed, it is regrettably tempered by the history of previous similar conduct, which tempers the prospects of rehabilitation without sustained and robust intervention. Accordingly, any sentence must reflect not only punishment but also provide a framework for structured support.  

The court remains mindful of the importance of proportionality, and of the overarching need to impose a sentence that is both just and conducive to national sentencing consistency. I have consulted the Sentencing Council’s theft guideline published in November 2021 and relevant statutory provisions, including the Criminal Justice Act 2003 regarding sentencing principles.  

The value of victims’ input is acknowledged, and their expressions of loss and distress cannot be understated. Protracted absences of key staff or the costs associated with additional security measures are not trivial inconveniences but material harms.  

Before concluding, I convey thanks to counsel appearing today for their thorough and professional presentations. Miss Fiona Ellis appears on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service and has displayed a commendable grasp of both evidence and the wider statutory context. Mr Owen Griffiths represents the defence, appearing under a Legal Aid representation order. His submissions have been carefully considered.  

I also offer thanks to the court ushers and administrative staff who have ensured that hearings have proceeded without undue delay, despite occasional technical difficulties with the audio-visual presentation systems. The reliable provision of interpreter services, though not required in this case, continues to be a critical component of court access.  

Sentencing is adjourned pending receipt of an updated pre-sentence report, which the Probation Service is instructed to prepare as a matter of urgency. This report should take into account the range of available rehabilitative interventions including cognitive skills training, substance misuse programmes, and potential community payback requirements. I also direct consideration of housing support needs and liaising with community mental health services to enhance prospects for reintegration.  

The court emphasises the centrality of a holistic approach that balances accountability with opportunities for positive change, recognising that persistent low-level offending presents particular challenges for courts, probation practitioners, and social services alike.  

This concludes my sentencing remarks in respect of the matters before me today. I remind you, Mr H, of your legal rights, including the right to appeal any sentence within 28 days, pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Any reporting restrictions applicable under Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are noted as not engaged in this instance.  

These proceedings were conducted in open court, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. A written transcript has been prepared in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules and will form part of the official court record. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
