IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/13456  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. P. Harborne  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court charged under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 with offences relating to the unlawful appropriation of goods from various retail premises in the Brighton and Hove district over a protracted period extending from early 2023 to the spring of this year. This pattern of offending, which we shall discuss in due course, has given rise both to significant community concern and police resource allocation.  

Procedural History  
Your arrest followed an investigation initiated by the Brighton Retail Crime Unit, a joint task force comprised of officers from the Sussex Police Economic Crime Section alongside representatives from the local authority’s Business Crime Reduction Partnership. This multi-agency body was convened in response to a moderate but persistent increase in retail thefts targeting small and medium-sized independent traders near the city centre and surrounding suburbs. The partnership utilises pooled data from loss prevention teams, council licensing officers, and frontline policing to identify clusters of acquisitive crime and formulate tactical responses.  

The investigation that culminated in your arrest unfolded over several months and involved the cross-referencing of store incident logs, CCTV footage, and witness statements collected through voluntary cooperation by a network of retailers. It is important to acknowledge here that such investigations are characteristically labour-intensive and implicate considerable expenditure of public funds and operational hours. The demands placed upon police officers in managing these “low level” offences, as they are sometimes dismissively termed, belie their collective impact and the societal interest in maintenance of commercial and community order.  

The Better Case Management (BCM) scheme under the Criminal Procedure Rules provides a procedural framework designed to expedite the resolution of such prosecutions, reducing unnecessary delays and unnecessary burdens upon court resources. Your case has, throughout, been subject to BCM timetabling, with listings for plea and trial preparation hearings held in accordance with prescribed intervals. Such progression is not always the norm, especially in cases involving defendants unable or unwilling to engage promptly with legal representation. In this regard, the court notes that your legal team, instructed under a Legal Aid representation order, have complied diligently with scheduling demands despite some administrative friction encountered during the funding process.  

Your initial plea was entered at the plea and trial preparation hearing conducted on 12 August 2025. At that juncture, you pleaded not guilty. However, following the disclosure of additional forensic and witness evidence, a change of plea to guilty was entered on the morning of the first trial listing on 7 September 2025.  

The law on credit for guilty pleas is well established and bears repeating. The timing of the plea is a critical factor in the assessment of mitigation. Credit is granted in recognition of savings in court time and expenditure of public resources and the sparing of victims and witnesses the ordeal of trial. The earlier the plea, the greater the credit. The Court of Appeal in R v. Rogers [2020] EWCA Crim 1423 emphasised that a plea entered only at trial, or shortly before, should attract reduced discount compared to one made at the earliest opportunity. This principle maintains the proper balancing of encouragement for early admissions with the safeguarding of defendants’ procedural rights.  

The Court is also mindful of the observations in R v. Sanderson [2021] EWCA Crim 533, which concerned a wholly different category of offence – namely aggravated burglary – but reaffirmed the broad applicability of these principles across criminal practice.  

In anticipation of sentencing, the court has received a pre-sentence report commissioned from the Sussex Probation Service, who have inspected your previous record, assessed your personal circumstances, and outlined proposals for rehabilitation. Further expert evidence has been provided by Dr Fiona McLeod, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose report addresses relevant mental health considerations.  

It is necessary, before engaging with the particulars of your offending, to acknowledge certain persistent systemic difficulties faced by criminal justice agencies in addressing acquisitive crime such as this. The chronic underfunding and staffing shortages afflicting the probation service, police force, and community support organisations are well documented. Cases of this nature often expose the fault lines in provision of timely intervention, enforcement, and follow-up, especially given the competing demands posed by more serious and violent crime types. That is not to diminish the importance of such offences, but to situate this matter within a broader institutional context.  

Moreover, the use of technology in detecting and preventing retail theft – including CCTV, electronic article surveillance, and store-level intelligence – continues to evolve at a pace the court vindicates as both promising and complicated. The proliferation of devices and digitised recording means that courts frequently encounter evidence types demanding specialised handling. The evidentiary weight of such sources may be substantial but is counterbalanced by technical limitations, privacy considerations, and procedural safeguards demanding careful judicial oversight.  

It cannot be overlooked that instances of acquisitive offending, though often categorised within a low-harm paradigm, collectively exert significant pressure on public services as well as on their individual victims. Retail employees, particularly in independent stores, endure psychological distress and awkwardness as a result of repeated theft, which may manifest in staff turnover, decreased morale, and restructuring of workplace practices such as lone working policies or the reorganisation of merchandise layout.  

At the case management hearing held at Brighton Crown Court on 19 July 2025, the court heard from Ms Elizabeth Granger, representing the Retail Crime Reduction Partnership, who provided an account of coordinated efforts directed towards improving reporting channels and victim support mechanisms. This testimony served to underline the importance of collaborative frameworks.  

Additionally, correspondence received from the Charlotte House Shelter, a local organisation supporting individuals facing homelessness and substance misuse, detailed their attempts to liaise with you in the months preceding your arrest. The court views such third-sector engagement as an indispensable element in the complex matrix of community safety and rehabilitation work. The submission expressed cautious optimism that you might benefit from structured social supports.  

Turning to case law of tangential but notable relevance, I reference R v. Whitaker [2019] EWCA Crim 2115 in which the Court of Appeal dealt with sentencing for a defendant convicted of fly-tipping waste illegally in a green belt area. While factually distinct, the principle of proportionality and the need to calibrate sentencing in light of environmental and regulatory harm were central. That reasoning underscores the importance of contextualising offending behaviour within its impact footprint – an approach equally justified in theft matters.  

Similarly, the judgment in R v. Fleming [2023] EWCA Crim 718 concerned affray arising from a pub brawl involving the use of pool cues. That case primarily illuminates the court’s analytical approach to public disorder and the aggravating factors arising from weapon usage and premeditation. Though unrelated to the present facts, such jurisprudence enriches the legal landscape informing this court’s sentencing discretion.  

A brief note is made concerning the recent refurbishment of Courtroom 4 at Brighton Crown Court, which provides upgraded digital recording facilities and improved access. Although peripheral to this matter, such investments contribute positively to the administration of justice and are to be welcomed. The court also acknowledges the diligent work of court ushers and administrative staff, whose contributions to maintaining order and assisting parties deserve recognition on every sitting day.  

The facts of this matter—as relevant to your role—are as follows:

Additional evidential material comprises the detailed compilation of CCTV footage reviewed by Detective Sergeant Callum Ingram, whose notes confirm multiple instances establishing your presence at various premises coinciding with episodes of theft.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

Of note, particular attention was drawn to an incident recorded at the Cheriton Supermarket, where your method involved concealing merchandise under an oversized jacket, an approach documented in prior cases as indicative of planning. The ring-fencing of such incidents is necessary for proper case analysis.  

In relation to your personal circumstances, the probation service has reported that you are currently 34 years of age and reside in temporary accommodation arranged via the Brighton Housing Department. You have a limited employment history, punctuated by sporadic engagement in seasonal work and documented periods of unemployment.  

Dr McLeod’s psychiatric evaluation provides that there is no evidence of a major mental illness; nevertheless, she notes reactive symptoms consistent with chronic anxiety and features of borderline personality traits, including impulsivity and interpersonal instability. While these are of clinical interest, they do not absolve accountability or responsibility in relation to the offending behaviour.  

A further procedural note concerns the regrettable delay occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency in authorising your counsel’s request for an independent forensic accountant to evaluate potential unexplained sources of income. Despite an original application date of 15 July 2025, funding was not confirmed until 1 September 2025, thereby compressing preparation times and contributing to adjournments. This serves as a lamentable example of systemic inertia that affects defence readiness.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Attention is drawn to the reported absence of co-defendants in these matters; although the police identified another individual allegedly involved in related offences, that person remains absent from proceedings having failed to answer bail and is presently sought by law enforcement.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

Victim impact statements have been obtained from multiple independent retail owners affected by your offences. One such statement comes from Ms Angela Tomlinson, manager of the Bayside Pharmacy, who detailed the psychological strain placed on staff who, despite having no formal training in conflict resolution, have faced persistent anxieties about personal safety and potential escalation. A submission from the Brighton Retail Workers’ Association highlights increased sick leave and turnover attributable in part to the stress exposure associated with repeat theft incidents.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

The presence of local outreach programmes, including the Brighton Community Safety Team, has now for some time been a feature of the wider strategy to mitigate street-level acquisitive crime. Their report to this court emphasises commendable advances in inter-agency communication, notably with the Sussex Probation Service and the Business Crime Partnership.  

It is pertinent to mention R v. Maloney [2018] EWCA Crim 652, which concerned possession of a bladed article in the car park of a secondary school. Though entirely unrelated in substance and unrelated to your conduct, that judgement enshrined the principle of the court’s zero tolerance for weapon-related offences near sensitive establishments.  

By way of further illustration, the case of R v. Carter [2022] EWCA Crim 1769 dealt with the importation of Class A drugs concealed within modified freight parcels shipped to addresses in East London. The sophistication and scale of the trafficking operation attracted lengthy custodial sentences. While none of those features are present here, the case underscores the disparity between different classes of offending.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

Returning to the personal sphere, the probation report notes that you have disengaged from voluntary support services, including a local food bank and a housing advice centre, suggesting limited motivation to address underlying issues contributing to your offending cycle.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

The report also outlines your substantial prior history of convictions for shoplifting, spanning more than six years, with a noted failure to adhere to community-based orders imposed in 2021 and 2023. There is no indication of current substance misuse above recreational levels, but your counsel submits, and the report concurs, that instability in living arrangements contributes to ongoing risk factors.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

The repeated nature of your offending highlights a defiance of earlier intervention attempts, including formal warnings and restorative justice initiatives.  

In paragraph 2.4 of its 2022 annual review, the Sussex Probation Service expressed concern about the marked increase in breaches of community orders nationally, exacerbated by pandemic-related restrictions, reduced face-to-face contact, and resource limitations. Of particular note is the report’s acknowledgement of the need for enhanced thinking-skills programmes tailored to offenders exhibiting persistent acquisitive crime.  

R v. Dearing [2024] EWCA Crim 1098 provides instructive dicta relevant here, underscoring the court’s obligation to balance the rehabilitative potential of community sentences against the protective requirement arising from repeat dishonesty. Dearing reaffirmed that recidivism in shoplifting may warrant immediate custody when prior community interventions have demonstrably failed.  

Sentencing Principles and Considerations  

This court proceeds mindful of the statutory framework under the Sentencing Act 2020, alongside the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline for theft offences issued in 2021. The overarching aim remains the reduction of reoffending through proportionate and structured responses, including custody suspended when feasible, community sentences with rehabilitative elements, or custodial sentences where necessary to protect the public.  

Seriousness factors in this case include the pattern and persistence of offending, the specific targeting of vulnerable traders, the demonstrated planning and manipulation of store environments to facilitate theft, and the psychological impact recounted by victims. Mitigation arises primarily from your guilty plea, albeit late, and the absence of violence or threats.  

The court will, at the forthcoming sentencing hearing, take careful account of the pre-sentence report and examine the suitability of proposed programmes such as the Integrated Offender Management (IOM) initiative and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) modules designed to address impulsivity and criminal thinking. Consideration will also be given to any potential requirement for unpaid work and financial reparation.  

I acknowledge the input provided in writing by the local charity Safe Harbour, whose mission is to reduce the harm of acquisitive crime through education and support for victims. They advocate strongly for community-based sentences in appropriate cases, citing research on the efficacy of sustained engagement over custodial sentences for offenders of this profile.  

At this juncture, I express gratitude to Ms Olivia Fletcher, appearing on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr James Trevelyan, who acts on your behalf by legal aid. I note, with regrettable familiarity, the continuing frustrations occasioned by pro
