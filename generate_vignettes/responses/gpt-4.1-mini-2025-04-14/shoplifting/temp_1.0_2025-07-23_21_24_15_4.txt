IN THE CROWN COURT AT STRATFORD  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13529  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. A. Fairclough  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear for sentence following your conviction for theft, specifically a course of conduct involving shoplifting from a variety of retail premises across the Stratford and neighbouring boroughs. The charge is brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 and reflects a series of incidents spanning a period from November 2023 through to June 2025.

Procedural History and Overview  
The case before the court arose after an extended investigation instigated by a coalition of the Stratford Retail Crime Prevention Unit and the Metropolitan Police’s Acquisitive Crime Taskforce. The investigation was predicated on an observed pattern of losses at multiple retail outlets, notably convenience stores, pharmacies, and small department stores. Initially treated as individual, isolated incidents, the anomalies coalesced through careful collation of CCTV footage, staff statements, and point-of-sale discrepancies indicating a consistent modus operandi matching the movements of an individual later identified as yourself.

I must acknowledge the professionalism of those involved across various agencies, including the business crime liaison officers who contributed victim impact statements, drawing attention to the significant operational challenges arising from persistent shop theft. It merits note that in modern policing structures, such investigations are often challenged by resource constraints, compounded by rising pressures on frontline policing, particularly in urban centres faced with fluctuating crime patterns. The Stratford Retail Partnership, despite limited funding, has acted with tenacity in collating information and maintaining engagement with affected businesses, a commendable though increasingly burdensome role.

Your arrest occurred on 18 July 2025 following targeted surveillance and coordination between uniformed officers and covert units. The temporal proximity between the cessation of the offences in June and your apprehension in July reflects a diligent approach that balanced the necessity for evidential precision against operational risk. The decision to proceed to Crown Court jurisdiction followed upon legal advice and a careful review of the evidential sufficiency.

The case management hearings proceeded in line with the expectations of the Criminal Procedure Rules, albeit not without delay—in part attributable to challenges in legal representation and further complicated by a short period of industrial action affecting court staff in the early summer. These delays, while regrettable, were managed so as not to unduly prejudice your rights or impede the orderly progression of the case. I record my gratitude to the court officers for their dedication under pressure.

At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 25 August, you initially indicated a not guilty plea. Following receipt of additional disclosure, including expert analysis of recovered clothing and further witness statements, you entered a guilty plea on 30 September, the eve of the arraignment list. It is appropriate to observe at this juncture the court’s residual disappointment at the lateness of the plea, which, although within your rights, falls short of the early plea standard that this jurisdiction seeks to encourage.

I take this opportunity to remind all parties of the established principle, reflected in the observations of the Court of Appeal in R v. Siddiqui [2020] EWCA Crim 1427, that while late guilty pleas attract some reduction in sentence, the extent of any discount must be tempered by the timing and circumstances of the admission. The underlying policy is to incentivise early recognition of wrongdoing, thereby sparing victims the anxiety of trial, conserving public resources, and signaling genuine contrition.

The court further notes the contribution of the Defence Solicitor, Mr James Fowkes, and the Crown Advocate, Ms Imogen Watts, both of whom have maintained robust professional standards throughout the proceedings. The ongoing difficulties with Legal Aid administration must not be overlooked, however. The funding application for a forensic behavioural expert, submitted in April, encountered protracted delays resulting in a compromised window for the expert’s consultation and report. Such systemic issues, as remarked upon in R v. Evans [2023] EWCA Crim 334, frustrate the efficient administration of justice and place considerable burdens on defendants and practitioners alike. This court hopes for expeditious reforms in the near future.

Legal Framework and Relevant Authority  
The offence of theft remains one of the most frequently encountered in criminal jurisprudence, its essential elements set out in the Theft Act 1968. The section 1 offence demands the prosecution prove dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive.

Sentencing guidelines provided by the Sentencing Council for theft offences, last updated in 2021, stress the importance of considering the degree of planning, the value of the property stolen, impact upon victims, the offender’s culpability, and any mitigating or aggravating features. Cases of sustained offending, particularly where there is evidence of premeditation or targeting of vulnerable businesses, fall towards the higher end of the custodial threshold.

The judiciary’s approach to sentencing theft offences has been shaped by a series of appellate decisions. For instance, R v. Williams [2019] EWCA Crim 602 addressed the question of whether multiple low-value offences cumulatively warrant a custodial sentence, with the Court confirming that persistent and repeated thefts may warrant immediate custody due to the impact on victims and public confidence.

Similarly, R v. Hastings [2022] EWCA Crim 1412 involved a defendant convicted of orchestrated shoplifting involving distraction techniques and concealment of high-value goods. The court upheld a sentence of 14 months custody, highlighting the harm caused to retail staff and the resultant economic losses.

Turning to diversionary mechanisms, I refer to the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme, which seeks to streamline early disclosure and encourage timely plea resolution. Although your case ultimately required detailed evidential collation across multiple jurisdictions, the process was managed in compliance with BCM protocols.

The issue of psychiatric and psychological assessment in shoplifting cases continues to arise frequently. There is a body of case law, including R v. Crane [2017] EWCA Crim 1673, which emphasises that while underlying mental health issues are material considerations, they do not obviate the need for punitive measures where offending is deliberate and sustained.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

This court also takes note of the observations made in R v. Spencer [2021] EWCA Crim 1234, relating to the importance of tailoring sentences to promote rehabilitation, and the recognition that acquisition-related offending often intersects with financial instability, substance misuse, or social exclusion.

Contextual and Societal Commentary  
We find ourselves in a time marked by increasing strain upon public services. Local authorities, stretched by funding constraints and burgeoning demand, face challenges in housing provision and homelessness prevention. Anecdotal evidence from social care teams points to a troubling rise in individuals falling through safety nets, exacerbating vulnerability to both exploitation and offending.

The court is cognisant that acquisitive crime is often a symptom, rather than solely a cause, of underlying social malaise. However, it is important to delineate the boundaries between sympathy and condonation. The criminal justice system must navigate the delicate balance between acknowledging social determinants of crime and upholding the rule of law.

It is also worth remarking on the increasing burden faced by retail staff, many of whom work in underpaid, insecure roles, yet bear disproportionate exposure to the consequences of theft — including abuse, intimidation, and the erosion of livelihood security. Their testimonies, contained in victim impact statements, recount experiences of anxiety, heightened vigilance, and a sense of violation. These cumulative impacts, though often intangible, resonate deeply within communities.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

In recent reports, such as those produced by the Retail Consortium and echoed in Parliamentary inquiries, there has been expressed concern over the normalization of shop theft amidst economic pressures and shifting social attitudes. While the court does not purport to legislate morality, it must reflect the broader societal commitment to maintaining public order and the integrity of commercial enterprises upon which local economies depend.

The Role of Charitable and Voluntary Organisations  
I wish also to record the substantial and often underappreciated contributions of various voluntary sector bodies in supporting both victims and offenders. Organisations such as the Trade Retail Support Alliance and the Safe Shelves Initiative provide invaluable resources — from victim support to practical rehabilitation services.

For example, correspondence from the Stratford Foodbank and Welfare Trust emphasises the complexity of need often encountered amongst individuals appearing before the courts for minor acquisitive crimes, highlighting intersecting issues of food insecurity, housing instability, and untreated health problems.

Similarly, the local probation service continues to face severe staffing shortages, a fact reflected in recent Ministry of Justice reports which highlight increased caseloads and the consequent risk to effective supervision and rehabilitation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

Such systemic pressures underscore the importance of comprehensive sentencing approaches, which incorporate community-based interventions where appropriate, but also recognise the limitations imposed by resource constraints.

Psychiatric and Probation Reports  
The psychiatric evaluation commissioned on your behalf, undertaken by Dr Helena Muir, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, is a meticulously prepared and detailed document. Dr Muir notes the absence of major psychiatric pathology but identifies traits consistent with impulsivity and low frustration tolerance. There is no evidence of psychosis or major mood disorder. The report candidly discusses your inconsistent engagement with services and the challenges posed by cognitive distortions linked to your offending behaviour.

Dr Muir’s conclusions, while cautious about over-pathologising, point to potential benefit from structured community interventions focusing on behavioural modification, emotional regulation, and vocational training.

The probation officer’s pre-sentence report further elaborates on your background. You are aged 34, with a history of unstable employment and occasional periods of homelessness. You have prior convictions for shoplifting, dating back to 2018, with a recent community resolution recorded in 2023 for a related offence.

The report highlights limited family support and notes ambivalence towards rehabilitative efforts to date. Importantly, the probation service observes a moderate risk of further offending if left unaddressed, particularly in the context of ongoing financial pressures.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

The present case thus presents a complex matrix of factors, necessitating an approach that balances public protection, rehabilitation, and proportionality.

Details of the Offending Behaviour  
The facts of the offending conduct, as gathered through police investigations, witness statements, and forensic evidence, paint a picture of deliberate and methodical thefts conducted over an extended period.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

In several instances, items taken included over-the-counter medicines, personal care products, and household goods — items of relatively modest individual value but cumulatively significant loss.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

The offences were committed during varying times of day, often coinciding with shifts known to be staffed by fewer employees. CCTV footage indicates tactical behaviour such as concealment of goods, distraction of staff, and use of disguises. In one location, a decoy was observed engaging staff while you entered secured areas.

Impact on Victims and Businesses  
Victim impact statements submitted by affected retailers describe both financial and psychological harm. While no physical violence was employed, the repeated intrusion has caused distress and undermined staff confidence.

For instance, the manager of the Greenway Pharmacy deposes to a marked increase in employee stress levels, prompting alterations to staffing rotas and the introduction of additional security measures at considerable expense.

Similar accounts emerge from small business proprietors who report quantifiable losses but also intangible damage in the form of reduced customer confidence and increased fear of repeat offending.

Although such crime may seem minor from a purely transactional perspective, its corrosive effects on communities and commerce are substantial.

Further Procedural Observations  
The sentencing process has been affected by the multiplicity of agencies involved. Multi-agency collaboration, while essential in such cases, introduces complexity in evidence management, victim liaison, and co-ordination of supportive services.

Additionally, the court acknowledges ongoing challenges with the digital forensic capacity of local policing. The workload of the Stratford Cybercrime Unit, responsible for analysis of CCTV and mobile phone data, has increased exponentially in recent years, creating delays in report preparation.

Operations involving triangulation of mobile phone data, digital wallet analysis, and social media monitoring — undertaken with judicial warrants — represent significant deployment of public resources. Though such measures did not feature prominently in this case, similar investigations elsewhere have mandated prolonged allocation of skilled staff, drawing resources from other operational priorities.

Other Judicial Considerations and Analogous Cases  
It is apposite to note, by way of analogy, the decision in R v. Faraday [2018] EWCA Crim 1014, where persistent shoplifting focussing on a regional supermarket chain resulted in a 12-month immediate custodial sentence, reflecting the sustained nature and impact of the offences.

Further, R v. Galloway [2019] EWCA Crim 1142 considered the issue of recovery of stolen goods and the offender’s attempts to cash in items via secondary markets, aggravating the culpability and public harm of the offending.

While not identical in circumstances, these cases provide useful jurisprudential context.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1} — noted earlier — continues to underpin the court’s assessment.

It is also relevant to observe the impact of local community initiatives, such as the Eastwood Business Crime Forum and Stratford Borough’s Safer Neighbourhoods Teams. Their work in co-ordinating responses, providing intelligence, and promoting restorative justice options deserves acknowledgment.

Conclusion and Next Steps  
Having regard to the materials before the court — including the prosecution evidence, defence submissions, psychiatric and probation reports, victim impact statements, and applicable case law — I now adjourn sentencing to secure a final pre-sentence report.

This report should carefully consider the feasibility of community-based interventions, including offender behaviour programmes, unpaid work, and rehabilitation activity requirements, balanced with any custodial thresholds deemed appropriate.

I emphasise that the court’s paramount concern is the robust protection of the public and the maintenance of confidence in the administration of justice.
