IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/17829  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge I. K. FLETCHER  
Filed: 15 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction on a charge relating to multiple offences of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct occurred over a protracted period, from the autumn of 2023 through to early spring 2025, and spanned multiple locations across the Manchester metropolitan area, including district centres and suburban high streets.

Procedural History  
The origins of this prosecution lie in a comprehensive investigation initiated by the Manchester Division of the Greater Manchester Police Business Crime Unit, operating in conjunction with the Manchester Retail Crime Coordination Centre (MRCCC). That unit, established in 2018 to consolidate intelligence gathering and case management across retail premises, particularly small independent outlets, seeks to address the persistent threat posed by repeat acquisitive offenders. The magnitude of data involved was considerable, encompassing digital surveillance footage, electronic point-of-sale reconciliation data, witness statements from retail staff and management, as well as transactional and logistical records compiled over many months. The matter was formally set in motion upon your arrest on 2 March 2025, following a targeted operation which had utilised a range of investigatory tools — including judicially authorised covert surveillance, mobile phone data analysis, and undercover store observations. Although the offences under consideration are sometimes regarded as “low-level” or “non-violent,” the resources committed to the investigation and the consequent impact on public services belies such an impression.

It is necessary to comment here on the pressures facing law enforcement agencies tasked with managing these cases. Resource constraints on specialist crime units have been well documented in parliamentary oversight reports, including the 2024 Home Affairs Select Committee inquiry into acquisitive crime. While officers have commendably adapted by partnering with private security operatives and applying intelligence-led methods, the proliferation of low-level theft nonetheless continues to strain investigative capacity. Officers detailed to such cases frequently spend hundreds of hours collating, verifying, and cross-referencing evidence, a process that detracts from attention to more serious offences. The court notes with regret that these systemic challenges remain unresolved despite frequent calls for enhanced funding and policy revision.

Your case progressed within the framework of the Better Case Management Programme, which remains a cornerstone of judicial case orchestration in the Crown Court. This framework emphasises early disclosure, efficient listing, and the provision of comprehensive case papers to defendant representatives and prosecution alike. The first hearing took place on 27 May 2025, which served as the plea and trial preparation hearing. At that stage, you entered a not guilty plea. The defence subsequently sought a psychiatric evaluation, leading to a brief adjournment. Thereafter, a further hearing was convened on 14 September, where you entered a guilty plea. While the late nature of this plea is not unusual in such proceedings, it is a matter the court will take into account in determining appropriate credit. The pre-sentence report will be instructed in due course.

It is regrettable that your legal team experienced delays in securing authority from the Legal Aid Agency to instruct an independent consultant psychologist. Initial applications were submitted in June but were only approved in mid-July after several rounds of procedural correspondence, resulting in adjournments and protracted preparation times. Such administrative impediments undermine the expeditious progression of cases and impose greater uncertainty and stress on the defendant and all concerned parties. This court reiterates the importance of streamlining such authorisations and urges ongoing reform within the Legal Aid mechanism to prevent recurrences.

The defence has furnished a number of letters from family members and support agencies, including a charity dedicated to housing insecurity and welfare advice, which will be taken into account as may be appropriate. Equally, victim impact statements prepared in collaboration with local business federations and store management bodies have been submitted, detailing the repercussions of your offending on affected individuals and commercial enterprises.

The court would be remiss not to acknowledge the efforts of frontline retail staff, many of whom operate under difficult conditions exacerbated by a pervasive culture of acquisitive offending. Written submissions from the Manchester Retail Workers Union illustrate the psychological toll experienced by employees targeted repeatedly, with some describing anxiety, stress-related absenteeism, and diminished job satisfaction. These factors, while indirect, nonetheless represent real harm and contribute to an atmosphere of insecurity in commercial environments.

Turning to legislation and case law, theft under the Theft Act 1968 remains a foundational offence that incorporates a broad range of conduct, from isolated dishonest acts to systematic and sustained courses of misappropriation. Sentencing remains guided by the principles articulated in the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline for theft offences. As emphasised in the guideline’s foreword, sentencing must reflect the harm caused—both tangible and intangible—the culpability of the offender, and the wider community impact. Aggravating factors such as the targeting of vulnerable premises, repeated offending, use of concealment strategies, and disregard for prior warnings are all germane here.

The court has had regard also to relevant appellate authorities. In R v. Whitmarsh [2019] EWCA Crim 1452, the Court underscored the importance of treating repeat acquisitive offending with seriousness proportionate to the cumulative impact, even where individual thefts are of low monetary value. The judgment reaffirmed that “public protection and the preservation of community confidence” are compelling sentencing objectives. In R v. Elbaz [2022] EWCA Crim 901, the Court reiterated that late guilty pleas offered after the primary evidential case emerges are entitled to reduced credit, mitigating neither the gravity nor consequences of offending.

The facts of the offending are as follows:

It is essential to consider these events within the broader behavioural pattern demonstrated. The evidence presented reveals a consistent approach characterised by strategic targeting of particular products known for resale value, timing offences to coincide with periods of reduced staffing, and the use of various concealment tactics. On repeated occasions, you employed distraction methods — sometimes engaging staff in brief conversations while simultaneously appropriating goods unobserved. Several of the premises involved are known to have suffered from subsequent stock shortages and increased security costs, a burden inevitably passed on to consumers and landlords.

Your actions, while devoid of physical violence, nonetheless generated significant distress among retail personnel. Statements obtained describe heightened anxiety, instances of fear of confrontation, and a diminution in morale. Some employees reported modifying working practices, including the installation of additional security measures and changes to shift patterns, in response to your offending. This suggests not only a financial but also a psychological and operational impact on businesses and their staff.

As the court must acknowledge, repeated theft incidents contribute cumulatively to a pervasive atmosphere of insecurity that undermines community cohesion. While each individual act may appear innocuous, their aggregation amounts to a pattern that cannot be overlooked. It is, moreover, a pattern against which existing policing and retail security efforts struggle to respond adequately due to resource limitations.

The Crown places before the court that despite previous cautions and earlier warnings, your conduct did not desist and indeed escalated, prompting more coordinated multi-agency involvement. A number of community outreach attempts were made, involving local policing teams, social work services, and charitable support organisations. Unfortunately, your engagement with these offers was, at best, intermittent and uncommitted.

Expert Reports and Analysis  
The expert psychiatric report prepared by Dr Rachel Meyer, a consultant forensic psychologist instructed on your behalf, provides a considered evaluation of your mental state, personality structure, and potential for rehabilitation. Dr Meyer’s assessment indicates no formal diagnosis of major psychiatric disorder but notes traits consistent with an impulsive personality type, coupled with emotional dysregulation and intermittent substance misuse. She further observes that your offending is likely linked to socio-economic instability, compounded by unresolved psychosocial stressors. Despite this, your motivation appears primarily instrumental — that is, a pragmatic attempt to alleviate financial precarity rather than a compulsion or disorder-driven act.

The pre-sentence report, prepared by Senior Probation Officer Mr Jonathan Lea, underscores the challenges faced by the Probation Service in managing cases of persistent acquisitive offending, especially amidst widespread staffing shortages and increased caseloads. The report chronicles your previously recorded convictions for similar behaviour, including two prior community orders and a conditional discharge granted in 2021. Officer Lea highlights your sporadic compliance with appointments and reluctance to engage in sustained rehabilitative programmes. The current case is presented as illustrative of these patterns.

Probation services across the Manchester area are stretched to unprecedented levels, grappling with demand that outstrips capacity by approximately 30% according to recent Ministry of Justice figures. Initiatives such as the nationally mandated Integrated Offender Management scheme seek to ameliorate these pressures but remain constrained by budgetary limitations. It is in this environment that the assessment of risk and manageability of offenders like yourself becomes both more vital and more difficult.

The court must also consider victim impact statements submitted by Manchester Retail Federation, which document broader economic consequences including increased insurance premiums, stock losses in excess of tens of thousands of pounds annually, and staff turnover rates linked to stress and morale issues connected with repeat shoplifting incidents. These factors render the crimes more than mere financial abstractions; they constitute real-world harm with economic, social, and psychological dimensions.

Turning to general observations in the wider public domain, one cannot be sanguine about the increase in visible street homelessness and begging within the city centre and its suburbs. Local outreach charities report rising numbers of rough sleepers and individuals facing chronic deprivation compounded by mental health issues and substance dependency. Though no direct causal link can be drawn to your offending conduct, the broader social milieu is undeniably relevant insofar as it influences the context in which crimes such as these occur.

Similarly, recent Home Office statistical bulletins confirm a year-on-year increase in reported shop theft incidents nationally, despite investments in security technology and policing measures. This trend is noted in parliamentary debates, including the recent Justice Select Committee report on “Acquisitive Crime in Urban Areas” (May 2025), which calls for an integrated approach involving early intervention, social support, and targeted enforcement.

Among the unrelated cases that have come before this court in recent months is R v. Collins [2025] MCRC 011, a matter involving aggravated burglary and firearm possession in the Moss Side area. While wholly distinct in nature, that case serves as a sobering reminder of the spectrum of threats confronting local communities. Parallel investigations into serious offences, including drug trafficking and violent disorder, continue to occupy considerable police resources. These contrasting cases emphasise the reality that retail theft, while often appearing minor, contributes nonetheless to the cumulative strain on law enforcement.

Separately, a notable case in the Northern Circuit — R v. Gallagher [2024] NWCA Crim 2123 — concerned a defendant found guilty of causing criminal damage to a community building used for youth services. The defendant’s actions were unrelated to acquisitive offending but have received mention here only as representative of the varied nature of cases managed within the court system, and not as bearing on your circumstances.

It is also pertinent to mention the well-publicised operational difficulties affecting the NHS’s mental health services in recent years, including extended waiting lists for community-based psychological therapies and inpatient provision. Such systemic challenges impact the availability of timely interventions for offenders presenting with mental health vulnerabilities. While no definite diagnosis has been advanced in your case that would mandate hospitalisation or specialist treatment, these background factors demonstrate the complexity of support networks available.

The court is also grateful to record the dedicated work performed by team members of the Manchester Community Outreach Network (MCON), particularly those involved in homelessness prevention and welfare rights advocacy. Their ongoing collaboration with local policing and social services functions as a critical safety net, though capacity constraints have increasingly threatened continuity.

Importantly, it must be said that a number of procedural adjournments in your case reflected the need to resolve forensic evidential questions. For example, initial fingerprint analysis was inconclusive, necessitating further testing. At one hearing, the absence of an interpreter delayed proceedings by over an hour, an occurrence reflective of broader nationwide shortages in qualified linguists and translators available to the courts.

You have provided a letter to the court expressing remorse and a desire to turn your life around. That letter has been carefully considered and reflects a degree of insight, albeit tempered by the timing of its submission, which post-dates the gathering strength of the prosecution case. 

Turning now to sentencing principles, the court must balance the aims set out in section 142 of the Sentencing Act 2020 and the overarching guidelines of the Sentencing Council. Deterrence, both individual and general, rehabilitation, protection of the public, and the denunciation of criminal conduct all weigh heavily in the scales. Your persistent engagement in acquisitive crime over an extended timeframe reflects a pattern of disregard for community standards and an unwillingness to desist despite warnings.

In terms of mitigating considerations, the plea of guilty, though entered late, demonstrates some acceptance of responsibility. Your personal circumstances, including documented housing instability and financial hardship, as well as the absence of any record for violence or intimidation, offer modest mitigation but do not outweigh the aggravating elements.

The court notes that previous community-based disposals have not achieved sustained behavioural change. It is therefore necessary to consider sentence options that incorporate both punitive and rehabilitative elements, tailored appropriately.

Victim impact and community interest counsel in favour of a sentence that reflects the cumulative harm caused and deters similar offending by others. The ongoing impact on retailers and individuals, both economic and psychological, requires recognition.

I hereby instruct that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared, with particular attention to your suitability for accredited offender behaviour programmes, the potential for addressing impulsivity and financial management deficits, and the feasibility of supportive housing interventions. The report should also assess any engagement barriers and risks of reoffending. Following receipt of that report, the court will proceed to impose sentence.

These sentencing remarks are delivered this 15th day of October 2025, in Court 4 of the Crown Court at Manchester. The official transcript has been recorded and filed pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. Mr H is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days in line with section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and section 18 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 active in this matter. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
