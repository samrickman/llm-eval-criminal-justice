IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEICESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/04561  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge I. J. Wells  
Filed: 14 October 2026  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction for an offence under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically shoplifting. The charge concerns a pattern of offending which occurred intermittently between September 2024 and February 2026 across various retail premises located in the Leicester city centre and adjacent satellite shopping districts.

Procedural History  
Your initial appearance took place on 3 March 2026 at the Leicester Magistrates’ Court, where you made no indication to plead guilty. The case was committed to this Crown Court under the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 due to either the seriousness of the charge or the complexity of the proceedings. The case was accordingly listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 11 May 2026. Due to resource constraints and calendar congestion arising from recent staff shortages exacerbated by ongoing industrial action affecting court support services nationally, that hearing was vacated and relisted for 8 July 2026. Counsel for the defence then sought an adjournment to enable further psychiatric evaluation and report gathering, listing the matter for today’s hearing.

The court registers its appreciation for the patience and understanding exhibited by victims, witnesses, and all parties during the course of these adjournments, particularly given the extraordinary operational pressures bearing on the justice system at this time. It is a well-documented concern that the cumulative effect of delays—whether attributable to systemic underfunding, increased case volumes, or extraordinary events such as technological malfunctions in case management software—continues to impede timely resolution of matters, adversely affecting all involved. Indeed, the Legal Aid Agency’s ongoing difficulties with prompt authorisation of expert assistance have complicated defence preparations, a situation which the court has noted with increasing alarm on several occasions over the past year.

The matter proceeded today by way of Guilty Plea in open court, the first occasion on which you have admitted responsibility. Counsel is duly thanked for clear and thorough submissions made on your behalf, including extensive exploration of mitigation based on personal history and circumstance. The Crown, represented by Ms Eleanor Faulkner, also presented detailed arguments as to aggravating factors and the impact upon victims and the wider community. The written victim personal statements circulated by the Leicester Retailers Association have been carefully considered and shall inform sentencing.

In crafting these remarks, the court is mindful of the jurisprudential framework governing theft offences and particularly the case law surrounding repeat shoplifting conduct. In R v. Greenfield [2019] EWCA Crim 2222, the Court of Appeal underscored the need for proportionate but firm responses to repeated acquisition offences, emphasising the cumulative effect on victims, particularly staff, and wider retail ecosystems. While Greenfield pertained to offences committed over a two-year period across a regional shopping mall, the principles articulated are readily applicable here. The court notes with interest that in Greenfield, the appellate court refused to accept that a lengthy criminal record devoid of violent offending constituted sufficient mitigation to obviate immediate custodial sentence in the face of sustained offending.

Counsel for the defence invoked the more recent decision in R v. Simmonds [2023] EWCA Crim 1019, concerning a defendant with diagnosed impulse control disorder who committed a series of low-level thefts from supermarkets in the Manchester area. While recognising the mitigating effect of documented psychological impairment, the Court of Appeal nevertheless warned against ‘overmedicalising’ criminal conduct where it masks wilful disregard for lawful behaviour. The juxtaposition of these authorities provides a useful doctrinal backdrop to the present determination.

The Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, introduced in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 3, informed the progression of this matter. I note, with some encouragement, that notwithstanding initial delays attributable to defence applications relating to expert instructions and legal aid authorisation, the prosecution complied fully with disclosure obligations. Witness statements, CCTV evidence, and forensic recovery reports were provided within prescribed timelines, reflecting commendable application of Case Management principles insofar as the constraints permitted. It is regrettable, however, that the Legal Aid Agency’s process resulted in an unfortunate six-week hiatus in the procurement of the independent psychiatric report initially proposed.

The court wishes to formally thank Professor Amelia Moretti, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose lengthy and detailed clinical report was received on 3 August 2026. Her observations on Mr H’s mental health state are necessarily integral to the sentencing calculus. While the report notes the presence of mild to moderate mood disorder with intermittent periods of anxiety, it firmly concludes that no acute or enduring mental illness was diagnosed. The report also documents a history of problematic but sub-threshold substance misuse, which impacted significantly on impulsivity and decision-making processes. Professor Moretti’s balanced assessment is appreciated; though lengthy—with over 30 pages including detailed neurocognitive testing—the report remains cogent and professionally sound.

One must pause briefly to note the clinical challenges facing psychiatric evaluators in the current political climate. NHS Trust waiting lists for forensic and community psychiatry have lengthened significantly in recent years, with reports from the Royal College of Psychiatrists indicating increased caseloads and reduced specialist availability. The impact of these systemic pressures cannot be overstated in the provision of expert evidence.

The community sentencing environment is no less affected. The Leicester Probation Service, operating under the emerging principles of the National Probation Framework, suffers frequent staffing vacancies, incipient burnout, and strained resources following the abolishment of the former privatised model. Nevertheless, the pre-sentence report requested subsequent to the plea will benefit from input by seasoned officers versed in acquisitive crime interventions.

It is worth noting here that repeated offending of this nature has been the subject of strategic scrutiny under the Leicester Retail Crime Reduction Initiative, a multi-agency partnership convened in 2022 to curb burgeoning theft rates in urban shopping corridors. While laudable in its aims, the initiative faces persistent challenges in real-time intelligence sharing, limited budget allocations for enhanced security measures, and occasional friction between enforcement bodies and civil liberty advocates.

The Crown’s case demonstrates, beyond reasonable doubt, the sustained nature of your offending against vulnerable, independently owned pharmacies and convenience stores, several of which reported considerable economic loss compounded by shifts in staff morale and retention. The social costs of such criminal behaviour exceed the mere market value of the stolen property. Those working in the retail sector, often on precarious contracts and low remuneration, bear an emotional burden unwitnessed by the general public. The court heard with regret that one long-standing shop assistant had taken early retirement citing “anxiety and fear in the workplace.” The effect on such individuals is material and lasting.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

Prior to your conviction today, a previously recorded community resolution was applied following an incident in April 2024, intended as a diversionary measure to engage you in remedial and supervisory support. That intervention failed to prevent recurrence. Correspondence received from the Leicester Retail Coalition, included within the court papers, expresses mounting frustration with perceived recidivism and calls for more robust enforcement. While the Coalition remains supportive of rehabilitative approaches, the prevailing sentiment advocates for deterrent action proportionate to repeated breaches of the law.

The court recognises the submission of mitigating material, including a letter from Mr H’s sister, Ms Beatrice H., who describes longstanding family conflict, interrupted schooling from age 14, and episodes of unstable housing culminating in short-term placements facilitated by the Leicester Homelessness Prevention Service. This latter body has intervened on multiple occasions over the past three years, offering emergency accommodation and connection to social support, albeit with inconsistent engagement from Mr H.

This is a clear illustration of the complexities inherent in cases where acquisitive offending intersects with social vulnerability. It illustrates the interaction between structural scarcity and individual responsibility. The court acknowledges the commendable efforts of voluntary sector workers who, despite underfunding and restrictive capacity, continue to offer guidance and advocacy to those at risk.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Turning now to relevant jurisprudence, the court recalls the decision in R v. Boulton [2018] EWCA Crim 207, which addressed the parameters for custodial threshold in low-value but repeated thefts. Despite the absence of violence or threats, the Court of Appeal emphasised the need for deterrence where the offending demonstrates ‘persistence and wilful continuation despite warnings.’ The present facts bear significant congruence with Boulton, particularly in light of your previous convictions and post-diversion conduct.

Similarly, R v. Hadley [2022] EWCA Crim 778, which concerned serial shop theft from chain stores using coordinated distraction tactics, reiterated the aggravating nature of planned dishonesty and sustained targeting of retail employees. Hadley further highlighted the need to protect vulnerable outlets and maintain public confidence in lawful commerce.

I also take the opportunity to reference the well-established sentencing framework outlined by the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guideline (2019), which, while calibrated primarily on value and harm, explicitly calls for assessment of culpability factors including sophistication, persistence, prior warnings, and public interest in deterrence. Given the cross-sectional nature of your offending, these criteria are plainly engaged.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

The court is mindful of the traditional challenge in encouraging early guilty plea in repeat offenders. The principle of discounting sentences to reflect the saving of public and private resources is of foundational importance in criminal administration. R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029 struck a cautionary note about defendants who postpone pleas until evidential certainty emerges, thus diminishing the usefulness of the mitigation principle. Your plea being tendered only after trial evidential preparation, and following comprehensive disclosure, engages these concerns.

Your personal circumstances were exhaustively examined in the pre-sentence report compiled by Ms Hilary Grayson, Senior Probation Officer, dated 10 September 2026. Ms Grayson remarks upon your inconsistent engagement with community resources, noting “episodic compliance interspersed with withdrawal.” She further observes your employment history is characterised by transient labour in the hospitality sector, with repeated lost opportunities due to instability in accommodation and substance misuse. Her concluding opinion cautiously recommends a community order with supervision, contingent upon demonstrated commitment to restorative services.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

The court heard submissions relating to your character references, including one from the Leicester Soup Kitchen, describing attendance over the past six months and involvement in peer mentoring programmes. While such contributions reflect positively on your intentions, the court is bound to weigh these alongside the seriousness of the offence and the imperative of protection to retail personnel.

It is worthy of note that the court received a detailed report from the Leicester Substance Dependency Service, which assessed your engagement with their outpatient addiction programme. The report, dated 18 July 2026, notes significant challenges in maintaining regular attendance and fluctuating motivation. This service remains willing to accept your cooperation post-sentencing but highlights that sustained treatment must be court-supported to ensure efficacy.

The wider societal context to which this case belongs must not be overlooked. National statistics indicate a troubling rise in acquisitive crime linked in part to economic precarity, housing instability, and mental health burdens exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic’s lingering effects. The strain on police forces is compounded by increasing expectations to attend to “non-serious” offences, often impeding the investigation of violent crime. This dynamic underlies the judiciary’s responsibility to strike a balance between proportionality and deterrence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

While on bail awaiting trial, you were subject to stringent conditions restricting contact with certain retail premises and prohibiting possession of certain payment devices and bags. These conditions were informed by intelligence reports provided by the Leicester Safer Neighbourhood Police Team and coordinated pursuant to the local Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA). The operational complexity of such arrangements often exceeds the public’s awareness, involving monitoring, risk assessment, and tailored interventions designed to pre-empt reoffending.

The court records its gratitude to the officers on the ground who operate within these frameworks, frequently stretched by competing demands and chronic understaffing. The demands of consistent public protection in the context of acquisitive crime are by no means minor, even where violence is absent.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

A separate but tangentially related issue emerged during the course of proceedings. The defendant’s co-habitant was subject to investigation for possession of controlled substances in late 2025. To be clear, no evidence ties Mr H to this matter. While such adjacent difficulties may inform family and social background, they remain extraneous to the current case.

It is an unfortunate truth that such vicarious complications complicate the administration of justice and often serve to distract from the conduct at hand.

The court also notes, without suggesting causal link, a contemporaneous investigation of a co-defendant in a wholly unrelated criminal matter involving assault occasioning actual bodily harm in Leicester’s West End, which concluded in a separate trial where that individual was convicted. The present proceedings are unconnected to that offence save for superficial association.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

In conclusion, Mr H, the offences before this court represent a significant breach of public trust. The persistence of your actions, refusal or inability to adhere to previous rehabilitative efforts, and the resultant impact on retail staff and businesses require a firm response. Whilst the court is not unmindful of your personal hardships and the systemic failings that bear upon individuals in your position, these cannot excuse continued disregard for the law and for the community’s right to personal and commercial safety.

Accordingly, I will adjourn sentence to allow the probation service to prepare a full pre-sentence report with recommended disposal options, including consideration of possible community rehabilitation orders incorporating cognitive behavioural therapy, unpaid work requirements directed at community benefit, and structured financial management assistance. The report should also address your engagement potential with addiction services. Prison sentence should not be ruled out, should the report indicate a lack of realistic prospect for rehabilitation in the community or an ongoing risk of reoffending.

These sentencing remarks are handed down this 14th day of October 2026 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Leicester. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. Mr H is hereby informed of his right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 (section 49) shall apply unless a further application is made.

These are the orders of the court.
