IN THE CROWN COURT AT HULL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/15439  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. E. CHAMBERS  
Filed: 15 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court on indictment following your conviction for offences of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending occurred over an extended timeframe, from late 2023 through the early part of this year, and took place within the Kingston upon Hull area, involving multiple stores, part of both national chains and independent operators.

Procedural History  
Your arrest came after a prolonged inquiry initiated by the Hull Business Crime Reduction Unit and supplemented by local policing teams. The investigation, which was admittedly complex and multilayered, involved liaison with store security staff, examination of digital recording devices, and scrutiny of witness statements provided across several sites. This inquiry unfolded alongside the operation of the Better Case Management (BCM) protocols designed to enhance the efficiency with which such cases are handled, particularly those involving an accumulation of relatively low-value incidents which, taken individually, might otherwise risk being overlooked.

It is an unfortunate reality that cases such as this one frequently place administrative pressure on the judiciary and prosecuting authorities alike. The piling together of multiple minor incidents, repetitive procedural scheduling, and the requirement for multiple victim statements amplify workload considerably. To this end, this court notes with frustration the ongoing staffing shortages in probation services which exacerbate the challenge of timely report preparation. In addition, this case was subject to an adjournment caused by a temporary unavailability of expert psychiatric services, a difficulty compounded by protracted NHS waiting lists impacting mental health assessments generally.

In anticipation of today’s sentencing hearing, I have reviewed correspondence from the probation officer overseeing your case, highlighting an increased workload stemming from cumulative obligations under Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARAC) and the growing demands of the MAPPA framework, which regularly consumes probation resources. This is a cautionary backdrop against which your case proceeds.

During proceedings, your counsel, Mr Alan Greensdale, whose consistent advocacy merits recognition for its thoroughness and measured approach, has made detailed submissions concerning your background and mitigating factors. I acknowledge that the Legal Aid Agency, while ultimately authorising representation for your defence, delayed approval on application for expert reports, a regrettable but increasingly familiar systemic issue that inevitably prolongs case progression.

To provide some statutory context, the Theft Act 1968 remains the bedrock legislation governing offences of dishonest appropriation. I take note of the Sentencing Council’s overarching guidelines on theft offences, which emphasise patterns of offending, aggravating factors such as targeting vulnerable premises or repeat offending, and the impact on victims and communities. The judiciary is reminded, however, that sentencing must be individualised and weighted according to all relevant features of the conduct in question.

The jurisprudence at appellate level offers further granularity in guiding sentencing discretion. R v. Cambridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1243 emphasised that although repeated low-value thefts might be dismissed in isolation, the aggregate harm—including impact on staff morale and small business viability—can warrant significant custodial sentences. Likewise, R v. Faulkner [2023] EWCA Crim 876 added that persistent disregard for prior warnings or diversion opportunities amplifies culpability.

Various analogous decisions relating to offences across diverse contexts are apt illustrations of sentencing principles, though they should not be taken as direct precedential levers in your case. For example, R v. Chandler [2019] EWCA Crim 1054 — concerning fly-tipping on green belt land — reiterated the principle that persistent regulatory breaches, despite the ostensibly technical or victimless nature of the offences, may rightly attract custodial penalties to uphold public confidence and the rule of law. Similarly, R v. Westfield [2021] EWCA Crim 1578 in which an aggravated affray involving pool cues was heard, though unrelated to theft, serves to highlight the courts’ general disapproval of sustained antisocial conduct, irrespective of the specific domain.

Attention must necessarily return to those specifics, for that is the relevant inquiry at hand. Before detailing the precise circumstances of the offending, I pause to note that co-defendant material introduced during the investigation revealed the presence of offences unrelated to your conduct, including an aggravated assault on a police officer involving a metal chair. While such evidence was not pertinent to your trial and conviction, it formed part of the background context within which the multi-agency investigation operated.

The facts of this case must be considered in light of the evidence presented. You stand convicted on a single representative count, but one which captures a broader and more protracted pattern of theft and exploitation of retail staff and proprietors. The prosecution relied upon contemporaneous CCTV footage, staff accounts, forensic analysis of recovered merchandise, and the identifying link of clothing and footwear visible during several incidents.

It is apparent that your conduct entailed deliberate planning and employed a combination of distraction techniques and concealment methods. Various reports from affected shop staff describe heightened stress levels, changes in shift patterns, and, in some cases, requests to employers for transfer or enhanced protective measures. While there was no direct intimidation or physical confrontation, the emotional impact on personnel is nonetheless tangible.

I must observe that no investigations currently suggest your involvement in offences such as possession of bladed articles on school premises or drug dealing in proximity to youth hostels, despite some co-defendants in related matters facing such charges. Nor has any evidence linked you to incidents of criminal damage to public property, including graffiti on transport infrastructure or attacks upon religious institutions. These unrelated issues nevertheless emerged in communications between law enforcement agencies during multi-agency tasking meetings and exemplify the broader criminal ecology from which your case was ultimately distinguished.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Let it also be recorded that one of the expert reports prepared for sentencing purposes was originally delayed due to your counsel’s application for adjournment to obtain family character references and letters of support from voluntary sector organisations. These include heartfelt communications from staff at the Hull Homeless Support Network and the East Yorkshire Community Foodbank, which were subsequently lodged with the court and considered alongside formal assessments.

The court appreciates the work of those volunteers and professionals who provide such assistance to vulnerable individuals. Their commitment often absorbs substantial operational pressure, especially as local service capacity continues to be tested by rising demand. Their reliance on charitable donations and fluctuating volunteer staff cannot be understated. It is a significant societal challenge that, regrettably, impacts the rehabilitation prospects of many who come before the court.

It is also necessary to acknowledge ongoing pressures on police resources, which must be apportioned between serious and less-serious crime. The disproportionate demand placed by frequent, repeated retail theft can detract attention from investigations into violent offences or gang-related activity. This reality is no reflection on the diligence of frontline officers, but an unavoidable consequence of constrained budgets and rising caseloads.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

It is germane to mention here the recent Court of Appeal decision in R v. Drax [2025] EWCA Crim 314, which, while concerned with a charge of benefit fraud committed by a defendant unrelated to the present proceedings, reiterates the courts’ overarching duty to consider previous offending, continuation or escalation of conduct, and prospect of reform when determining appropriate sentence.

Records before the court reveal that you have previous convictions related to theft offences stretching back over a decade, including two separate community orders and a conditional discharge imposed in 2021 following a similar pattern of shoplifting in the East Riding area. That your offending has persisted despite these interventions evidences a concerning record of recidivism.

Expert Evidence and Pre-Sentence Report Observations  
The psychiatric report prepared by Dr Amanda Forster, consultant forensic psychologist, assesses you as not suffering from any major mental disorder. However, she notes traits suggestive of impulsivity and low frustration tolerance. She also comments on your expressed feelings of social marginalisation and financial instability. Dr Forster recommended consideration of a structured cognitive-behavioural treatment programme tailored to acquisitive offending, though she expressed reservations about your current engagement with supportive services.

The pre-sentence report dated 10 September 2025 reflects similar themes. The author notes your lack of stable employment and housing, intermittent contact with family members, and a history of substance misuse. It further references your refusal to engage meaningfully with debt counselling or budgeting support, despite multiple offers.

I must register concern regarding these findings. There is a widening gap between the availability of assistance—ranging from charity sector support to statutory programmes—and the willingness or capacity of some offenders to access them. This gap undermines the effectiveness of rehabilitative efforts and poses a risk to public protection.

During the hearing, the court received letters from the Hull Business Crime Alliance, a collective of local enterprises committed to reducing retail crime impact. They detailed economic losses related to your offences, as well as the psychological strain on frontline retail staff. Their submissions, while measured, were clear in asserting that repeat shoplifting is corrosive to local commerce and community safety. The court extends gratitude to this body for their informed and conscientious contributions.

General societal context cannot be ignored. We live in a time marked by increased visibility of street homelessness—where rough sleeping has become commonplace on city thoroughfares and underpasses—and a rising tide of antisocial behaviour that, if unchecked, intensifies community fears. While these issues do not excuse criminal offending, they constitute a complex matrix within which police, probation, and social services operate.

It is also noted with concern that in the course of the investigation, your landlord was subject to a noise abatement notice relating to disturbances unrelated to your behaviour. This circumstance, while tangential, illustrates the multi-layered challenges faced by social housing providers in maintaining secure and peaceful living environments.

Sentencing Principles and Discretion  
The court is guided primarily by the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences. Clear aggravating factors in this case include persistence despite prior warnings and orders, the impact on vulnerable businesses, and the calculated nature of your actions.

While your guilty plea is recognised, its timing—late in the proceedings following the near certainty of conviction—limits the extent of credit available. This approach aligns with established principles articulated in R v. Kyriazis [2023] EWCA Crim 470, where the Court confirmed that timing, not mere entry, of a plea informs the quantum of reduction.

I remind the parties of the court’s responsibility to impose sentences proportionate to the conduct while balancing the need for deterrence, public confidence, and rehabilitation. Custodial sentences in theft cases of this sort are reserved for serious or persistent offending where community-based penalties are insufficient to protect the public or reduce reoffending.

Closing Remarks  
I record that today’s sentencing hearing has been conducted in open court with the benefit of thorough preparation by counsel on both sides. I extend thanks to Ms Sarah Linton, prosecuting counsel, for her clear presentation, and to Mr Alan Greensdale, who represented you with due professionalism.

I reiterate concern over procedural delays encountered during these proceedings, particularly those attributable to the Legal Aid Agency’s slow authorisation of expert instruction. These lapses hinder the efficient administration of justice and impose avoidable burdens on all participants.

Accordingly, I order that a further pre-sentence report be commissioned. This report should encompass consideration of all viable sentencing options, including community sentences incorporating rehabilitation activity requirements and potential unpaid work, balanced with an assessment of risk to the public. Consideration should also be given to any structured programme addressing impulsivity and financial management, should you engage accordingly.

Pending receipt and consideration of that report, sentencing will be adjourned. A date will be fixed to resume these proceedings in due course.

These sentencing remarks have been delivered and recorded this 15th day of September 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Hull. The transcript has been duly certified and filed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. You are reminded of your right to appeal against sentence within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions imposed under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
