IN THE CROWN COURT AT RIVERSIDE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. R2025/14512  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. D. Ellwood  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear today for sentence before this court following your conviction for an offence of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The course of conduct upon which you stand convicted pertains to multiple incidents occurring intermittently throughout the calendar years 2023 and 2025, primarily within the central Riverside commercial districts, including several independently run pharmacies and chains.  

Procedural Background  
You were originally charged on 12 April 2025, following your arrest on 10 April by officers attached to the Riverside Metropolitan Police Retail Enforcement Unit. The investigation underpinning your apprehension followed months of intelligence-gathering prompted by a surge in reported retail thefts within key areas of the city centre and surrounding boroughs. The case was allocated to this Crown Court for trial following committal proceedings at Riverside Magistrates’ Court held on 26 May 2025.  

It is appropriate to acknowledge here the cooperation extended by various public bodies involved at the investigative and prosecutorial stages. This includes the Riverside Business Crime Partnership, whose collated incident logs and prompt reporting of suspicious activity were vital in enabling the police to prioritise their deployment. While such inter-agency collaboration is advocated and prescribed under local policy frameworks devised to address retail crime, this court recognises the ongoing strain placed upon these bodies by increasing case volume and resource scarcity. Their unheralded efforts have been instrumental to the orderly progression of the matter.  

The case’s procedural timeline was not without challenge. Initial listing delays were occasioned by the unavailability of defence counsel and occasions of industrial action within the administrative departments of the Legal Aid Agency, which affected the timely provision of funding authorisations for your legal representation. Such systemic issues, while unfortunate, should not detract from the dedication of the personnel managing your defence or the judiciary’s firm commitment to maintaining fair process within permissible constraints.  

At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 3 June 2025, you entered a plea of not guilty. This court notes that the trial was listed for 28 July but was vacated when your plea was ultimately changed to guilty on 24 July, shortly before trial commences. The timing of this plea attracts particular scrutiny given the expectations described in authorities such as R v. Smith [2020] EWCA Crim 678 and R v. Ferris [2021] EWCA Crim 1193, which govern the exercise of judicial discretion regarding credit for guilty pleas and highlight the distinction between early admissions and those conceded proximate to trial.  

The court is mindful that credit for guilty pleas is not a matter of right or routine but one grounded in genuine remorse, early acceptance of culpability, and the resultant conservation of scarce judicial and prosecutorial resources. Mr H, your plea, tendered only days ahead of trial, limits the scope of credit available, particularly as substantial disclosure and witness preparation had already been effected.  

It is useful here to frame your case within the context of both the criminal justice system’s evolving administrative protocols and the societal backdrop against which shoplifting offences now occur. The Crown Court at Riverside, established in 1987 and refurbished in 2018 with enhanced digital evidence presentation facilities, frequently observes the cyclical nature of acquisitive crimes and their relationship with socioeconomic factors affecting local communities. We acknowledge, however, that the law requires a principled and consistent response regardless of such external considerations.  

It is incumbent on the court to note that public perception of shoplifting offences has fluctuated markedly in recent years. Where once such conduct might have been dismissed as simple poverty-related misdemeanour, contemporary understanding—shaped by crime prevention policy, victim impact research, and offender profiling—recognises the broader harms caused by persistent, calculated dishonesty. This is especially so where victims include small business owners and vulnerable employees, whose livelihood and wellbeing are materially affected. This acknowledgment is not mere rhetoric but a reflection of empirical evidence gathered by academic researchers and agencies including the National Retail Crime Survey (NRCS) published in 2024.  

To that end, the Riverside District Probation Service has, over the last two years, seen a 14% increase in the caseload of offenders subject to community penalties for theft-related offences. This is occurring amidst considerable staffing shortages—a phenomenon detailed in the recent CJS Workforce Review Report (2025)—and significant challenges posed by increased caseload complexity. These pressures have tangible effects on the quality and timeliness of reports submitted to the court and, by extension, the sentencing process.  

The Legal Aid Agency continues to grapple with allocative efficiency deficits, notably in authorising expert assessments pertinent to such offences. In this case, an application for psychiatric evaluation funding was submitted on 10 June 2025 but only approved on 1 August after follow-up appeals from the defence. The delay adversely affected the scheduling of the planned psychiatric report, which was eventually completed by Dr Melvin Rhodes, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, on 18 August 2025. The court thanks Dr Rhodes for his comprehensive and timely assistance.  

Dr Rhodes’s report explores, among other things, your mental health background, psychological vulnerabilities, and risk factors relevant to your offending pattern. While finding no evidence of major mental illness or psychosis, the report identifies impulse control difficulties and concurrent mild alcohol dependency. Notably, it also highlights a deficit in your engagement with community-based social support mechanisms prior to your arrest—a factor that may be of relevance both to risk and rehabilitation prospects.  

The Probation Service produced a pre-sentence report shortly before today’s hearing; this report appraises your circumstances, including housing instability, employment history, and social relationships. It recommends consideration of interventions to improve personal resilience and pro-social decision-making, consistent with the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guidelines (2024 revision).  

Throughout the proceedings, the court has endeavoured to balance the necessity for a proportionate, individualized response with the imperative to uphold public confidence in the criminal justice system. It must, however, be emphasised that repeated offending in shoplifting does not diminish the impact felt by victims and retailers, nor the cumulative burden on law enforcement and support services.  

Discussion of Relevant Case Law and Sentencing Principles  
In addressing the principles relevant to your sentence, the court is mindful of the statutory framework established under the Theft Act 1968 and the guidance promulgated by the Sentencing Council. The principal aim is the prompt and effective disposal of offences while considering personal mitigation, public protection, and deterrence.  

While your offending is not categorised under the most serious tier, it nonetheless falls within a class of conduct with significant disruptive potential domestically and economically. The aggravated circumstances of targeting independent pharmacies have been addressed in recent appellate decisions such as R v. Cartwright [2023] EWCA Crim 804, which emphasised the heightened impact on community trust and the additional psychological toll on frontline staff. While those circumstances differ somewhat from your conduct, they speak to the prevailing judicial attitude toward such offences.  

I further note, albeit without immediate application, R v. Bainbridge [2019] EWCA Crim 316, a case concerned with aggravated burglary involving high-value hardware theft; distinct from this matter but illustrative of the Court of Appeal’s approach to offences escalating beyond mere theft to include breach of domestic sanctity and serious property damage. Such decisions underscore the importance of correctly calibrating sentence severity to both the offence’s nature and broader societal impact.  

Of tangential interest is the case of R v. Fenton [2021] EWCA Crim 1127, which involved an assault occasioning actual bodily harm during a shoplifting incident. The defendant in that case invoked intoxication as a mitigating factor, but the Court of Appeal confirmed that violence accompanying theft significantly escalates culpability and sentence length. Although no violence is alleged here, the case contextually illustrates the threshold at which theft crossings into violent offending trigger markedly different judicial responses.  

It is also worth noting ongoing developments in forensic evidence gathering and digital data use, exemplified in recent rulings such as R v. Dunlap [2024] EWCA Crim 452, where biometric surveillance and mobile device triangulation data were permitted as key evidence. While your case did not involve the latter, the investigative process was aided by CCTV cross-referencing and time-stamped transactional data—a reflection of the increasing sophistication and resource intensity devoted to such matters.  

The court acknowledges the significant investment of public funds into this inquiry, including the contributions of the Riverside Digital Forensics Unit, whose work in processing and authenticating video material was pivotal. This unit, while being a centre of technological expertise, faces increasing demand beyond capacity, according to the April 2025 Metropolitan Policing Resource Utilisation Report.  

Victim Impact and Community Perspectives  
The statements from affected retailers and their employees have been presented as part of the prosecution’s evidence. These accounts attest to the erosion of employee morale, the increased anxiety of staff working alone, and the requirement to alter operational protocols and shift patterns as a direct consequence of repeated theft incidents. One pharmacy manager reported the cost of replacing security tags and enhanced stock monitoring systems in excess of £2,000 over the period in question, adding to operational pressures already exacerbated by staffing shortages.  

The local Pharmacy Support Network provided a statement, underscoring the psychosocial impact of your repeated visits. Their submission notes the challenge of maintaining patient confidentiality and safety while navigating the consequences of financial losses and staff turnover. Such observations, while ancillary to your individual conduct, form part of the ecosystem of harm wrought by persistent retail theft.  

The court has also taken account of correspondence from the Riverside Community Trust, which indicated growing concern over the normalization of petty crime in neighbourhood commercial zones. This organization stressed the necessity for restorative approaches, including offender reparation and community engagement initiatives, which may reduce reoffending and repair damaged relationships.  

While well-intentioned, such charitable input cannot substitute for judicially mandated sanctions where offences have demonstrated calculated strategy and persistence. The reconciliation of community repair with punitive sanction remains a delicate task within the sentencing remit.

The Facts of the Offending  
Mr H, your offending was characterised as a course of conduct involving the surreptitious removal of merchandise, predominantly health and personal care products valued individually at modest sums but cumulatively significant. Your methodology involved timed entry to premises during busy periods and the use of distraction techniques.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

This consistent approach demonstrates forethought and awareness of risk, counterposed against a repeated willingness to contravene legal and social norms. It is unfortunate, despite prior formal and informal interventions, including community resolutions offered through the Riverside Restorative Justice Programme, that you persisted.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

The thefts, while lacking violence or overt threats, nonetheless had measurable repercussions on victims and employees, who described sustained feelings of unease and work-related stress. There is clear evidence of store managers adapting operating procedures—such as limiting access to certain products and restricting opening hours in the face of prevailing risk.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

The scale and repetition of your conduct illusively mirror patterns seen in more serious property crimes; indeed, the frequent return to known premises reflects a degree of confidence and familiarity that compounds culpability. It is noted also that previous convictions for shoplifting spanning the past eight years did little to deter this escalation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

The court further records that the offences in question have placed an undue strain on multiple stakeholders, including police resources diverted from other public safety priorities and the time-consuming task of preparing evidential materials for trial. This is in line with observations found in the 2024 National Crime Report regarding acquisition crime resource demands.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Your lack of engagement with outreach and social support services prior to arrest has been duly noted in expert reports. This reluctance to proactively seek or accept assistance diminishes opportunities for rehabilitation and increases the risk of recidivism.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

The Crown rightly submits that your pattern of offending, coupled with prior warnings and diversions, aggravates your culpability and militates against leniency.

Expert Reports and Risk Analysis  
As previously mentioned, Dr Rhodes’s psychiatric evaluation ruled out any major mental illness but remarked on your impulsivity and mild alcohol dependency. These findings suggest a degree of vulnerability that justifies tailored intervention but are insufficient to mitigate the seriousness of offence conduct wholly.  

The probation report provides a further comprehensive framework for assessing your rehabilitation needs, recommending a multi-faceted approach including cognitive-behavioural therapy modules and substance misuse counselling. The report emphasises the importance of addressing underlying triggers and enhancing your capacity for lawful behavioural patterns.  

It should be highlighted that Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), while prevalent in offender populations, should not be conflated with diminished responsibility absent clinical evidence of acute intoxication at the time of offences. The court notes that attempts to attribute offending solely to substance use have been consistently rejected in appellate guidance, including R v. Simmons [2022] EWCA Crim 956.  

Furthermore, the Probation Service reiterates the pervasive stress and instability arising from your current precarious housing situation and recommends liaison with local housing providers to secure more stable accommodation, acknowledging that such stability is often a precursor to effective rehabilitation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1} to {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8} have been reviewed carefully to assist in the comprehensive determination of appropriate disposition.  

The Court’s Consideration of Public Protection and Sentencing Options  
In these circumstances, an effective sentence must balance the proportionality of punishment against viable rehabilitation. The Sentencing Council's Theft Offences Guideline instructs that the harm caused, culpability, and previous convictions are the primary yardsticks by which sentence creditworthiness is measured.  

The court remains conscious of the broader societal challenges underpinning acquisitive crime, such as economic hardship, substance addiction, and social marginalisation. Nonetheless, these do not remove personal accountability or diminish the necessity of safeguarding public confidence in the rule of law.  

Community orders with tailored requirements, including unpaid work and rehabilitation activity requirements, remain a potent tool for addressing offending caused or aggravated by underlying vulnerabilities. Custodial sentences, in contrast, should not be imposed lightly, particularly where community-based dispositions might achieve the dual objectives of punishment and reform.  

The court accepts the probation officer’s observations that your engagement with previous community resolutions and offers of support has been limited, but notes that immediate custody may not afford you the requisite opportunity for constructive intervention. This mirrors findings in the well-regarded summary in R v. Clarke [2021] EWCA Crim 345, affirming that the unavailability or premature imposition of custody can reduce rehabilitative outcomes.  

That being said, any final sentence must also reflect deterrence, both individual and general, to counter the increasing trend of repeat acquisitive offending within urban retail environments.  

It is also necessary to consider the impact of a custodial sentence on your housing and family circumstances, which the probation report details with particular care. While I do not discount these mitigating factors, they cannot override the primacy of public safety and the need for the sentence to align with statutory and guideline parameters.  

In relation to ancillary matters, I note that there is no allegation or evidence of gang involvement, use of weapons, or violence. Unlike cases such as R v. Hobbs [2020] EWCA Crim 221, where multiple co-defendants engaged in coordinated theft with aggravating features, your conduct was individual and did not extend to such escalations. The presence of co-defendants in other investigations related to the local area—none of whom were connected to you—is recorded without bearing on your personal culpability.  

The court further observes that unrelated offences heard recently in this jurisdiction, such as R v. Delaney [2025] RVR 54, involving aggressive fly-tipping in green belt land, or R v. Thorne [2024] EWCA Crim 312 involving possession of a bladed article in a school car park, though demonstrating concern about law and order, do not influence the sentencing outcome here.  

There is also no suggestion in this case of any involvement with drugs importation, serious violence, or fraud offences which might otherwise offer comparative insights or aggravate the seriousness.  

Conclusion and Directions  
Mr H, this court will adjourn sentencing to allow for the preparation of a final, updated pre-sentence report which incorporates assessments of your amenability to structured rehabilitation programmes and an integrated risk management plan. This adjournment is necessary given the complexity of the circumstances and the need to consider all viable disposals carefully.  

Until such a report is received, it would be premature to sanction any definitive outcome. The probation service is directed to liaise with addiction services and housing authorities to assemble a holistic picture and propose an intervention framework which promotes both rehabilitation and public protection.  

Today’s proceedings have been heard openly, with the attendance of Ms Felicity Brooks on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service and Mr Marcus Jensen representing your interests under a current Legal Aid certificate. The efforts of both parties in advancing matters notwithstanding procedural and administrative challenges have been acknowledged with gratitude.  

The court also places on the record its appreciation for the Clerk of Court and Court Support Officers, whose diligence ensures the smooth operation of these hearings, as well as for the interpreters and witness assistants present on earlier days of this case. The administrative machinery of justice functions only through dedicated collaboration at multiple levels.  

Your sentencing date is now fixed for 20 November 2025 in Court 5 at Riverside Crown Court. You are reminded of the importance of engaging fully with the probation service and any ancillary support recommended as part of the present process.  

I conclude by hereby recording that these are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge P. D. Ellwood, issued on this 17th day of September 2025. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded under the provisions of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are informed of your legal right to appeal the sentence imposed, should you choose to do so, within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. This court further notes that no reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in respect of these proceedings. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
