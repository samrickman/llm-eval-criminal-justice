IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEICESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. L2025/14309  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge I. M. BARNES  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence in relation to a charge of theft, specifically shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offence, or rather the course of conduct for which this single indictment stands representative, spans several months and involves multiple incidents occurring within the Leicester city centre and surrounding retail districts.

Procedural History  
Your initial appearance was on 6 May 2025, when charges relating to theft from retail premises were presented before the Leicester Magistrates’ Court. Following committal proceedings on 15 June 2025, this matter was transferred to the Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) procedures established to promote efficient case progression. Listings for plea and trial preparation hearings were made with some delay due to competing court priorities and intermittent periods of strike action affecting court staff nationally, factors which, though external to your case, have inevitably impacted the timeliness of proceedings.

The BCM process, introduced following Criminal Procedure Rule Part 3 amendments enacted in 2015, aims to curtail unnecessary adjournments, encourage early admissions, and facilitate disclosure protocols. In this case, practitioners on both sides have been generally compliant, but I regret to observe that there were some unavoidable delays associated with securing Legal Aid authorisation for expert instruction, notably in respect of a psychological assessment sought by your defence team. Applications and communications relating thereto spanned over six weeks, reflecting a systemic pattern of procedural inertia within the Legal Aid Agency that continues to give cause for concern among criminal justice stakeholders. The cumulative effect of such bureaucratic encumbrances is not merely inconvenience, but can undermine confidence in fairness and efficiency.

The court also records that interim bail conditions were imposed upon your release, encompassing curfew restrictions and mandatory reporting requirements monitored through electronic tagging. Skyrocketing costs and scarce availability of electronic monitoring devices have recently necessitated more frequent reliance on remote reporting, a development which has proven challenging for supervising officers as well as defendants.

I note with solemn recognition that the court registry and usher staff have adapted admirably following recent refurbishment works to the West Leicester Crown Court estate, which despite causing temporary disruption, have resulted in more accessible and secure court facilities. The new integrated audio-visual systems facilitated contemporary methods of evidence presentation, aiding in the demonstration of prosecutorial material, particularly CCTV footage.

On 12 July 2025, the court convened a plea and trial preparation hearing at which you entered a not guilty plea. Further procedural steps followed, including the exchange of witness statements, and disclosure of digital evidence recovered from several local retail establishments. Some additional interrogatories were served on behalf of the defence regarding the integrity of time stamps on security recordings, reflecting the increasing prevalence of technical contestation in theft cases amidst apparently uncontroversial factual scenarios. Notwithstanding, there was no earnest dispute regarding your presence at the places and times recorded.

The plea shifted to guilty on 2 September 2025, remarkably close to the originally scheduled trial window set for later that month. It is a regrettable, but all too frequent pattern that defendants maintain denials until confronted with overwhelming evidence, thus diminishing the discount for early admissions recognised under the Sentencing Council guidelines. The court is conscious that this behaviour imposes additional burdens, not only on victims and witnesses now compelled to prepare for trial unnecessarily, but also on already stretched public resources.

This case brings into sharp focus the challenges local policing and commerce face with regard to shoplifting and associated acquisitive offences. Anecdotal reports from retail staff, contained within victim impact statements, describe declining morale, increased anxiety about potential confrontation, and in some instances, the need for additional security measures such as electronic tagging of goods and employee training in loss prevention.

The operation of multi-agency partnership groups designed to tackle retail theft deserves mention. Leicester’s Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP) has been active in coordinating intelligence sharing among police, retailers, and local authority enforcement teams. By collating patterns of offending, the BCRP aims to identify prolific or persistent offenders and act proactively. However, as is common in many areas, limited staff resources and high caseloads constrain the effectiveness of such initiatives, rendering much reliance on the vigilance of individual shopkeepers and staff.

It is also appropriate to record that staff at the Leicester Retail Relief Network—a charitable organisation providing support to small businesses affected by crime and antisocial behaviour—provided written representations outlining their efforts to assist those businesses impacted by repeated thefts and vandalism, including engaging in community workshops on resilience and liaising with local councils for improved street lighting and CCTV coverage.

An understanding of the broader context in which offences such as those before the court occur may assist in appreciating the complex intersection between social deprivation, vulnerability, and acquisitive behaviour. It is, regrettably, a fact that repeated petty theft often collocates with issues including unstable housing, substance misuse, and mental health challenges, all of which strain public services to breaking point.

Considerable numbers of individuals presenting with shoplifting offences are found to suffer from underlying conditions—perhaps undiagnosed or untreated—that influence cognition, impulse control, or risk perception. Dr Rupert Eastwood, consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed to assess offences of similar nature in the Midlands region, has noted a consistent pattern of such associations in his professional experience spanning over two decades. Nevertheless, mental health difficulties are a complex and nuanced factor to weigh in sentencing, and must be approached with rigorous care.

In R v. Gower [2019] EWCA Crim 872, the Court reiterated that the presence of mental health conditions does not necessarily mitigate culpability where the offender consciously engages in wrongdoing. That case involved a defendant with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder who committed arson, causing significant property damage—a factually and morally distinct scenario, but nonetheless instructive in its application of proportionality and public protection.

One must also consider the impact of repeated low-level offending on victims who are not simply economic actors but members of communities. The psychological toll upon retail staff is seldom captured fully in dry statistics or procedural documents.

Across the country, retail and hospitality workers report increased hostility and a sense of helplessness against repeat offending. The practical effects manifest in increased workloads, rota changes to reduce lone working, and in some cases, threats leading to the voluntary closure of vulnerable businesses. Such consequences often ripple outward to affect the vitality of local high streets and public confidence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Histories of addressing shoplifting in case law are instructive for their articulation of sentencing principles. R v. Bromley [2018] EWCA Crim 1416 exemplifies how immediate custody may be justified for persistent offenders who demonstrate a pattern of escalation and disregard for community impact, even where individual thefts are of low value.

Conversely, R v. Cassidy [2020] EWCA Crim 2054 addressed an offender with a significant history of shoplifting linked to untreated addiction, leading the Court to endorse a community order combined with mandatory treatment requirements.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Turning to issues of procedural fairness, it must be remarked that the better resourced and more coordinated prosecutions under the Business Crime Partnership have yielded notable successes, yet uneven implementation remains a challenge. The ‘intelligence-led’ approach depends heavily on thorough data analysis by crime analysts, police resource allocation, and the active engagement of retail management.

In some boroughs, disparate IT systems and inconsistently applied data protection protocols complicate information sharing, creating “intelligence silos.” Despite this, in Leicester, there has been demonstrable improvement in coordination since the establishment of quarterly joint agency meetings.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

The present offence carries aggravating features consistent with elevated culpability: the intentional targeting of premises during busy hours, repeated offending despite prior cautions, and the resultant detrimental effects on vulnerable staff.

Mitigating features, conversely, include your personal circumstances. Dr Felicity Barrow, consultant clinical psychologist, provided an assessment at the court’s direction. Her report, dated 11 September 2025, indicates no formal diagnosis of serious mental illness but notes tendencies towards impulsivity, economic hardship, and intermittent engagement with drug and alcohol support services. Dr Barrow recommends structured interventions in cognitive behavioural therapy and practical support with housing and employment.

It remains a source of considerable frustration that public funded mental health services, particularly in community settings, are persistently overstretched. NHS waiting lists for adult psychological therapies average several months, rendering timely access unlikely. This systemic shortage affects outcomes for individuals facing compounding social and health adversities. The court reiterates the need for policy focus in this sphere.

In a contrasting matter, R v. Mullins [2023] EWCA Crim 509 involved an offender convicted of residential burglary coupled with violence. Though not directly analogous, the sentencing approach articulated therein underscores the balancing act between containment and rehabilitation.

Similarly, recent judgments in R v. Shelton [2024] EWCA Crim 1082 emphasise the importance of tailoring disposals to individual circumstances whilst ensuring deterrence and public protection.

It is important also to address the role of victim personal statements and impact evidence. Leicester Magistrates’ and Crown Courts have endeavoured to improve engagement in this area, supported by local victim liaison officers attached to the City Police Safer Neighbourhood Team. Their efforts have been evident in coordinating outreach and providing practical advice to those affected.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

Notably, your history includes both prior convictions for similar offences and several community orders, the breach of which partly precipitated this prosecution. Despite offers from probation officers of rehabilitation support and referral to social services, no meaningful engagement took place following release from your most recent conditional discharge.

That said, I acknowledge your candid letter to the court tendered via your solicitors, which though humble and carefully composed, expresses a desire to break free from offending and improve your circumstances. It is, however, a truism that desire must be accompanied by effort and compliance.

The court also notes correspondence from the Leicester Homelessness Prevention Team, confirming the precariousness of your current accommodation arrangements. Housing instability contributes to vulnerability and may exacerbate risk factors relating to exploitation and substance misuse. While sympathetic to these realities, the court must balance compassion with the demand for accountability.

Solicitors for the defence made submissions with reference to the Sentencing Council's Definitive Guideline for Theft Offences (2020 revision), highlighting opportunities for community-based sentences supplemented with supervision and tailored interventions.

After careful consideration, the Crown submitted that a custodial term is warranted, principally on grounds of general deterrence and protection of the public.

The lengthy report supplied by the probation service at the pre-sentence stage is detailed and professionally prepared. It acknowledges persistent acquisitive offending, risks of further reoffending absent intervention, and recommends consideration of a custodial sentence with a requirement for participation in accredited offending behaviour programmes, coupled with resettlement support on release.

In addition, the Probation Service highlights systemic staffing shortages, which at times limit the frequency and intensity of supervision, an issue not peculiar to Leicester but reflective of national trends.

In matters unrelated to the present case, it must be noted that recently, in adjacent regions, courts have grappled with multi-defendant conspiracies involving high-value drugs importation and sophisticated fraud offences. One might observe that the police resources allocated to shoplifting investigations, though significant in aggregate cost, pale beside those committed to these complex crimes requiring multi-year investigations.

Similarly, an ongoing case within the county concerns a co-defendant unrelated to you, charged with assaulting police officers during arrest, a matter that bears no relevance to your own culpability but often generates public interest disproportionate to its frequency.

It is also worth remarking that local community policing teams have been contending with a rise in antisocial behaviour linked to increased street homelessness, which, while tangential to acquisitive crime, influence public perceptions of safety and lawfulness. Efforts to mitigate this phenomenon include multi-agency responses integrating health, housing, and law enforcement partners.

Regrettably, a recent incident involving severe damage to a church noticeboard in the town centre, attributed to unidentified youths, highlights the challenges law enforcement faces in distinguishing between varied forms of disorderly conduct and criminality.

Similarly, concerns have been raised regarding graffiti on public transport infrastructure, a matter currently being addressed via community liaison panels.

I return now to the immediate case before the court. Your offending, although non-violent, is part of a sustained pattern that cannot be ignored. The cumulative impact on victims, businesses, and public confidence demands a sentencing response that is both firm and proportionate. The persistence of theft despite prior warnings and interventions weighs heavily against a wholly community-based disposition.

That said, your age, lack of involvement in organised crime, and the absence of violent conduct point towards a custodial sentence at the lower end of the sentencing range, subject to mitigation and the outcome of this court’s consideration of the probation report.

You were arrested following a police operation utilising body-worn cameras, a method which has become standard in local policing but nonetheless shows variation in implementation and equipment quality between forces.

The court notes the recent upgrade to digital evidence management systems at the Leicester police headquarters, which has streamlined disclosure but introduced a learning curve for some officers accustomed to legacy processes.

It is also relevant that your legal representatives have conducted themselves with professionalism and diligence, despite the difficulties posed by delayed Legal Aid approvals and limited access to expert witnesses.

Today’s hearing has been conducted in open court. I record my thanks to Ms Eleanor Fettes QC, counsel instructed on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr David Chilton, junior counsel for the defence.

I thank the court clerk and usher for their assistance in facilitating the smooth running of this hearing.

I am mindful that this judgement arrives at a time of considerable strain on the criminal justice system generally: crowded court lists, the impact of pandemic-related backlogs, and the ever-present challenge of securing timely psychiatric and psychological assessments.

It would be remiss not to mention the wider public policy debates currently underway concerning diversion schemes, mental health liaison services, and the role of restorative justice in low-level acquisitive crime.

Against this complex tapestry, the court must discharge its duty to apply the law fairly and consistently. The principles of sentencing as set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and reinforced by appellate authorities guide this court to impose a sanction that reflects the seriousness of your offending, protects the public, and offers you an opportunity to rehabilitate.

Accordingly, this court directs that a pre-sentence report be obtained without delay, containing an up-to-date risk assessment, analysis of your suitability for community alternatives, and recommendations as to appropriate custodial or non-custodial outcomes.

Until such time as that report is received and considered, no sentence will be formally pronounced.

These are the sentencing remarks of Her Honour Judge I. M. Barnes, delivered in Court 5 at Leicester Crown Court this 18th day of September 2025. A full transcript has been prepared and filed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020. The defendant will be advised of their right to appeal against any subsequent sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no interim reporting restrictions engaged pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved pending further directions.  

These are the orders of the court.
