IN THE CROWN COURT AT KENSINGTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. K2025/14579  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. S. MERRICK  
Filed: 16 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced following your conviction for theft, specifically shoplifting, committed on multiple occasions during the period from November 2023 through to May 2025. Your offending primarily targeted retail premises within the boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, with some incidents in the neighbouring district of Westminster. The charge arises under Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, and the case is being heard within the Crown Court jurisdiction due to the course-of-conduct nature of the offences, and the range of aggravating and mitigating factors that require detailed consideration beyond the scope of the Magistrates' Courts.

Procedural Background  
Your first contact with the criminal justice system relating to the conduct before this court occurred when you were arrested on 8 June 2025, following a protracted investigation led by officers attached to the Kensington Business Crime Reduction Unit. This investigation was notable for its complexity, involving multi-agency collaboration through the Kensington Partnership Against Retail Crime (KPARC), which integrates local policing teams, security personnel from multiple retail chains, and representatives from the borough’s Safer Neighbourhoods Team. The investigation was initiated after a discernible spike in thefts reported at multiple shop locations, all exhibiting similar modus operandi characteristics. The collation and analysis of CCTV data, together with liaison with retail brand loss prevention managers, were pivotal in identifying you as the principal suspect.

It is instructive to observe, without apology, that shoplifting offences, frequently disparaged as minor or victimless crime within popular discourse, exert a pervasive and deleterious impact on the local economy and community well-being. The loss of stock and increased security costs have repercussions for staffing, pricing, and the sustainability of local businesses. The psychological effect on employees—who are often frontline retail workers doing their best in demanding conditions—cannot be underestimated. While the court’s function does not extend to advocacy or economic diagnosis, it must underline that persistent shoplifting threatens both commercial viability and public confidence in the safety of retail environments.

Your case was allocated under the Better Case Management (BCM) pilot initiative introduced in this jurisdiction to enhance case preparation efficiency and reduce undue delay. Following your initial hearing on 12 June 2025, which was conducted at Kensington Magistrates’ Court, the matter was committed to this court for trial by indictment given the aggregation of incidents and the complexity of evidence. There were two plea and case management hearings—a first on 15 July 2025, and a subsequent hearing on 29 August 2025—each of which served to identify issues for trial, organise disclosure, and consider expert evidence. The prosecution was represented by Ms Harriet Jones, who presented her case with commendable clarity and diligence; the defence was represented by Mr Lewis Grant, instructed under a Legal Aid certificate, whose submissions were thorough notwithstanding challenges encountered in securing timely funding for necessary psychological assessments.

The court must express concern at the continuing difficulties presented by the administration of Legal Aid in this jurisdiction. Delays experienced in authorising funding for forensic psychiatric evaluation—requested on 5 July 2025—reflect systemic issues within the agency which, despite ongoing reforms, remain unresolved. The resulting adjournments caused avoidable postponement, placing strain on all parties and exacerbating the pressures on tightly managed court listings. Such delays jeopardise not only case progression but also the effective provision of justice, particularly for defendants with complex needs. It is hoped that the trends towards more responsive and efficient authorisations, as envisaged in recent policy reforms, will materialise with some urgency.

Legal Context and Precedent  
The offence of theft is well established, both substantively and procedurally, as codified in the Theft Act 1968 and interpreted through decades of case law. The theft of goods from retail environments, while often low in individual monetary value, carries particular significance where repeated or planned conduct demonstrates persistence or opportunism. Sentencing practice recognises that the cumulative harm from serial offending undermines market integrity and community standards.

The courts have grappled with the balance between punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation in theft cases. The Sentencing Council Guideline for Theft Offences (2022) provides a framework by which sentences should be calibrated according to the culpability of the offender, harm caused to victims, the offender’s previous history, and relevant mitigating factors. Particular aggravating features include the targeting of vulnerable persons—such as elderly or disabled retail staff—and the degree of premeditation or systematic planning. Mitigation touches on factors such as early guilty plea, lack of prior convictions, evidence of remorse, and engagement with support services.

Notable case authority offers further guidance. The principles articulated in R v. Dunning [2019] EWCA Crim 552 affirm that repeated low-value theft with evident planning attracts custodial sentences where community measures have been ineffective. Conversely, R v. Carver [2021] EWCA Crim 1014 underscored the potential for deferred sentence or suspended custodial orders in situations where genuine effort at rehabilitation could be anticipated. Equally, cases such as R v. Fletcher [2020] EWCA Crim 2117 highlight the importance of accurate risk assessment in tailoring sentences to individual circumstances. The proposition that a guilty plea at an early stage is deserving of more substantial credit remains a consistent theme throughout recent appellate decisions.

Of course, these precedents must be applied judiciously and informed by up-to-date risk and psychological evaluations.

It bears noting that the present proceedings unfolded alongside several other unrelated Crown Court matters, including a high-profile trial involving charges of aggravated burglary and possession of offensive weapons in the adjacent Westminster Court. While entirely distinct in nature and unconnected to your case, this wider context reminds us of the range and complexity of criminal matters that flow through this tier of the judiciary. The allocation of resources within the courts reflects attempt to balance the gravity of different offences—which includes provision for the necessary time adults facing mental health issues may require. Justice is, by definition, multifaceted.

The police investigation was underscored by the application of Section 18 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to obtain footage from shops’ security systems and to conduct interviews. The reliability of this evidence was not meaningfully challenged at trial, as the defence opted to contest other matters, including the claim of intent.

Notably, the current case also coincided with an operational review of the Kensington Safer Neighbourhood Policing Unit, which sought to address increasing reports of antisocial behaviour and retail crime. This review highlighted the challenge of managing finite personnel amid rising community expectations — a situation familiar to many policing bodies nationwide. The diversion of investigative resources to low-level acquisitive crime, such as in this matter, has ramifications beyond the immediate case, as it impacts capacity to respond to more serious offences. The tension between individual case management and broader operational efficiencies remains a recurrent theme in public safety discourse.

Psychiatric and Probation Assessments  
An independent clinical report was commissioned from Dr Fiona Wieland, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, which was filed with the court on 2 September 2025. Dr Wieland’s analysis was thorough and incisive, drawing upon interviews conducted over three sessions, psychometric testing, and collateral information from social service records. Her conclusions were that while you do not meet the diagnostic criteria for severe mental illness, there is evidence of a moderate depressive disorder alongside features consistent with borderline personality traits. The report notes a history of childhood adversity but emphasises your functional capacity to engage with therapeutic interventions. Dr Wieland specifically recommended consideration be given to cognitive-behavioural therapy inclusive of impulse control modules, coupled with community mental health support to reduce risk of reoffending.

The probation officer assigned to the case, Ms Elaine Morgan, submitted a comprehensive pre-sentence probation report dated 7 September 2025. The report outlines a history of transient tenancy arrangements, culminating in unstable accommodation during the period of offending. It notes that while no substantial employment history exists for over two years, there is sporadic voluntary work indicative of some social capital. Ms Morgan flagged concerns regarding social isolation and inconsistent attendance at community support meetings. Her risk evaluation—a statutory requirement under the Offender Assessment System (OASys)—places your likelihood of reoffending at the medium level, and notes the absence of any discernible pattern of violence or aggression toward others. The proposed community intervention plan includes engagement with an accredited Thinking Skills Programme and a structured drug and alcohol support pathway, reflecting a holistic approach to rehabilitation.

I should also note, with due respect, that the preparation of the probation report was delayed due to late receipt of full disclosure material and complexity of evidential matters. Such challenges are neither unusual nor unexpected in cases of this nature but serve as a reminder of the importance of pre-emptive and coordinated exchange of information.

The Position of Victims and Support Agencies  
The court received multiple victim impact statements from retail proprietors and staff affected by your offending. These statements articulate the economic consequences, including loss of merchandise, increased insurance premiums, and expenditure on security enhancements. Equally salient are the psychological effects experienced by witnesses and frontline workers, including heightened anxiety, stress, and a reported decline in workplace morale. Several employees indicated adjustments had been made to shift patterns and store layout to mitigate risk of repeat offending, underscoring the broader disruption caused.

In addition, correspondence was submitted by Kensington Retailers’ Association, which described their efforts to liaise with local authorities in developing community safety initiatives. The association, mindful of current fiscal constraints, expressed concern about the increasing scale of shoplifting incidents and called for further investment in preventive measures, including enhanced CCTV networks and public awareness campaigns. While such correspondence does not bear specifically upon your culpability, it is germane to the understanding of wider repercussions.

The voluntary sector also contributed written representations. The Kensington Outreach Project sent a letter noting their experience with clients facing housing insecurity and substance misuse, some of whom have engaged in low-level acquisitive crime. Their position underscores the significance of preventative work and early intervention, reinforcing the court’s recognition of the social context that sometimes accompanies offending.

This court recognises that notwithstanding these letters and victim statements, the perspective of those who have been harmed by your actions extends beyond immediate financial loss. It encompasses the unrest and fear generated within retail communities, and the knock-on effect on public spaces. This phenomenon is traced in literature as part of the wider trend in urban environments where increased petty crime diminishes the social fabric.

Historical and Comparative Legal Reflections  
Reviewing the statute under which you have been convicted, it is instructive to consider the legislative history of the Theft Act 1968. Established to consolidate various theft-related offences, the Act was a landmark in reforming and simplifying property crime law. Over the decades, judicial interpretation has evolved. In particular, the application of the Act to shoplifting has triggered debate over proportionality and sentencing thresholds, leading to the introduction of the Theft Mode Penalty Scheme (TMPS) in certain magistrates’ courts allowing for more flexible disposals. Nonetheless, persistent and sophisticated offending remains a matter for Crown Court consideration.

The case of R v. Elliott [2017] EWCA Crim 342 is noteworthy. It involved similar offences where a defendant employed multiple accomplices to divert retail staff’s attention, systematically removing goods with intent to resell. Although the proceeds exceeded £15,000, the sentence was mitigated by early plea and demonstration of insight. This illustrates the court’s willingness to consider the full context of conduct, including rehabilitative prospects.

The judgment in R v. Beckwith [2020] EWCA Crim 1076 reaffirmed that custodial sentences should not be imposed lightly in respect of volume theft but acknowledged the cumulative impact on victims and the retail economy. Beckwith involved a defendant with a lengthy theft-related record and failure to engage with community sentences, which precipitated multiple extensions of custodial time. Contrastingly, R v. Thomas [2021] EWCA Crim 887 emphasised community orders where offenders embraced rehabilitation.

While none of these cases align perfectly with your circumstances, they provide a backdrop for calibrated sentencing.

Contextual Social Observations  
It merits mention that recent public discourse on criminal justice has lamented the increasing normalisation of minor acquisitive offences against the backdrop of economic upheaval, housing insecurity, and pandemic-related hardship. However, the court must emphasise that acknowledgement of such social realities carries no licence for unlawful behaviour. Similarly, analysis of the challenges facing public services—including overstretched probation caseloads, health sector waiting times, and diminishing social housing—illustrates structural pressures that, while relevant, do not negate personal accountability.

The justice system remains attentive to rehabilitative paradigms. Yet there is an enduring tension between the ideals of therapeutic jurisprudence and the demands of public protection and deterrence. The court respects the work of practitioners and voluntary bodies in this endeavour. Their efforts, however, must be matched with personal responsibility to break cycles of offending.

In this vein, the influence of “social media culture” and the prevalence of instant gratification have been advanced as contributing factors in some behavioural patterns observed among young adults. Although no direct link has been drawn to your case, the phenomenon of online dissemination of thefts and challenges to authority is a growing area of concern for police and community groups alike.

Recent Justice System Developments  
The Crown Court at Kensington was formally established in 2002 to accommodate the increasing volume of complex cases arising from the capital's west end boroughs. The courtroom where this hearing is conducted was recently refurbished to enhance accessibility and integrate digital evidence presentation systems, reflecting ongoing efforts to modernise court infrastructure. These investments underscore a commitment to effective justice delivery amidst rising caseloads and judicial scrutiny.

Unusually, on the day of today's hearing, interpreter services were requested late due to a scheduling error. While no interpreter was ultimately required, this incident draws attention to broader systemic challenges around resource allocation and administrative coordination within court settings. Recognising the work of court clerks and ushers in maintaining order and ensuring smooth operation under growing pressure is important. Their role, often unseen, is indispensable.

Consideration of Sentencing Options  
The sentencing council guidelines outline a range of disposals, from conditional discharges through community orders to immediate custodial sentences, each with conditions tailored to the offender’s circumstances, past history, and risk profile. You are, presently, 38 years of age. The report indicates a medium risk of reoffending with low risk of serious harm. You have four recorded previous convictions, all for shoplifting related offences spanning a decade. There is no indication of gang affiliation or use of violence.

Your engagement with support services has been sporadic. You acknowledge financial hardship and transient housing but have declined some offers of assistance, an issue addressed in both psychiatric and probation reports.

The court notes your guilty plea, entered at trial, following a not guilty plea at earlier hearings. While the plea is accepted as sincere, it was not offered at the earliest opportunity and must be accorded appropriate but limited credit.

The court is cognizant of the strain on public resources, including police time disproportionately engaged in low-level acquisitive crime investigations—a pattern which drains capacity from violent crime and safeguarding functions. Moreover, the impact on victims extends beyond material loss to the intangible erosion of community confidence and safety.

In light of these considerations, the court is minded to explore community-based interventions where feasible, yet also must reserve the possibility of custodial sanction given the persistence of offending and repeated failure to desist following previous warnings and disposals.

Final Procedural Remarks  
In conclusion, the court directs that sentencing be deferred pending the receipt of an updated pre-sentence report incorporating recent mental health input and any further representations from the defence. The probation service is asked to consider fully the feasibility of a comprehensive community order incorporating rehabilitation activity, mental health support, unpaid work, and curfew requirements, alongside conditions designed to disrupt the offending pattern.

The matter is adjourned for sentence to 4 November 2025 at 10am. The hearing has taken place in open court, with counsel for both parties present throughout. I express thanks to Ms Harriet Jones and Mr Lewis Grant for their submissions, which have been professionally delivered and considered respectfully.

You are hereby reminded of your right to appeal the sentence within 28 days under the provisions of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 applicable in this case. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
