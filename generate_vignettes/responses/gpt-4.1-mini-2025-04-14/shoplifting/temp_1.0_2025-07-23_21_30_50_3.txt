IN THE CROWN COURT AT LINCOLN  
R v. MR H  
Case No. L2025/08543  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J. MALDRIDGE  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence in respect of a representative charge of theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising from a series of shoplifting incidents occurring over a sustained period, predominantly within the Lincolnshire area. The offending, which has been investigated and prosecuted in this Crown Court, forms part of a wider pattern of acquisitive crime that has drawn concerned attention from local law enforcement, retail security personnel, and community stakeholders alike.

Procedural Background  
You were first arrested on 1 March 2025 following an investigation initiated by Lincolnshire Police in partnership with the Lincolnshire Business Crime Reduction Forum. This investigation was triggered by multiple intelligence reports and witness statements concerning repeated instances of theft across several participating retail outlets, including independent grocers and regional pharmacy chains. While each initial reported offence was relatively minor in isolation, the cumulative data showed a consistent modus operandi and a repeated return to certain premises over a period spanning approximately 18 months. The investigatory phase required a degree of cross-jurisdictional cooperation, involving officers from the Lincolnshire Retail Crime Unit as well as analytical support from the regional crime data office.  

It is worth noting that the Better Case Management (BCM) regime was engaged early in these proceedings, enabling efficient alignment of evidentiary material, disclosure obligations, and pre-trial listing. The hallmark objective of BCM is to optimize case progression, streamline engagement with witnesses, and reduce unnecessary adjournments — goals that, despite occasional difficulty, were broadly realized in this instance. The Crown and defence have cooperated fully in the usual fashion, and I commend counsel on the professional manner in which the case has been conducted thus far.

While the Criminal Procedure Rules offer a framework designed to facilitate the timely and just resolution of criminal disputes, it remains true that cases of low-level theft frequently pose challenges distinct from more serious indictable matters. There is a delicate balance to be struck between judicial economy and ensuring that both prosecution and defence have sufficient opportunity to prepare and present their case effectively. The repeated adjournments driven by Legal Aid application delays and the necessity to obtain expert reports—while regrettable—are indicative of systemic pressures that weigh heavily on the entire criminal justice process at this tier.  

At the plea and trial preparation hearing, you initially entered a not guilty plea, contesting the allegations for some time. However, with the accumulation of detailed surveillance evidence alongside statements from shop staff and investigatory depositions, you entered a guilty plea at the outset of the trial window. This late plea, while at least an admission of responsibility, attracts less credit than an early acceptance of guilt as discussed in the Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Calhoun [2023] EWCA Crim 1204, where it was held that a plea made imminently prior to trial after prolonged denial does not merit maximum mitigation.

The court recognises the pressures experienced by small business proprietors in the retail sector, particularly those operating on narrow margins. The impact of sustained shoplifting on these businesses is not solely economic; it also weighs heavily on staff morale and perceptions of safety. It is, therefore, unsurprising that local police initiatives have encouraged coordination between retail operators through the Business Crime Forum, whose efforts have at times succeeded in disseminating timely intelligence and encouraging targeted interventions. Yet, as has been repeatedly observed in this jurisdiction and others, the effectiveness of such partnerships is often undermined by resource limitations, staff turnover, and fluctuating prioritisation within broader policing strategies.  

This court has previously reflected on the broader social factors contributing to persistent acquisitive offending. As outlined in the Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences, considerable weight is given to the frequency and persistence of offending, the vulnerability of the premises targeted, and the impact upon those affected. These guidelines aid the court in calibrating sentence severity proportionate to harm, culpability, and the offender’s circumstances.  

Of particular importance in this instance is the court’s awareness of ongoing systemic under-resourcing within probation and community rehabilitation services. The stretching of these agencies has wide-reaching effects: increased caseloads reduce the capacity for intensive monitoring and rehabilitative support, while growing waiting lists for psychological treatment notably impede tailored intervention strategies. Reports from the Lincolnshire Probation Trust underscore the challenge of providing timely cognitive behavioural programmes to defendants with entrenched patterns of acquisitive offending.  

During the progress of this matter, a psychiatric report was obtained from Dr Naomi Fletcher, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose detailed assessment identifies certain neurocognitive features that may underlie impulsive tendencies, though there is no diagnosis of major mental illness. Dr Fletcher’s overview is balanced and avoids over-pathologizing; she recommends engagement with community addiction services and cognitive skills training. Nevertheless, she notes insufficient past compliance with recommended interventions and highlights the necessity of structured supervision to mitigate risk of reoffending.

It is worth recording that this case was provisionally scheduled for sentence on 15 September 2025 but was adjourned at the application of the defence to allow for the receipt of supplementary material, including a character reference from a voluntary sector employment agency and a supporting letter from a community mentor involved in Mr H’s engagement with local welfare services. These documents portray a defendant endeavouring to secure stable employment but facing setbacks linked to housing instability and financial hardship. The sincerity of these efforts cannot be discounted, yet they must be weighed against a persistent pattern of dishonesty unable to be reconciled fully with declared aspirations.  

The victimology of this case reflects a recurring theme. The retail establishments targeted include family-run grocers serving socioeconomically diverse catchments. The proprietors have made clear the existential threat posed by cumulative thefts and have expressed frustration at the difficulty of preventing such breaches absent substantive overhauls of store security infrastructure, which in many cases is cost-prohibitive. This has resulted in fewer part-time staff and reduced evening opening hours—alterations that degrade community access and convenience.   

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

The defendant’s previous criminal record reveals multiple prior convictions for similar conduct, including community resolutions and a suspended sentence imposed in 2022 for shoplifting. Despite the apparent deterrent effect of past sanctions, offending was repeated within a comparatively brief interval. The court therefore notes a worrying tendency towards recidivism, compounded by a lack of engagement with rehabilitative resources previously made available.  

A letter from the Probation Service, dated 1 October 2025, drawing upon pre-sentence interview and risk assessment tools, demonstrates Mr H’s limited insight into the causes underpinning his offending behaviour. The report identifies moderate risk factors, including impulsivity, association with peers involved in acquisitive crime, and unmet emotional needs. The Probation Officer advocates for the imposition of a strictly monitored community order incorporating cognitive skills development, financial management support, and a substance misuse programme if necessary.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

During the investigation, investigators received assistance from the Lincolnshire Digital Forensics Unit, which performed an extensive decryption of mobile device data retrieved from Mr H’s residence. The data included location history correlating with retail premises’ CCTV time stamps and communications consistent with planning and coordination of thefts. The forensic analysts' report, dated 24 April 2025, highlighted challenges relating to encryption and deleted messaging histories, necessitating advanced retrieval tools and prolonged analysis. This element of the case illustrates the specialist nature and increasing technological sophistication of contemporary shoplifting investigations, whose rising complexity demands proportionate resource allocation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

The court must also observe that, notwithstanding the intellectual interest such forensics engender, the expenditure of public funds on such operations highlights a tension: significant resource diversion to lower value property crimes, even where evidence is robust, reduces capacity to respond to higher harm offences, including domestic violence and serious youth violence. This is a regrettable but unavoidable reality in modern policing, amplifying the need for effective early intervention and diversion.  

In passing, the court recalls the judgment of R v. Markham [2019] EWCA Crim 1456, which involved a 19-year-old convicted of affray following a street fight involving multiple participants and proximate use of pool cues as improvised weapons. While the facts of Markham are unrelated to this instant case, the appellate discussion on community reintegration and the role of early intervention in preventing escalation bears conceptual relevance to discussions on managing persistent low-level criminality.  

Similarly, it is prudent not to conflate Mr H’s offences with those of a co-defendant in an unrelated matter heard at this court earlier this year—one involving allegations of aggravated trespass and possession of a bladed article on school premises. That case, which progressed to trial in Court 5, was marked by complexities including disputed witness evidence and expert testimony on forensic analysis of recovered weapons. There is no suggestion or connection to the present proceedings, which focus exclusively upon acquisitive offending within retail settings.   

Another digression of limited bearing on the sentencing exercise concerns reports received from the City Environmental Crime Unit, relating to the clearance of illegally dumped construction waste in Greenbelt land near North Hykeham. That case was halted prematurely due to the sudden unavailability of a key witness. While irrelevant to Mr H’s circumstances, it reflects the breadth of challenges facing local enforcement agencies and their resource constraints.  

Returning to the immediate matter: the extensive use of closed-circuit television footage in this case echoes prior commentary regarding evidentiary reliability. It must be borne in mind that surveillance technology, while invaluable, is not infallible. Issues such as camera angle, lighting, and frame rate can complicate identification and time sequencing. Many prosecutions ultimately depend on corroborative testimony, as is the case here, where diligent store staff provided statements and evidence of inventory discrepancies.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

The contributions from local victim support agencies, specifically Lincolnshire Retail Workers' Solidarity Group, are gratefully acknowledged. Their written submission offered a balanced perspective on both the operational challenges posed by repeated shoplifting and the human consequences for affected employees, many of whom experience stress, anxiety, and disrupted working patterns. Such testimony lends weight to the reality that even apparently minor thefts exert a disproportionately negative psychological impact on retail workers.  

In parallel, there exists a recognized challenge in securing timely and effective Legal Aid representation within the county. Notwithstanding improvements, repeated applications to instruct forensic psychology experts have encountered procedural delays, affecting case management timetables. Mr H’s defence team lodged an initial request for funding on 10 April 2025, but formal authorisation was not granted until 3 June 2025 following multiple requests for supplementary information. These delays, although not attributable to counsel or court administration, nevertheless inhibit expeditious resolution and impose additional stress on defendants.  

Mr H’s own statement to probation officers described a history of sporadic employment — largely manual labour and retail work — punctuated by periods of homelessness and temporary accommodation. His reported history includes exposure to adverse childhood experiences, imprecise family structure, and borderline personality traits identified in clinical observations. None of these observations serve as excuse but rather as context to inform appropriate rehabilitative intervention.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

During proceedings, it was disclosed that Mr H has previously had two cohabitants, one of whom was found in possession of cannabis during an unrelated police search in 2022. This fact, while noted, holds no direct bearing on the instant offences and therefore will not influence sentencing considerations.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

The court has also noted correspondence from the probation officer stating an acute shortage of community placements suitable for defendants with similar profiles as Mr H within the Lincolnshire area. This impacts the feasibility of imposing intensive community orders or curfews supplemented by electronic monitoring. The probation service appeals for realistic sentencing options cognizant of local capacity realities.

Turning to jurisprudence relevant to this sentencing exercise, it is instructive to recall the principles established in R v. Jeffries [2020] EWCA Crim 387, where the Court of Appeal emphasised the importance of proportionality in sentencing theft offences, taking into account the offender’s background, the harm caused, and the prospects for rehabilitation. Furthermore, in R v. Taylor [2018] EWCA Crim 1134, the relevance of recognising and appropriately reacting to persistent offending was underscored, particularly in cases where delay in admittance of guilt was a feature.

Finally, the logistics of these proceedings and the courtroom environment deserve brief mention. The Lincoln Crown Court facilities were recently subject to refurbishment, introducing enhanced accessibility and upgrading digital audio systems. It is a matter of regret that the arrival of an ASL interpreter was delayed by an unforeseeable administrative oversight on the morning of this sentencing hearing, leading to a short adjournment. Nonetheless, all participants maintained professionalism throughout these proceedings and the trial judge wishes to record gratitude to the court clerk and ushers for their efforts in managing the day’s protocols.

Having considered all relevant material, legal submissions, and reports, the court is now poised to determine the appropriate sentence. The sentencing framework requires consideration of aggravating and mitigating factors, as well as the overarching aims of punishment: deterrence, rehabilitation, reparation, and protection of the public.

This case presents a defendant with a history of recurring shoplifting offences, the most recent committed despite prior warnings and diversion attempts. The persistence and systemic nature of the offending, coupled with cumulative impact on victims and community confidence, warrant a firm response. Equally, it is evident that rehabilitation potential remains, provided that structured support is delivered in a manner cognizant of Mr H’s needs and circumstances.

In light of the gravity of these matters and cognisant of the broader context outlined, I shall adjourn sentencing to allow for the preparation of an up-to-date pre-sentence report. This report is to contain a
