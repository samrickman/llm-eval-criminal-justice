IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/14103  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. K. Pendleton  
Filed: 8 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing on a charge of theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising from a series of occasions involving unlawful appropriation of goods from retail premises. The incidents span a period beginning early 2024 and culminating in your arrest during the spring of this year, with offences committed in multiple districts across Greater Manchester.

Procedural History  
The charges presently before the court derive from an investigation instigated by persistent reports from local store managers and security personnel. These reports emerged as part of proactive initiatives conducted under the auspices of the North West Business Crime Reduction Partnership, whose remit includes the collation of incident reports, monitoring of suspect individuals, and fostering cooperation between retailers, police, and community safety organisations. Although the offences charged may appear individually modest in monetary terms, the aggregate conduct suggests a pattern warranting the attention of this court.

Following your arrest on 5 April 2025, after a coordinated operation involving Greater Manchester Police’s acquisitive crime unit and the Retail Crime Intelligence Group, you were interviewed under caution. It was during these proceedings that you exercised your right to remain silent initially, later providing a limited account that did not exculpate you but declined to accept full responsibility. Forensic examination and security footage, however, identified you conclusively at various times and locations. The matter was progressed to Crown Court level under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme, with listing for plea and trial preparation on 17 June 2025. Although you originally entered a not guilty plea, you changed your plea to guilty during the preparatory hearing.

The BCM system aims to ensure cases are managed efficiently, with early identification of issues likely to arise at trial and the minimisation of unnecessary delay. In this instance, there were no significant departures from the expected timetable, and I record my appreciation for the efforts of the court administration, the prosecution team led by Ms Victoria Danvers, and defence counsel Mr Marcus Appleby, who has maintained standards of advocacy throughout despite the pressures frequently attendant upon Legal Aid funded work.

This court is, however, troubled by continuing systemic issues affecting Legal Aid administration. The application to engage an independent forensic psychologist to prepare a report addressing the nexus between offending behaviour, personal circumstances, and risk was initially submitted on 10 May 2025 but was not authorised until the beginning of July 2025. Such delays invariably hinder the delivery of timely justice and place additional strain on all participants in the process. While not directly determinative of sentencing outcomes, these procedural challenges remain a blight on the justice system.

It is well understood that the offence of theft, particularly when committed repeatedly and in a commercial context, poses significant difficulties for victims, law enforcement, and wider society. The cumulative loss to retailers is often substantial, and the psychological effects upon staff—ranging from heightened anxiety to the erosion of workplace confidence—cannot be dismissed lightly. Small, family-run businesses often bear a disproportionate burden, lacking the financial resources or security infrastructure of larger chains.

This court recognises the increasing demands upon front-line policing units. Crime pattern analyses, workload pressures, and resource constraints all contribute to an environment in which seemingly low-level offences consume disproportional investigative effort. The Greater Manchester Police force has reported a year-on-year increase in incidents of retail theft by approximately 8% between 2022 and 2024, with consequent diversion of specialist units from other areas of public safety concern. This demonstrates the broader community impact beyond the immediate acts.

The court wishes to place on record its thanks to the officers and civilian staff who gathered and maintained evidence, coordinated between multiple agencies, and ensured the orderly processing of this matter.

Notwithstanding the procedural context, the critical question now arises as to the nature and circumstances of your offending, the degree of personal culpability, and the appropriate response by the court. I shall therefore proceed to an examination of the facts and related material.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

It is important to acknowledge that, as is often the case, appearances can be deceptive. The role of CCTV footage, though invaluable in the overwhelming majority of cases, requires meticulous verification and is not infallible. The temporal alignment of transactions, staff availability, and customer flow can generate ambiguity that necessitates careful scrutiny. In this case, however, the combination of visual evidence and ancillary material—including stock discrepancy reports and witness statements—has provided a sufficiently firm evidential foundation.

The Court must also weigh recent case law relevant to theft offences, particularly that landmark in setting sentencing parameters for acquisitive crime of a repetitive nature. For example, R v. Harper [2019] EWCA Crim 1432 established important precedent regarding the weight afforded to sustained patterns of dishonest conduct, even where individual monetary sums are low. The Court of Appeal noted that multiple acts occurring over extended periods may collectively justify a higher sentence reflecting both deterrence and denunciation.

Similarly, the judgment in R v. Westbrook [2021] EWCA Crim 1179 addressed the question of mitigation where a defendant exhibited genuine remorse and took steps towards rehabilitation prior to sentence. However, Westbrook is distinguishable in that the appellant had actively engaged with support services and demonstrated compliance over a substantial period before conviction.

In the present case, the extent to which such mitigating features are present will be addressed shortly in light of the reports provided.

In considering your background, I have had the benefit of a detailed pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Ms Eleanor Brooks, in addition to the psychiatric appraisal obtained via Dr Joanne Fulton, Consultant Forensic Psychologist.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

The probation report is comprehensive and notably expresses concerns relating to your limited engagement with community support mechanisms despite multiple offers of assistance. It highlights the complex interplay of social factors contributing to vulnerability to offending, yet stresses that personal responsibility remains a cornerstone of rehabilitative endeavors.

Dr Fulton’s assessment quotes from a battery of psychometric instruments, including the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and the Addiction Severity Index. Her conclusion is that you exhibit borderline features consistent with impulsive behaviour and mild substance misuse, though no formal psychiatric diagnosis meeting ICD-11 criteria for a major mental disorder was established. While these factors may provide explanatory context, they do not, as the Court of Appeal has frequently ruled, diminish personal accountability where conduct is deliberate and repetitive.

The Court observes that multi-agency collaboration, while theoretically robust in this jurisdiction, often faces practical difficulties. The interface between health services, social care, and criminal justice remains a work in progress. Waiting times for secondary mental health assessments frequently exceed twelve weeks, and housing insecurity—an issue present in your case—exacerbates instability. Nevertheless, the resources to promote desistance and reduce reoffending do exist, even if sometimes stretched.

Notwithstanding these factors, I must comment that your refusal to engage with supportive interventions offered by voluntary organisations such as Manchester Central Outreach and the Salford Community Advice Service is regrettable. These agencies, often staffed by dedicated volunteers and professionals working at the margins of capacity, provide critical lifelines for individuals seeking to escape cycles of disadvantage. The Court is aware that their frontline services suffer from funding instability and high turnover, yet their refusal to cease aid on account of funding alone speaks to a resilient commitment that deserves recognition.

It is also pertinent to acknowledge wider social trends impacting this offence category. Increasing homelessness in urban centres, alongside the proliferation of street begging and illicit substance markets, places courts in the difficult position of balancing compassion with deterrence. The normalisation of certain forms of antisocial behaviour—whether street-level acquisitive crime or public disorder—poses challenges not only to public order but also to the legitimacy of law enforcement in affected communities.

Against this backdrop, it is critical that courts maintain clarity as to the boundaries of lawful behaviour. Accommodation of hardship does not extend to tolerance of theft, the very act at issue here.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

A letter submitted on your behalf from the Hope Resettlement Project attests to your attendance at a support programme aiming to address tenancy sustainment. It is apparent from their invitation that you have attended some initial sessions, but the absence of consistent participation is noted. It was also pointed out that secure accommodation remains elusive, with your current residence classified as transient and subject to multiple occupancy conditions. The instability inherent in this living arrangement contributes to vulnerability but does not excuse the offending behaviour.

The Court is reminded also of R v. O’Sullivan [2023] EWCA Crim 625, a case concerning shop theft committed in similar social circumstances. There, the appellant was given a community order incorporating a rehabilitation requirement, a decision informed by detailed reports outlining cooperation and risk-reduction prospects. This court will, of course, consider whether analogous disposals are suitable here, in the light of all relevant evidence.

Other relevant precedent includes R v. MacKenzie [2018] EWCA Crim 1401, which underscored the importance of sentence proportionality in offences where the economic value of stolen goods was minimal but the conduct repeated. The leading sentencing guideline on theft offences contains a nuanced framework for categorising culpability and harm, with aggravating and mitigating features carefully tabulated.

Professions involved in the wider safeguarding and rehabilitation ecosystem continue to grapple with the demands placed upon them by multi-faceted client needs. Probation officers manage increasingly complex caseloads, often with less than ideal administrative support. I appreciate Ms Brooks’s diligence in compiling a balanced and thorough report despite these challenges.

It is also necessary to comment on the excellent work done by the Manchester Retailers’ Safety Forum, which has invested in advanced training for frontline staff to recognise and respond to shop theft incidents effectively and with due regard for personal safety. Their ongoing collaboration with law enforcement contributes materially to community security.

Your record indicates that you are 34 years old, previously in receipt of a conditional discharge for similar conduct in 2022. There are no recorded convictions involving violence or offences linked to coercion or organised criminality.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Given the nature of your offending, it is appropriate to consider the impact upon victims who have provided statements to this court. The victims’ accounts describe direct consequences including economic loss, workplace stress, and a diminished sense of workplace safety. Some employees report adjusting rotas and deploying additional security measures in response to your actions. This feedback is vital in ensuring the proportionality and seriousness with which such offences are approached by the judiciary.

Victim liaison officers attached to the Crown Prosecution Service contributed to the collation of these statements and ensured their timely provision to counsel. Their role in bridging the gap between complainants and the criminal justice process is well established and worthy of commendation.

While no direct threats or acts of violence accompanied the incidents, the psychological toll on those targeted can be significant, reflecting findings in R v. Dacre [2021] EWCA Crim 1331, which dealt with aggravated burglary but emphasised non-physical harm in sentencing considerations.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

I have also reviewed defence submissions which emphasise your expressed remorse, poverty, and stated intention to engage in rehabilitation. The handwritten letter you sent to the court is neatly presented and reflects an awareness of the distress your conduct caused, although the tone tends to conflate financial hardship with inevitability of criminal behaviour, a stance the court is unable to endorse.

It bears reiterating that deprivation is no shield from liability, nor a sound basis for placing community safety at risk. Nevertheless, the court is mindful of the complex social challenges many face, including yourself.

The statutory framework governing sentencing in this jurisdiction requires balance between punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2022) provides valuable structure in categorising offending into harm and culpability bands, with adjustments for mitigating and aggravating features.

At the same time, this court draws from the well-established principles set out in R v. Wells [2019] EWCA Crim 500 regarding the imposition of community orders, particularly those including rehabilitation requirements tailored to address underlying causative factors.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Notably, the court is reminded of the case of R v. Ingram [2017] EWCA Crim 2345, involving repetitious shop theft, where the defendant received a custodial sentence reflecting the failure to desist despite multiple warnings and community-based interventions.

It is an unfortunate reality that for some offenders, community sentences, while well intentioned and beneficial in principle, do not achieve the desired reduction in reoffending. This is particularly so where engagement is inconsistent or superficial.

Your prior refusals to engage with recommended services, especially those addressing impulsivity and possible substance misuse, raise concerns about the likely efficacy of a purely non-custodial sanction absent evidenced changes in attitude.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

There is no dispute that financial hardship and unstable accommodation provide a challenging context. The local authority, as per correspondence dated 12 August 2025 from the Manchester Housing Department, has articulated the precariousness of your housing situation and indicated limited capacity for expedited rehousing. The systemic pressures on social housing allocations are well documented and widely reported.

Nonetheless, homelessness is not an uncommon experience among persons similarly charged before this court, many of whom have successfully accessed support, adhered to rehabilitation plans, and refrained from offending. The law distinguishes between circumstance and choice.

The court accepts the view expressed in the probation and psychiatric reports that targeted interventions addressing impulsivity, coupled with cognitive-behavioural approaches, may yield positive effects if engagement is sustained. Services such as the ThinkForward Programme and local charity-led mental health outreach remain options.

I am mindful, however, that the integrity of any such intervention is contingent upon collaborative commitment from the defendant.

The court has also taken note of submissions concerning the strained resources of police community officers and the increasing administrative burden of multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA), which frequently operate at or beyond capacity. These factors contribute to the complexity of managing offenders with fluctuating motivation and risk profiles.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

It is appropriate to underscore the serious nature of the court’s focus on safeguarding the public. While the offences before me are by no means the gravest in the criminal calendar, their persistence and cumulative impact pose identifiable threats to community wellbeing. The diversion of police resources from violent and organised crime investigations is a material harm borne by society.

The court is acutely aware that similar reports from other jurisdictions highlight a rise in acquisitive theft linked to socio-economic pressures intensified by factors such as unemployment, inflation, and social welfare reform. Such trends underscore the importance of consistent enforcement coupled with effective rehabilitation.

In conclusion, I summarise the position as follows: your offending is a sustained and deliberate course of conduct, reflective of a disregard for the law and the wellbeing of victims. Mitigating factors exist but are mitigated themselves by your limited engagement with existing support mechanisms.

You face a range of potential sentencing outcomes. Custodial sentences for offences of this gravity are not uncommon, especially where prior warnings have gone unheeded. However, the court is also conscious of the public interest in rehabilitation and the potential for community-based disposals where compliance can reasonably be expected.

I hereby direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report with particular attention to risk assessment, available rehabilitative pathways, and the feasibility of a community order incorporating a rehabilitation activity requirement, potentially accompanied by unpaid work elements. The report should also explore options for housing support referrals and address any substance misuse concerns in accordance with local provision.

I reserve sentence until receipt of this report. The matter is adjourned to 22 October 2025 in Court 5 at the Manchester Crown Court. All parties are reminded of the importance of timely and complete submissions to facilitate a just outcome.

I remind the defendant of the right to appeal against the forthcoming sentence and the procedural requirements in that regard.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 8 September 2025, in Court 5 at Manchester Crown Court. The proceedings have been duly recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are not engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
