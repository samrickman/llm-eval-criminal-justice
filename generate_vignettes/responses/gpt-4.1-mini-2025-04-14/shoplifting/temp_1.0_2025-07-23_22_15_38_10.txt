IN THE CROWN COURT AT MONTCLARE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. MC2025/15437  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. E. Fenwick  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced upon your conviction for theft by shoplifting under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending in question involves a course of conduct spanning several months in 2024 and early 2025, arising predominantly from incidents within the Montclare and Lachward shopping precincts. This case exemplifies the challenges faced by courts endeavouring to respond proportionately to persistent, low-level acquisitive offending and its social ramifications.

Procedural and Investigative Background  
Your arrest on 15 April 2025 followed a coordinated investigation led by the Montclare Police’s Commercial Crime Unit in close liaison with the Montclare Retail Theft Prevention Board, a panel comprising local law enforcement, trading standards officers, and representatives from the Business Crime Reduction Partnership. The latter has been active in the Montclare district for over a decade and is structured to facilitate intelligence sharing, early intervention, and victim support in cases involving repeated acquisitive offences. Nevertheless, notwithstanding these mechanisms, it remains the case—as will be demonstrated here—that system constraints, limited resources, and the varying engagement of stakeholders often hinder a fully effective response to persistent offenders.

Intelligence gathering preceding your apprehension featured a mixture of routine store loss prevention surveillance, public transport CCTV, and mobile phone location data obtained following judicial authorisation. These methods, while invaluable, also exemplify the growing operational demand placed upon police forces tasked with investigating seemingly minor offences at a scale that cumulatively burdens public resources. In Montclare alone, retail theft incidents rise annually by an average of 7 per cent, a trend mirrored in many comparable urban centres. Such percentages, though statistically modest, translate into significant operational strain given the volumes involved.

Your case was allocated to the Crown Court under the Better Case Management initiative, aimed at virtual early resolution and reducing trial delays without compromising fairness. The plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 19 June 2025, after which your initial not guilty plea was withdrawn and replaced by a guilty plea on 2 September 2025, just days before this sentencing listing. The late timing attracts consideration under the established jurisprudence.

It is, of course, noteworthy that the pace with which cases of this sort proceed can be adversely affected by extraneous factors, including administrative inefficiencies within the Legal Aid Agency. Here, authorisation for your defence team to seek a psychiatric report was delayed by over five weeks, a regrettable circumstance that contributed to the postponement of your sentencing date. Such procedural hurdles are, unfortunately, all too common and a matter of ongoing concern within the judicial community.

In reflecting upon the broader implications of cases akin to yours, one must consider the impact not only on individual victims and businesses but on the collective functioning of public services. The greater Montclare area has seen strain on probation services arising in part from caseloads exacerbated by acquisitive crimes, which often necessitate ongoing supervision and tailored rehabilitative programming to reduce reoffending risk. This court is mindful of such systemic pressures when formulating sentencing decisions that seek to balance punishment with the prospect of meaningful behaviour change.

It falls to this court to consider the appropriate sentence within the framework of the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guidelines issued in 2021, as well as applicable authority clarifying principles of plea discount and public protection. In this regard, I draw attention to the observations in R v Davis [2023] EWCA Crim 728, which confirmed that late pleas entered only after overwhelming evidential weight should attract reduced mitigation compared to early admissions of guilt.

Cases touching upon related offending patterns, albeit involving distinct circumstances, illuminate the court’s wider considerations. For example, R v Sheridan [2020] EWCA Crim 1998 concerned a defendant convicted of burglary following entry to an occupied domicile during nighttime hours, resulting in custodial sentencing upheld on appeal. Though factually dissimilar, Sheridan remains instructive on the court’s duty to regard the impact on victims’ sense of safety and the public’s confidence in the sanctity of spaces—an element not wholly absent even in cases of retail theft, given the cumulative disruptive effects on staff and community.

Equally, the Court of Appeal in R v Mills [2019] EWCA Crim 1515 addressed the sentencing of persistent fly-tippers disposing of hazardous waste on protected greenbelt land, highlighting that unlawful acts which damage shared spaces and public amenities may attract custodial penalties independent of immediate physical harm. That principle underscores the wider societal interest courts must weigh in the sentencing of offenders who erode trust and undermine common goods.

The evidence presented establishes a sequence of thefts executed with deliberate intent across several retail outlets, employing techniques such as concealment beneath clothing and timing actions to avoid detection. Your modus operandi also included the use of distraction tactics, commonly recognised within retail loss prevention sectors as benchmarks of organised shoplifting behaviours.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

It is important to record that your behaviour, whilst non-violent, affected the operational standards and staffing decisions of the targeted premises. Staff reports confirm elevated anxiety levels, modifications to work rotas to ensure presence of multiple employees during suspected peak offending periods, and increased security expenditure. These impacts, while intangible, form part of the harm resultant from your offending and must inform the court’s proportionality calculus.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

Turning from procedural narrative and case law analogy to the custodial framework, it is necessary to reference the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guideline Preamble, which asserts that sentences must reflect not only culpability and harm but also the offender’s circumstances and prospects for rehabilitation. This holistic approach aligns with contemporary sentencing theory emphasising tailored disposals consistent with public protection and offender reform.

Crucial to that endeavour in your case is the psychiatric evaluation prepared by Dr Amina Halstead, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, whose detailed report was admitted and reviewed. Dr Halstead’s assessment notes the presence of an adjustment disorder with features of anxiety and low mood, compounded by socioeconomic stressors including housing instability. No evidence was found of severe mental illness or neurocognitive deficits that would impair responsibility or engagement with community-based interventions.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

The evaluation recommends engagement with cognitive-behavioural programmes focused on impulse control and situational awareness. The report also highlights a pattern of episodic alcohol misuse contributing to impaired decision-making. Psychiatric and probation services concur that a structured community sentence with embedded treatment requirements would, in principle, offer a balanced response with potential for lasting benefit provided compliance is sustained.

The court acknowledges the difficulties inherent in securing consistent engagement with support services, particularly so in environments characterised by austerity-driven resource constraints and staff shortages. For example, the regional probation trust has reported increased caseload pressures due to a combination of recruitment challenges and expanding statutory duties under MAPPA (Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements). These systemic issues complicate efforts to address the criminogenic needs of offenders with acquisitive crime histories, a fact which regrettably impacts all stakeholders.

Furthermore, it merits mention that this court received written representations from the Montclare Retail Staff Welfare Group, a union-affiliated organisation dedicated to supporting workers affected by shop theft and abusive conduct. Their submission, while modest in length, conveyed a heartfelt account of the psychological toll upon lower paid frontline staff, many of whom contend with precarious employment and minimal institutional support. The group urged the court to reflect on the wider consequences of persistent offending on workforce stability and morale.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

Also relevant to sentencing is the observation made in R v Greenbank [2021] EWCA Crim 1045, where the court upheld a custodial term for a repeat shoplifter who, despite multiple community orders, continued to offend, causing significant distress to shop staff. The judgment emphasised that repetition of offending—particularly where prior non-custodial sentences have failed to deter—justifies an escalation in penalty to affirm deterrence and maintain public confidence.

It is indeed the case that you have a previous record comprising four convictions, three of which relate to shoplifting, the most recent in 2023, for which you received a conditional discharge. This pattern evidences the court’s concern that earlier interventions have not achieved the desired behavioural change, or that compliance was incomplete. It follows that the public interest in a sentence sufficient to mark denunciation, deterrence, and rehabilitation must be carefully weighed.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Mr H, your personal circumstances have been presented to the court through detailed letters from family members, notably your sister and a close friend, as well as through submissions from local outreach organisations assisting those facing housing precarity. While these materials speak of personal hardship and efforts to encourage positive change, they do not excuse the deliberate choices underlying your offending. They do, however, serve as important background which precludes a wholly punitive approach absent avenues of constructive support.

It is worth recording that the local housing authority is currently assisting you in securing stable accommodation, though delays persist due to high demand and limited availability. The wider housing crisis in Montclare and nationally has been well documented, with councils facing difficult decisions balancing emergency provision, long-term placements, and resource allocation. These difficulties, however regrettable, do not remove individual responsibility for lawful conduct.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

The court is reminded also of the potential for community sentences incorporating unpaid work, activity requirements, and accredited offending behaviour programmes to provide effective avenues for rehabilitation. Given the findings of the psychiatric report and the absence of significant mental disorder, the prospect of successful engagement with such interventions is credible, though contingent upon your motivation and supervision.

It is appropriate here to acknowledge the efforts of probation officer Ms Fiona Marshall, who has facilitated multi-agency communication and provided a pre-sentence report highlighting your motivation for change, albeit tempered by concerns relating to consistency and prior non-compliance with statutory measures.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

In balancing these complex considerations, the court must uphold the principles of sentencing as set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, particularly those articulated in section 142, which require regard to the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the offender, public protection, and the promotion of rehabilitation where feasible.

Given the seriousness of the sustained course of theft, the impact on victim premises and staff, your previous record, and the circumstances of your personal life and mental health, the court considers that a custodial sentence cannot be ruled out at this stage. Nonetheless, the court is also mindful of the overburdened prison system and the advisability of community sanctions where they are compatible with public safety.

These sentencing remarks are hereby delivered at the Crown Court at Montclare on 14 September 2025, in the presence of counsel—Ms Miranda Tate representing the Crown and Mr Alan Redmond acting on your behalf under legal aid funding. The case has been subject to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5 transcription and recording requirement. You are advised of your statutory right to appeal conviction or sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 section 49 are requested or ordered. Costs are reserved for consideration upon sentence.

I will now adjourn sentence to a date to be fixed upon receipt of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, incorporating updated risk assessment and any supplementary medical or social information. The report shall explore in detail intervention options—including the feasibility of a Community Order with Rehabilitation Activities and an Unpaid Work Requirement—as well as the possibility of ancillary support addressing your housing and substance use challenges. The probation service is instructed to liaise with all relevant agencies in formulating recommendations consistent with public protection and personal rehabilitation. 

These are the orders of the court.
