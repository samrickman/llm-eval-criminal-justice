IN THE CROWN COURT AT BLAKEMORE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. C2025/18439  
Sentencing Remarks — His Honour Judge J. L. CARTER  
Filed: 17 August 2025

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence upon your conviction for theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising from a series of incidents occurring over an eighteen-month period predominantly within the commercial districts of Blakemore and its adjacent boroughs. The offending spans a protracted period and has been the subject of close investigation reflective of the prevalent concerns regarding acquisitive crime in urban retail environments.

Procedural Background  
The matter was initially brought before the magistrates’ court on 12 March 2025 following your arrest on 3 March 2025. The arrest emanated from an operation coordinating several agencies, including the Blakemore Retail Crime Taskforce, the Metropolitan Police’s Digital Forensics Unit, and the Safer City Partnership. These agencies collaborated to develop an offender profile based on patterns of emerging incidents affecting a series of independent and chain stores, many of which reported repeated losses attributed to a singular individual resembling your description. The investigative process involved collation of disparate CCTV footage, witness accounts, and asset recovery logs.

The court notes that the initial police enquiry required extensive cross-agency communication, underscoring the often-excessive demands placed upon law enforcement in the investigation of low-level property offences. The risks of resource misallocation are a matter of concern in cases such as this, and it is the better cooperation and prioritisation that allows for such complex cases to be brought before the Crown Court efficiently, as in this instance.

Your case was transferred to the Crown Court following the granting of due authority under the Better Case Management scheme, a mechanism designed to expedite early resolution and ensure judicial economy. The plea and trial preparation hearing scheduled for 7 May 2025 was, however, adjourned on the application of your defence team pending the outcome of a psychiatric report and further expert evidence concerning your mental state and risk profile. I express my thanks to Dr Miriam Eastwood, consultant forensic psychologist, and Probation Officer Matthew Lang for their thorough and professionally composed reports, notwithstanding some procedural delays caused by difficulties in obtaining Legal Aid funding for expert instruction.

The BCM framework, now in its second decade, continues to represent an important development in the procedural administration of criminal justice, notwithstanding occasional operational challenges. Its initial conception was to overhaul protracted pre-trial delays which were commonplace in the early 2000s, and, while not a panacea, it has significantly reduced backlogs and improved case progression in the majority of instances.

There was, regrettably, a delay attributable to the processing of your Legal Aid application for further specialist advice, specifically regarding an assessment of underlying neurodevelopmental difficulties, which was only authorised after several weeks of correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency’s complex case unit. This is indicative of a broader systemic issue, which has been observed across numerous courts and has resulted in inefficiencies that harm both defendants’ access to justice and the smooth operation of the court.

This is well-documented. The Legal Aid Agency’s constantly evolving procedural protocols, while intended to streamline financial oversight, have instead frequently introduced uncertainty into the defence preparation phase. This is not unique to your case, but it serves as yet another example of the ongoing need for reform in funding mechanisms for forensic expertise, particularly where vulnerability and risk assessment may influence sentencing.

Your matter was again listed for sentence on 13 August 2025, the date of this hearing, with all procedural elements in place. I have had the benefit of reviewing all relevant materials, including witness statements, victim impact statements, probation records, expert psychiatric and psychological reports, and representations from both the prosecution and defence, which I consider in due course.

It is appropriate to note at this juncture the valuable role played by the retail support forum and local business community groups, such as the Blakemore Retailers’ Association and the Community Safety Advisory Panel. Their measured and constructive engagement with this matter, articulated through detailed victim impact statements, is reflective of a sector keenly affected by the cumulative effects of persistent shop theft. The economic footprint, loss of customer confidence, and the resultant psychological strain on shop staff are well recognised consequences and are formally recorded in the suite of material before the court.

It would be remiss not to observe, though tangential to this matter, that the ongoing strain upon retail business owners and employees is compounded by wider social forces currently confronting this jurisdiction. The steady encroachment of economic uncertainty, increased street homelessness, and the related proliferation of anti-social behaviours have coalesced into a challenging environment for local commerce. The court’s position is that this context, while not a mitigation, must be understood as the backdrop to the offences.

Embedded within the broader frame of acquisitive crime and retail theft is the question of public confidence in law enforcement and judicial process. These are concerns that reach beyond any individual defendant but which underline the importance of consistent, principled judicial responses to patterns of offending, even where conduct is characterised as “low level” or “non-violent.” Such offences, if left unchecked, have a corrosive effect on community safety and well-being.

As you are no doubt aware, your initial plea was one of not guilty, entered at the earliest opportunity, namely the first hearing in magistrates’ court on 12 March 2025. However, following service of further photographic and forensic evidence, including weighty CCTV footage and analysis provided by the Blakemore Police Digital Evidence Unit, your plea was changed to guilty at the Crown Court hearing on 6 August 2025.

The court reiterates that the timing of guilty pleas has a material impact on sentencing discounts, as established in a series of Court of Appeal decisions, including R v Meyer [2023] EWCA Crim 84 and R v Quilliam [2022] EWCA Crim 1523. The principle that later pleas confer reduced credit is rooted in both recognition of the impact on victims and the justice system and the desire to incentivise early admissions of guilt.

It is regrettable, though unsurprising, that late guilty pleas remain prevalent amongst defendants charged with acquisitive offences, a phenomenon extensively analysed in recent academic studies commissioned by the Ministry of Justice.

Legal Context  
The offence of theft, as you are well-aware, is codified in section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968, defined as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intent to permanently deprive the other of it. The jurisprudence surrounding the definition and application of dishonesty—including the notable test set out in R v Ghosh [1982] and subsequently refined by Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67—is well settled and was applied during your trial.

The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences remains the principal framework for determining the appropriate sentence in cases such as yours. The guideline requires consideration of several factors, including the value of goods stolen, the sophistication and degree of planning behind the offending, any previous convictions, and the impact on any victims.

Whilst your offending attracted no physical violence or threats, aggravating factors are noted, including the repetitive nature of the conduct, the targeting of vulnerable retail premises, and the associated distress caused to staff and customers alike.

Reference is made to the decision in R v Armitage [2021] EWCA Crim 1719, where the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence for a defendant engaged in serial shoplifting at multiple outlets, noting that deterrent sentencing is appropriate where offenders display persistent disregard for community obligations and prior cautionary interventions.

Further, R v Lawson [2019] EWCA Crim 225 provided clarification on the application of appropriate custodial thresholds for theft relating to goods valued under £200, emphasizing the importance of considering context, offender history, and behavioural patterns.

I also take judicial notice of R v Donovan [2020] EWCA Crim 1356, where the court dealt with an aggravated shoplifting case that included tampering with security devices. Although your case does not involve such direct interference with security infrastructure, the principle that deliberate, repeated targeting of specific items over time constitutes aggravation remains pertinent.

In light of these authorities, the offences before this court, singular on indictment but reflective of a broader course of conduct, demand close scrutiny.

This court acknowledges the significance of the modus operandi as presented. The deliberate use of distraction techniques observed in this case is indicative of calculated intent rather than spontaneous opportunism. The orchestration of accomplices or diversionary tactics, while absent in your case, feature prominently in aggravating scenarios in related jurisprudence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

As the court has been informed, this case notably does not involve violence, nor any form of personal threat toward staff or bystanders. Nevertheless, the manner of your offending triggered significant emotional disturbance among retail workers, many of whom reported increased anxiety as a result.

The psychological toll on shop employees subjected to recurrent theft and intimidation, even absent physical aggression, is recognised as a serious impact in sentencing assessments. It is important not to understate this point.

It would be instructive to recall the observations made in R v Abernethy [2018] EWCA Crim 1128, concerning offences where no direct harm was caused yet distress to vulnerable victims was sufficiently serious to merit custodial sentences.

It would be remiss not to mention, as an aside, that the present court considers the exacerbating impact when offences overlap with periods of community tension or social unrest, as was the case in a separate prosecution involving aggravated criminal damage to a church noticeboard during Easter 2024. While unrelated to your case, such events compound public disorder and cannot be ignored in broader sentencing considerations.

The court is also cognisant of the wider context in which urban retail theft takes place, including the increasing sophistication of offenders utilising digital technologies to identify vulnerabilities, such as gaps in CCTV coverage or under-resourced staffing hours.

Offences such as the theft of copper wiring from rail depots or the possession of bladed articles within school car parks have garnered significant media attention and public disquiet but remain factually distinct from the present matter. This court references them only insofar as they demonstrate the breadth and complexity of acquisitive offences landscape confronting public authorities.

In the present case, multi-agency collaboration has meant that your movements were tracked comprehensively over a two-week period culminating in your arrest. This form of sustained investigative effort is resource-intensive and, regrettably, increasingly necessary to tackle persistent low-level offenders.

Several recent operations conducted by the city's law enforcement authorities, including a joint task force involving highway police and trading standards officials, focused on issues ranging from fly-tipping on green belt land to fraudulent benefit claims uncovered through complex financial audits. Though these matters bear no direct relevance to you as an individual, they illustrate the broad portfolio of challenges faced by agencies tasked with maintaining public order and safety.

Your personal circumstances, as reported in the probation assessment and corroborated during testimony, include a history of unstable accommodation and periods of unemployment. The probation service notes your mixed engagement with voluntary support schemes, a factor undoubtedly relevant to your risk assessment. The Probation Officer also records concerns regarding your impulsivity and inconsistent compliance with prior community interventions.

The psychiatric report authored by Dr Eastwood provides a detailed exposition of your mental health status, including observed traits consistent with mild neurodivergence, and an inconclusive question of attentional deficits. While no major psychiatric disorder was diagnosed, the report cautions against underestimating the potential role that such factors may play in your decision-making and behavioural controls.

The court observes the ongoing difficulty faced by the National Health Service and affiliated mental health providers in managing waitlists and timely assessments, a problem acknowledged in the recent national strategy review published by the Department of Health and Social Care in April 2025. Such systemic challenges, while not a justification for offending behaviour, form a relevant background to your case and the broader question of public protection balanced against rehabilitative opportunity.

There is a notable absence in the record of substantive engagement with addiction services, despite indications of periodic substance misuse. The voluntary sector, including agencies like Helping Hands Outreach and the Urban Renewal Trust, continue to cope with significant demand well beyond their operational capacities.

The court is aware of correspondence from the City Food Bank Network expressing concern about the demographic changes in client profiles over the past two years, specifically an increase in individuals experiencing transient homelessness—a factor linked in some studies to patterns of acquisitive offending. Your accommodation status during the period of offending, as provided to probation, includes brief tenancy in supported housing and intervals of temporary shelter.

Extensive liaison with community policing officers has produced mixed reports: while some officers commend your courteous engagement during contacts, others note evasive responses and avoidance of follow-up meetings.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

Let it be said plainly: public safety demands a balance between recognising individual vulnerability and holding accountable those who flout community norms. Courts are not places of punishment alone, but nor are they venues for unchecked leniency.

It has long been accepted in sentencing jurisprudence, including seminal authority such as R v Roberts [2005] EWCA Crim 1234, that persistence and escalation in acquisitive offending warrant progressively firm responses.

The sentencing guideline issued by the Sentencing Council in its 2018 consolidated theft offences guidance remains authoritative. The guideline explicitly cautions courts about the cumulative effect of multiple small thefts, noting that an aggregated approach may be necessary to reflect the true gravity.

Your prior conviction record, which includes several previous shoplifting offences over the past decade, was appropriately disclosed and considered by the probation officer. While recognising your expressed remorse and acknowledgement of wrongfulness, the number and frequency of prior interventions suggest a pattern of behaviour not readily altered by past community sentences.

The court is mindful of the observation in R v Baines [2017] EWCA Crim 1678, which emphasised the importance
