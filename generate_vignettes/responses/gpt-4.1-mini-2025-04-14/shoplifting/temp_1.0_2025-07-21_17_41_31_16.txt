IN THE CROWN COURT AT HAYES  
R v. MR H  
Case No. H2025/05420  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. B. MERCER  
Filed: 16 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following a conviction by way of a guilty plea to an offence of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending charged and proved represents a persistent pattern of shoplifting spanning a period from early 2024 through to the spring of this year. The offences occurred in multiple commercial locations within the borough of Hillingdon and its environs, primarily targeting small-scale retail businesses including convenience stores and independent pharmacies.

Procedural History  
This matter was first listed at the Magistrates’ Court on 5 July 2025, after you were arrested on 23 June 2025, pursuant to investigations undertaken by Hillingdon Borough Command of the Metropolitan Police Service in conjunction with the local Retail Crime Partnership (RCP). The case was swiftly transferred to the Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme designed to expedite the progression of cases requiring more detailed directions and pre-sentence evaluation. I note that the plea and trial preparation hearing was initially scheduled for 18 August 2025, at which stage you entered an equivocal plea of not guilty, before changing to a plea of guilty on the morning of trial on 10 September 2025.  

The initial period of delay prior to entering the plea was largely attributable to requests from the defence for the instruction of a forensic forensic psychologist with recognised expertise in the assessment of recurrent acquisitive offending and the impact of socio-economic stressors on offending behaviour. Those applications required authorisation through the Legal Aid Agency, whose procedural inefficiencies undoubtedly contributed to prolonged delays in obtaining relevant expert opinion. The court notes with regret that similar delays in the commissioning of reports from the NHS and independent providers continue to place undue strain upon the timely administration of justice, particularly in cases involving vulnerable defendants.  

It is a matter of record that the court was assisted by a comprehensive probation report prepared by Mr George Jennings, probation officer, whose detailed account of your background, criminogenic needs, and recent engagement with voluntary support services has significantly informed the court’s understanding of your circumstances. Additionally, a psychiatric assessment by Dr Hannah O’Neill, consultant psychiatrist, was admitted, providing further insight into mental health considerations which, while not absolving responsibility, warrant careful attention in the formulation of sentence.

It is pertinent at this juncture to observe some systemic pressures affecting the agencies involved. The probation service in Hillingdon, whilst making commendable efforts in the facilitation of offender management and rehabilitation, faces notable staffing shortages, with a turnover rate exceeding 25% in the past year. This inevitably impacts the availability of timely pre-sentence reports and ongoing supervision. Likewise, the Retail Crime Partnership is operating with significantly reduced funding following a recent withdrawal of corporate sponsorship, limiting its capacity for enhanced surveillance and victim support initiatives. Nonetheless, representations from local business owners submitted to this court testify to their continued resolve, despite these constraints, to mitigate the economic and psychological impact of repeat offenders on the high street.  

Legal Context and Case Law  
The offence of theft pursuant to the Theft Act 1968 is well-established in statute and common law. The offence defined by section 1 requires proof of dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it. In determining sentence, the court is guided by the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline for Theft Offences (published April 2012, updated 2023), which distinguishes between single incidents and sustained courses of conduct, placing emphasis on factors such as premeditation, planning, the value of stolen goods, vulnerability of victims, and use of threats or coercion.  

While the present case does not involve violence or threats, the deliberate and repetitive nature of the offending over months necessitates a proportionate response. In particular, I take note of the precedent established in R v. Moss [2019] EWCA Crim 305, where the court upheld a sentence of 10 months’ custody for an individual who committed multiple shoplifting offences over an extended period, characterised by the use of concealment devices and repeated returns to affected shops. The Court of Appeal emphasised that although each individual theft may have involved low monetary value, the persistence and disrespect for community welfare warranted a custodial sentence.  

Similarly, R v. Calderon [2022] EWCA Crim 1428 is instructive. In Calderon, the offender was convicted of a series of retail thefts involving sophisticated methods of concealment and distraction, with consequent adverse impacts on staff morale and business viability. The appellate court stressed that low-level but sustained offending should not be underestimated in terms of its cumulative harm and effect on public confidence in retail environments. The decision reinforces the principle that sentencing must both reflect the seriousness of the overall pattern and act as a deterrent.  

It is also appropriate to record reference to R v. Baines [2020] EWCA Crim 613, in which the sentencing judge imposed a community order with a substantial unpaid work element for a first-time offender engaged in shoplifting resulting from a moment of economic desperation. The court acknowledged mitigating circumstances, including early plea and acceptance of responsibility. That case is distinguishable from the present circumstances in that it involved a discrete act with immediate guilty plea and demonstrable engagement with support services.  

Additionally, R v. Khan [2018] EWCA Crim 1022 concerned a defendant charged with aggravated burglary, who was sentenced to a custodial term reflecting the aggravated nature of the intrusion and threat to personal safety for occupants. While unrelated in terms of offence type, the case is a reminder that custodial sentences serve not only to punish but also to protect the public from serious criminal conduct.  

It is within this legal and policy framework that I proceed to assess the facts and circumstances of the present matter.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

To provide context, it is necessary to acknowledge some of the operational challenges faced by retail business proprietors in the Hillingdon area over recent years. Persistent issues around security funding, employee turnover, and the diversion of police resources towards more serious crime have at times left smaller shops vulnerable to opportunistic theft. The economic squeeze facing independent retailers—already burdened by rising costs, reduced footfall, and the impact of online competitors—has been exacerbated by repeated shrinkage from shoplifting. Such factors have implications beyond immediate financial loss, including the wellbeing of staff and ongoing business viability, which further underscore the seriousness with which the court must treat offences of this nature.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

It bears observation that none of the incidents in this case involved violence or coercion towards staff or customers. However, as established by authority and parliamentary guidance, the absence of physical aggression does not diminish the offence’s gravity where repeated breaches erode confidence and cause distress. This is rightly acknowledged by the Retail Crime Partnership in its correspondence dated 12 August 2025, which emphasises the psychological toll upon employees, including reports of anxiety, disrupted shift patterns, and a diminished sense of workplace safety.  

Alongside the police, numerous voluntary sector agencies have attempted to engage with you to address underlying causes of offending, including financial hardship and psychosocial stressors. The West London Community Trust, a non-governmental organisation specialising in offender rehabilitation and housing support, provided written submissions outlining attempts to establish contact, support access to benefits, and facilitate attendance at counselling sessions. Despite these efforts, engagement has been partial and inconsistent.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

It is worthwhile at this point to mention that your case was somewhat complicated by initial identification difficulties. Forensic retrieval of surveillance footage was hampered by poor lighting and low-quality cameras in certain premises. The timely intervention of the multi-agency Crime Reduction Unit, however, enabled enhanced collation of evidence. The court extends its thanks to the unit, which continues to operate under significant operational constraints due to budget cuts and redeployment. Such units are critical in providing the exacting evidential standards necessary for prosecution, particularly in cases where circumstantial or indirect evidence may be subject to challenge.  

It is pertinent to observe that on one occasion, separate from the offences charged against you, there was an incident involving a co-defendant, Mr A. Smith, who assaulted store security personnel with a chair during an attempted arrest following a break-in in a neighbouring borough. Mr Smith’s conduct, including damage to property and assaults on officers, forms no part of your factual matrix but is noted here for the completeness of the court record.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Prior to your arrest, you had been the subject of a community resolution scheme administered by Hillingdon Police in November 2024 for an unrelated allegation of possession of a bladed article in a school car park. That matter was dealt with without prosecution, subject to a warning and referral to youth offending services. No further offences of that nature or involving weapons have been associated with you or your immediate associations.  

It is also noted that a sibling of yours, currently subject to unrelated criminal proceedings in the Magistrates' Court for benefit fraud, has no direct bearing upon your case. Your family circumstances have been explored insofar as they bear upon any mitigating factors and are reflected in the pre-sentence report.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The cumulative harm arising from your offending is reflected not only in the financial losses attributable to stolen stock but also in heightened anxiety and operational disruption to the affected businesses. In their letters submitted to this court, several proprietors speak of lost income, revised staffing rotas, and a consequent unwillingness to undertake new employment commitments. The Retail Support and Recovery Network has also provided a statement outlining systemic trends in repeat thefts and the flow-on effects for small businesses reliant on thin profit margins. Such impacts, while not of immediate physical harm, represent genuine societal and economic detriments.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Mental Health and Risk Assessments  
Dr Hannah O’Neill’s psychiatric evaluation concluded, upon examination, that you do not suffer from any enduring mental illness warranting a finding of diminished responsibility or unfitness to plead. However, she noted traits consistent with chronic stress related to financial instability and moderate depressive symptomatology. There is no indication of psychosis, personality disorder, or severe substance misuse, although the latter was considered as a contributory factor by the probation officer based on your self-reported history.  

Risk evaluation placed you in a medium-risk category for reoffending, primarily due to the lack of sustained engagement with interventions and the persistence of basic criminogenic needs. The report underscores the pressing need for structured supervision and support in addressing impulsivity and situational triggers for offending.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The pre-sentence report by Mr George Jennings provides a detailed background, confirming your current residence in temporary accommodation provided through the Hillingdon Borough Housing Department. It records your recent unemployment status and the absence of steady income, along with limited family support. The report also notes your expressed intention to seek employment and engage with financial management services, though these ambitions have yet to translate into concrete action.  

Mr Jennings comments on the importance of community-based interventions and the court’s consideration of possible rehabilitative pathways in preference to custodial sentences where appropriate. He highlights your willingness to comply with court directions and acknowledges your expressed remorse.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Reference should also be made to the longstanding difficulties faced by the National Health Service in meeting demands for mental health services. Waiting lists for non-urgent referrals routinely exceed six months in many parts of Greater London, including Hillingdon. These systemic pressures add further complexity to cases involving defendants with psychosocial vulnerabilities. It is not the function of this court to comment at length on health policy; nevertheless, such realities form part of the wider landscape in which justice is administered.  

Public service agencies, including Probation, NHS Mental Health Trusts, and social housing providers, are increasingly expected to collaborate effectively under multi-agency risk assessment conferences (MARAC) and multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA). In your case, no current MAPPA referral has been made, reflecting the absence of serious risk indicators. Nonetheless, the coordination of support remains essential for reducing recidivism.

In relation to the administration of Legal Aid, this court notes with continued concern the endemic delays in the authorisation of funding for expert reports and specialist representation. The Legal Aid Agency’s correspondence lodged demonstrates that there was a delay of some six weeks before approval was granted for the instruction of Dr O’Neill, despite repeated liaison from your solicitor, Mr Piers Richardson. These delays compound pressures on the courts and risk undermining defendants’ rights to timely and effective representation.  

There is a further procedural note: an interpreter was required for a family member visiting the court on behalf of the defence but arrived late, delaying the listing on two occasions. The court expresses appreciation for the professionalism of the court usher and clerks in managing these disruptions while maintaining a calm and orderly environment for proceedings. The courtroom itself was recently refurbished with improved access facilities and updated security screening technology, reflecting ongoing investment in the infrastructure supporting the hearing of cases.  

Victim Impact and Community Consequences  
Although there are no direct individual victims identifiable by name, the businesses affected have collectively articulated the significance of the offence. Letters from several retailers describe the burdens imposed by repeat offending, including costs of replacement stock, installation of enhanced security measures, and turnover of staff unwilling to remain in roles associated with frequent conflict or theft.  

The Retail Support and Recovery Network emphasises that such offending, while superficially minor in financial terms, contributes cumulatively to broader economic fragility in local high streets. This has knock-on effects on employment, community vibrancy, and public confidence in the safety of local shopping environments.  

The court is acutely aware that no prosecution takes place in isolation of its social milieu. The gradual erosion of trust in public order institutions, the staggering rise in street homelessness particularly in West London areas, and the normalisation of antisocial behaviour all constitute background factors that shape judicial response. Nonetheless, sentencing must remain focused on the individual defendant, weighing personal circumstances against the public interest.  

Sentencing Considerations  
In light of all the above, I find that the offence must be regarded as one of moderate to significant seriousness, given its repeated and planned nature, the economic and psychological impact on local businesses, and your prior contact with the justice system.  

While the late plea of guilty is noted, reflecting some acceptance of responsibility, it came only after an evidential case of considerable strength had been assembled and communicated to the defence. Accordingly, the credit for mitigation of sentence on this basis is limited. The principles set down in R v. Hooper [2016] EWCA Crim 385, concerning the cautious approach to deferred pleas, are applicable.  

Mitigating factors include your expressed remorse, partial cooperation, and the absence of antecedents involving violence or serious harm. Your current engagement with probation services and some willingness to access support services are positive markers, albeit fragile.  

Custodial sentence remains a possibility given the pattern of offending and previous interventions, including community resolutions and warnings, have failed to deter you. However, the court must balance deterrence and punishment with the prospect of rehabilitation and public protection, taking into account the constraints imposed by structural factors such as housing insecurity and mental health.  

I therefore direct the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report with a focus on identifying realistic and structured community-based interventions potentially suitable for you. These may include cognitive-behavioural programmes targeting acquisitive behaviour, financial management assistance, and an activity requirement promoting community cohesion. Such options, if viable, would serve both your interests and those of society.  

It is emphasised that failure to engage with such programmes, should sentence permit, will be viewed seriously upon any future proceedings.  

Acknowledgments & Conclusion  
I acknowledge the work of Ms Jessica Thornton for the Crown and Mr Piers Richardson for the defence, both of whom presented their submissions with appropriate professionalism and clarity under challenging conditions.  

This case provides a clear illustration of the incremental strain placed on public services—law enforcement, the courts, probation, health, and charitable sectors—in managing what might superficially appear as low-level crime but in reality constitutes an enduring threat to community stability.  

It is hoped that your forthcoming engagement with support services will provide a pathway away from reoffending. The court is mindful that sustainable change requires more than admonition; it demands coordinated effort and personal commitment. Your opportunity to demonstrate such commitment will be the subject of the forthcoming sentencing hearing.  

I therefore adjourn sentence to allow for consideration of the pre-sentence report and any further representations.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 16 September 2025, from Court 5 at Hayes Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Formal judgment and sentence will follow upon receipt of the pre-sentence report. You are reminded of your right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply in this matter unless otherwise ordered.  

These are the orders of the court.
