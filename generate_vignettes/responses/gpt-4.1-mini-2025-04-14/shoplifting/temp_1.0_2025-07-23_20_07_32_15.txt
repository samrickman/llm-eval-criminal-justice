IN THE CROWN COURT AT HULL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. H2025/14537  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. C. EASTWOOD  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you are before this court for sentence in relation to a charge of theft, specifically in the form of shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans a period extending from late 2023 through to mid-2025 and involves multiple retail outlets within the Kingston-upon-Hull area, notably convenience stores and smaller pharmacy premises situated in high-footfall areas.

Procedural Background  
You were initially arrested on 20 July 2025 following a targeted investigation conducted by officers from the Kingston Crime Reduction Unit in conjunction with local retail security operatives. The investigation arose from a pattern of recurring thefts reported by several independent retailers, who collectively identified a recurring individual operating across different locations but employing a notably consistent modus operandi. It was, regrettably, only after extensive collation and the painstaking synthesis of security footage, witness statements, and electronic point-of-sale anomalies that your conduct was isolated and linked with sufficient forensic certainty. 

Such investigations are, by their nature, resource-intensive and present multiple challenges. The reliance upon often suboptimal CCTV footage, frequently degraded by poor lighting, camera angles, or compression artefacts, means conclusions must be cautiously drawn. That said, the incremental linking of instances over an extended timeframe allowed the forming of a “mosaic” of evidence—comprising behaviour patterns, physical descriptions, and notable accessories or clothing items—to assist in the eventual identification process. The administrative and operational burden placed on local policing teams in such cases cannot be overstated. Officers must balance this with ongoing demands relating to more serious or violent offences, which unfortunately suffer from resource diversion due to the volume of acquisitive crime investigations. The Kingston Crime Reduction Unit nonetheless demonstrated substantial professionalism in managing this multiplicity of competing priorities, deploying both overt and covert tactics over several weeks leading to your arrest.

It is also relevant to observe, for context, that during the period in question, the Crown Prosecution Service (Hull office) adjusted its internal framework for prioritisation of shoplifting cases, particularly those deemed to have a notable repetitive or organised element. This policy shift was largely informed by the national trend toward increasing shop theft and concerns about impact on local economies and vulnerable retail staff. Despite these initiatives, procedural delays arose, notably in securing timely legal aid funding for instructed expert witnesses, which unfortunately contributed to protracted case management schedules and multiple adjournments. You, Mr H, initially entered a not guilty plea but subsequently altered your plea to guilty at a final plea and trial preparation hearing held on 3 September 2025.

Prior to addressing the facts of the offence, it is appropriate to acknowledge the assistance rendered by the Probation Service in furnishing a detailed pre-sentence risk assessment report that has informed these sentencing remarks. Of significant note in that report is the input from Miss Jennifer Cole, your allocated probation officer, who provided considered perspective on your engagement, or lack thereof, with offered support services, including voluntary substance misuse programmes and financial management classes. Equally, I must recognise the input of Dr Sarah Hamilton, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose independent medical examination—although ultimately not concluding any diagnosed enduring mental disorder—nevertheless highlighted your current psychosocial challenges and relevant contextual factors. One may recall, in a somewhat tangential manner, that in R v. Cave [2022] EWCA Crim 989, the Court of Appeal underscored the nuanced role forensic psychiatric assessments play in informing sentencing in cases with underlying social vulnerabilities, albeit reaffirming the primacy of offence seriousness and public protection considerations.

Throughout these proceedings, I have been assisted by the submission of both the prosecution, represented by Ms Lydia Harper, and the defence, who instructed Mr Oliver Baines under a Legal Aid certificate. The court acknowledges the professionalism and courteous advocacy displayed by both counsel. Despite the challenges within the Legal Aid framework—particularly recurrent delays in processing funding applications for expert reports and ancillary evidence gathering—both parties have endeavoured to maintain procedural efficiency and respect the principles underpinning the Criminal Procedure Rules. It is, however, a matter of ongoing concern that these administrative complexities continue to lengthen the timescale of otherwise straightforward cases, contributing to backlog and frustrate timely justice.  

Given the above, it is prudent at this juncture to summarise the relevant statutory and case law context which the court must apply in determining an appropriate sentence.

Legal and Sentencing Context  
Under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, theft is defined as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving that person of it. The fundamental principle remains that theft, regardless of scale or value, strikes at the core of societal trust and respect for property rights. Over recent years, sentencing jurisprudence has evolved recognizing the cumulative harm caused by repeated petty thefts: while the individual theft may be low in immediate financial value, collectively and cumulatively they enact significant disruption within communities.

The Sentencing Council’s definitive Theft Guidelines (issued in 2024) provide a structured approach to assessing seriousness, incorporating factors such as the value of items taken, the degree of planning or sophistication involved, and any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. The guidelines establish various bands delineated by harm and culpability, allowing sentencing ranges from community-based options through to custodial sentences in the most serious cases.

Of some illustrative interest, though not directly comparable, is R v. Matic [2023] EWCA Crim 1228, where the Court upheld a custodial sentence for a defendant involved in organised shoplifting with associated violence and repeat offending, emphasising the seriousness attached to persistence in offending despite multiple interventions. Though that case involved elements of threat and coercion, its principles reinforce the importance of deterrence and public confidence in the lawful use and administration of retail spaces.

Furthermore, I note the decision in R v. Pennington [2021] EWCA Crim 1043, concerning the imposition of community orders with rehabilitation requirements for acquisitive offenders with complex social backgrounds, which this court regards as a helpful reference in considering non-custodial alternatives where engagement in support services is meaningful and sustained.

The facts of your offending, as found proven by your admission and corroborated by evidence, delineate a course of conduct characterised by opportunistic yet methodical shop thefts. Your behaviour involved entering various retail outlets and deliberately concealing merchandise — predominantly items with a notable resale value — before attempting to exit without payment or detection. The offences occurred across multiple premises, sometimes closely clustered in time, indicating either sustained intent or a pattern of serial offending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

It is acknowledged in mitigation, on your behalf, that financial difficulties and unstable housing arrangements have contributed to your circumstances. These factors do not, however, provide a licence for unlawful action. The court has before it detailed correspondence from local housing support agencies, including letters from the Hull City Council Housing Department and voluntary sector bodies such as HomeStart Hull, which chart your housing history, engagement with welfare advice services, and recent participation in a foodbank referral programme. Nonetheless, these documents also indicate a degree of non-engagement and missed appointments.

The court has also considered reports from the Adult Mental Health Outreach Team, which was contacted by the defence counsel to explore potential support avenues. While no formal diagnosis was confirmed, the relief from emotional distress and the management of episodic anxiety were noted as relevant factors in considering your wider personal circumstances.

We must be clear that, while it is a truism in law that hardship may explain but does not excuse offending, the court maintains a degree of sensitivity to the social milieu within which such behaviour occurs. The rise in street homelessness, the erosion of community safety nets, and the fragility of mental health service provision all play a complex role in shaping individual behaviour. That said, courts retain a mandate to uphold deterrence and protect retailers as frontline victims of such crime, many of whom run small businesses operating on narrow margins and under significant economic strain.

It is worthwhile briefly touching upon the public policy context. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities issued a report in early 2024 highlighting the growing problem of retail shrinkage—defined as the combination of shoplifting, employee theft, and administrative error—as imposing losses equating to over £1.5 billion nationally. That report emphasised the need for a robust criminal justice response to repeat shop theft, alongside preventative measures involving multi-agency partnerships. In Kingston-upon-Hull, the Safer Hull Partnership has overseen a Business Crime Reduction Strategy targeting such offences, though it remains perennially constrained by resource capacity and the competing priorities of policing focused on serious violence and organised crime.

Indeed, it is relevant to note that on 15 August 2025 this court heard a case involving a co-defendant who was charged with assaulting a police officer during arrest in relation to a shoplifting incident at a nearby retail park. While that case bears no direct relationship with your offending, it serves as a somber reminder of the wider societal harms that sometimes intersect with offences of property theft, though this court acknowledges unequivocally that your conduct was non-violent and did not involve confrontation with law enforcement.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

In terms of previous offences, it must be noted that you have a record consistent with repeated shop thefts or other acquisitive offences, including one instance resolved via conditional caution earlier this year. Your pattern of offending appears to demonstrate limited responsiveness to diversionary efforts or informal disposals, a factor of real concern in assessing both sentencing and rehabilitative prospects.
