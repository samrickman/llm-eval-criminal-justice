IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/13642  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. H. LINDERS  
Filed: 16 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today following your conviction on a charge concerning shoplifting offences, alleged to have occurred between late 2023 and early 2025 across multiple retail establishments within the Greater Manchester area. The court is required now to impose sentence having regard to the statutory framework, the sentencing guidelines applicable to theft, and the particular circumstances of this case.

Procedural History  
Your initial arrest took place on 12 March 2025 — following a sustained investigation conducted by officers from the Manchester Central Retail Crime Unit in conjunction with the Greater Manchester Police Street Crime Team. This investigation was initiated after a marked increase in complaints from local shopkeepers and retail chains operating throughout the city centre and adjacent suburban districts. These complaints referenced a persistent pattern of thefts, sometimes involving repeat visits from the same individual, characterised by a methodical approach to concealment of goods.

The manifold difficulties presented by the collation and verification of video evidence in such cases are well recognised. Despite the common presumption that modern CCTV networks offer an almost infallible means of prevention and detection, realities in the field confound such assumptions. The quality of footage, its continuity, and the clarity of identifying features are frequently compromised by obstructions, inadequate lighting, and data storage limitations. Substantial police and prosecution time is expended in reviewing and cross-examining this material—a process that is neither swift nor straightforward. Indeed, notwithstanding significant investment in digital forensics units, the extraction of useable evidence remains a resource-intensive endeavour. 

The case was initially listed before the Magistrates' Court but was swiftly committed for trial at the Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) procedures instituted to streamline the treatment of such matters. The prompt listing and allocation to this court for plea and preparatory hearings are noted with approval as being in keeping with the principles of proportionality and expedition embraced by the Criminal Procedure Rules.

An ancillary consideration affecting the timetable related to the defendant’s Legal Aid application for funding the instruction of an independent forensic psychologist. Unfortunately, procedural delays ensued, which are regrettably increasingly common in cases requiring expert assessments. This has imposed an unwelcome burden on procedural scheduling, as well as on counsel and court personnel alike.

The initial plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 25 May 2025. At that hearing you entered a not guilty plea, necessitating the preparation of the case for trial. However, following the service of additional evidence and a detailed pre-sentence psychiatric assessment, you tendered a guilty plea on the day of trial opening on 13 August 2025. I must observe—dispassionately but firmly—that late pleas of this nature, while within your rights, attract significantly less credit under the present sentencing regime than early acceptance of responsibility and co-operation with the criminal justice process. This position is underscored in numerous appellate authorities, notably R v. Walsh [2019] EWCA Crim 1142 and more recently R v. Parker [2023] EWCA Crim 879.

I acknowledge with gratitude the participation of Ms Lucy Brent, appearing on behalf of the Crown, and Mr Stephen Morris representing the defence under Legal Aid certification. I also record my concern about the persistent delays in Legal Aid’s processing of applications for expert reports, which appear to hamper the timely resolution of cases—a situation not unique to this jurisdiction.

On the wider jurisprudential plane, this court notes that theft offences, including shoplifting, fall squarely within the parameters established by section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. Whilst often perceived as less serious than violent offences, they nevertheless carry a distinct public harm dimension, particularly when committed as part of a sustained or escalating pattern. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, promulgated in 2021, emphasises that persistence, planning, and the resultant impact on vulnerable victims are significant factors in the exercise of judicial discretion.

There is pertinent appellate authority which this court references for completeness. In R v. Empson [2017] EWCA Crim 1774, the Court of Appeal made clear the importance of tailoring sentences to reflect not only the value of stolen goods but also the disruption to business operations, and the psychological impact on staff repeatedly subject to theft or its threat. Similarly, R v. Millington [2020] EWCA Crim 2029 reiterated that while shoplifting may be non-violent, it undermines the fabric of commercial trust and imposes costs on both individual businesses and the broader community.

An examination of recent trends in acquisitive crime further informs the court’s contextual understanding. The Business Crime Forum, in its April 2025 report, remarked on the increasing sophistication exhibited by some offenders, including the use of distraction techniques, altering appearance between offences, and exploiting vulnerabilities in self-service and unmanned retail environments. While the present case does not involve all such factors, it is nevertheless situated within this pattern.

The facts of this case are as follows:

It bears mentioning that during the course of the investigation, co-defendant actors involved in a separate incident were apprehended and charged with offences of affray and possession of offensive weapons during disturbances linked tangentially to retail security enforcement. These matters, while serious, have no bearing on your individual culpability and are proceeding under separate case management.

A salient feature of the case has been the impact on retail employees, many of whom have reported increased anxiety and manifest reluctance to work alone or during certain shifts. These effects, though subjective, are corroborated by written testimony submitted by the Worker Retail Union. Their accounts describe a climate of fear and apprehension occasioned by visible theft patterns, leading to staff turnover and altered employment practices. These ripple effects highlight the broader societal implications that extend beyond the loss of goods themselves.

Furthermore, correspondence submitted by the Northeast Retailers Association elucidates the logistical and financial consequences of persistent shoplifting on small and medium enterprises. Reduced margins compel some stores to implement additional security measures, raising overhead costs and potentially impacting customer experience.

It is worth acknowledging that the prolonged strain placed upon NHS mental health services, particularly adult community mental health teams, is well documented in official reports. A 2024 Department of Health and Social Care briefing noted waiting times for assessment often exceeding six months in urban areas, compounded by funding shortfalls and staffing deficits. The resultant bottlenecks may limit access for individuals with complex needs, especially those with co-morbid substance misuse issues. These factors contextualise but do not excuse any failure to engage in available therapeutic supports.

In similar vein, Probation Service capacity continues under strain. The 2025 Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation (HMIP) Annual Report highlights a systemic under-resourcing of offender management teams, restricting the scope for tailored interventions and supervision. Probation officers engaged in this case have noted significant caseload volumes, limiting regular contact.

The pre-sentence psychiatric report, compiled by Dr Fiona Elstob, consultant forensic psychiatrist, offers critical insights. Dr Elstob’s assessment, undertaken over several sessions including psychological testing and collateral interviews, concludes you do not suffer from any recognized major mental disorder. Nevertheless, traits of low impulse control and elements of mild depressive symptomatology were identified, alongside episodic misuse of non-prescribed benzodiazepines. There is, however, scant evidence of frank substance dependence or psychosis. The report qualifies that while these factors do not negate responsibility, they ought to inform the design of any rehabilitative programme.

I take this opportunity to commend the efforts of the Manchester Shopkeepers’ Support Charity, who have provided relentless assistance to affected store employees. Their mediation work and practical support—despite operating under severe resource restrictions—embodies a community-responsive approach to the harms occasioned by acquisitive offending.

The sentencing guideline directs the court’s attention to matters of culpability and harm. As you have no relevant convictions beyond isolated minor offences, you are to be regarded as a low-tariff offender for these purposes. But the protracted character of your offending, repeated breaches of informal resolutions, and failure to desist despite prior warnings, raise the seriousness level.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

Given the evidence, it is clear there was a pattern of deliberate behaviour involving concealment of goods, some use of social engineering tactics as well as return visits to targeted premises despite prior intervention.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

The prosecution’s submissions correctly highlight that whilst the overall financial value of stolen items remained below the threshold for indictable offence in isolation, the aggregate loss and cumulative societal impact necessitate a sentence calibrated to reflect both individual culpability and public protection.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

I am mindful that there are no allegations of violence, threats, or intimidation, and that no co-offending in your name has been substantiated. However, I note with concern the failure to engage meaningfully with support services, despite repeated offers facilitated by both probation and community liaison officers.

In matters of sentencing law, the principles articulated in R v. Toms [2018] EWCA Crim 1222 reinforce proportionality balanced with deterrence. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal in R v. Corrigan [2022] EWCA Crim 1509 recently underscored that repeat low-level offending which systematically undermines small businesses may justify custodial sanctions despite overall low financial loss.

Equally, the importance of a structured rehabilitative approach is paramount. The probation service is, therefore, requested in their pre-sentence investigation to consider the possibility of addressing underlying impulsivity and situational triggers, alongside practical support in engagement with employment and housing services.

At this juncture, the court declines to make a definitive finding concerning custodial versus community sentencing options; such decisions are best informed upon receipt of the detailed pre-sentence report. This report should include assessments of risk, personal circumstances, and any recommendations as to appropriate programme requirements — including cognitive skills and financial management courses, which are often pivotal in reducing reoffending risk.

I record appreciation to all professionals involved, including Ms Samantha Yates and the Probation Service staff who have provided liaison and written observations. Their input is invaluable in shaping the court’s approach.

In issuing these sentencing remarks, I reiterate the court’s awareness of the broader challenges facing the criminal justice and social care systems: recruitment shortages, funding constraints, and capacity issues bedevil many agencies tasked with prevention and rehabilitation. These systemic issues, while significant, do not diminish individual responsibility or the need for accountability.

The present hearing was conducted in open court, with counsel appearing as noted. The court acknowledges but does not diminish the impact of your guilty plea, late though it was entered, and the sincerity of any remorse expressed. That being said, the law is clear that such pleas attract lesser discounts when tendered in these circumstances.

These sentencing remarks are promulgated this day, 16 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. Proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is hereby informed of the right to appeal the sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, section 108, and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
