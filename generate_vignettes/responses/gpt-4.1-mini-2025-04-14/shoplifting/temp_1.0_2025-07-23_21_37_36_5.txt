IN THE CROWN COURT AT BELMONT  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/14837  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. A. Penrose  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before the court today to be sentenced following your conviction on a representative charge of theft, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising from allegations of shoplifting offences committed over an extended period in various retail establishments within the Belmont and Heathcote jurisdictions. This sentencing hearing forms the culmination of proceedings that have traversed multiple hearings over the course of the past eight months, inclusive of pre-trial and evidential applications, with attendant procedural considerations worthy of brief reflection before I turn to the substantive matter of sentencing itself.

Procedural History and Case Progression  
This case was initially listed at the Belmont Magistrates’ Court on 12 January 2025. The nature of the charges and the anticipated complexity necessitated early transfer to the Crown Court for trial under the Better Case Management (BCM) regime. The BCM process, established in 2005, was designed to mitigate delay, improve the management of trials, and provide clarity in complex or multi-faceted matters. I note that, although the principles of BCM were invoked, the case experienced several adjournments owing to limited availability of defence funding and the delayed submission of forensic reports. Specifically, the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted processing of applications for expert assessments drew an unfortunate but all too familiar strain on the court’s scheduling. The delays resulted in listing modifications from the originally intended June trial window to August, with sentence not scheduled until today.

During the pre-trial hearings, the Crown made a detailed opening, specifying a series of incidents over which you were suspected to have engaged in a sustained campaign of thefts from several retail outlets. The prosecution was assisted by evidence including extensive CCTV footage, statements from retail personnel, and forensic linkage analysis. The defence initially maintained pleas of not guilty, invoking challenges around identification and procedural fairness, but ultimately a change of plea to guilty was entered prior to the commencement of the trial proper.

It is worth acknowledging the efforts of the prosecution barrister, Ms Emma Lane, for her diligent preparation and advocacy, and of Mr Stuart Fenwick, instructed on your behalf under a representation order granted through Legal Aid, who has nonetheless contended with the systemic obstacles engendered by funding delays and third-party expert availability.

By way of procedural note, the hearing room itself has undergone recent refurbishment funded by the Justice Facilities Board, resulting in improved accessibility and technological capability, which has facilitated the smoother conduct of this and other hearings. Indeed, I commend the court staff and usher team for the maintenance of order and decorum throughout the proceedings, notwithstanding the challenges of scheduling and occasional late arrival of interpreters in unrelated matters on the same listing.

To situate this case in broader context, several reports and statements were submitted from entities wholly unconnected with your personal conduct but highly relevant to the environment in which the offences occurred. The Belmont Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BBCRP) issued a comprehensive briefing outlining the cumulative impact of shoplifting in the area, highlighting a 13% increase in incidents over the past fiscal year, and drawing attention to supply chain disruptions. While these statistics are indisputably material to local policing strategy, they bear only indirect relevance to your individual culpability or risk profile.

Moreover, letters from the Belmont Small Business Association provided reflections on the strain placed on retail workers, many of whom have suffered emotional distress resulting from repeat offending. Similarly, correspondence from the Belmont Shop Staff Welfare Trust described ongoing efforts to provide psychological support to front-line employees, some of whom raised concerns about perceived inadequacies in workplace protection.

These materials, offered in the spirit of victim care and informed public safety policy, assist the court in appreciating the broader implications of acquisitive crime but must be carefully calibrated against the particulars of your involvement.

Submissions were made concerning previous cases that, while not factually analogous, nevertheless provide a jurisprudential framework for sentencing considerations in theft and related offences. Notably:

In R v. Carlisle [2019] EWCA Crim 1418, the Court of Appeal affirmed the approach to sentencing in cases involving multiple low-value thefts occurring in a compressed timeframe. The appellant’s offending, involving repeated entry into a supermarket to remove household goods without payment, was adjudged to merit immediate custody commensurate with the cumulative impact on the business and community confidence. That decision underscores the court’s recognition that persistence and planning in theft offences materially aggravate culpability, even when individual items may be of low value.

In R v. Brooks [2023] EWCA Crim 646, the Court considered the aggravating effect of offences committed within close proximity to vulnerable populations, such as care homes or youth centres. Although your offending took place in primarily commercial areas, one of the premises targeted dealt extensively with elderly customers, which the court deems worthy of consideration in sentencing.

A notable case, R v. Hemsworth [2020] EWCA Crim 1724, concerned burglary of a private dwelling during the defendant’s absence on holiday. Though not germane directly to the instant proceedings, Hemsworth’s recognition of personal violation as an aggravating factor informs the court’s understanding of the psychological impact of intrusion offences vis-à-vis theft.

Furthermore, in R v. Penfold [2018] EWCA Crim 1397, the Court upheld a custodial sentence for offences of fly-tipping that caused environmental degradation. While such cases lie outside the realm of acquisitive crime, Penfold illustrates the sentencing court’s discretion in considering harm beyond mere financial loss.

I note also the recent case of R v. Dempsey [2025] EWHC 2345 (Admin), concerning procedural delays attributed to staffing shortages in the Probation Service, a factor arguably relevant today given ongoing community supervision challenges.

In addition to these precedents, I must mention a recent significant decision with potential tangential relevance to sentencing in cases involving mental health considerations — R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624. Though the offending in that matter involved arson and serious psychiatric diagnoses, the court’s articulation of the balance between therapeutic intervention and public protection remains instructive, especially where psychiatric vulnerability is proffered as mitigation.

The Clinical and Probation Reports  
In the interests of a comprehensive approach to sentencing, detailed reports prepared by Dr Helena Fawcett, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, and Mr David Britton, Probation Officer, were submitted and reviewed in advance of today’s hearing.

Dr Fawcett’s report offers a careful evaluation based on clinical interviews and collateral history. She finds no conclusive evidence of severe mental illness, but notes traits consistent with impulsivity, mood dysregulation, and low motivational drive. She references a history of substance misuse of a mild nature, predominantly alcohol, but no current dependency. Treatment engagement has been sporadic. The report cautiously recommends consideration of community-based interventions that might address underlying psychosocial stressors but stops short of advocating for custodial measures solely on psychiatric grounds.

Mr Britton’s probation assessment paints a more nuanced portrait of your social circumstances: variable accommodation status, limited familial support, and documented unemployment over recent years. His commentary reflects substantial concern regarding the risk of reoffending and recognizes a pattern of “entrenched acquisitive offending” absent significant engagement with support or rehabilitation pathways.

The Pre-Sentence Report further explores the limitations imposed by systemic pressures. The Probation Service in Belmont remains under intense operational strain. Caseloads are at an unprecedented high, with vacancy rates exacerbating risk assessment and intervention effectiveness. Such factors are determinative in deciding the practicability of supervision and compliance monitoring.

A letter from the Belmont Community Liaison Worker, Mrs Ellen Hawthorne, expresses the frontline challenges of supporting individuals with “complex, overlapping vulnerabilities” in a resource-limited environment. Her submission underscores the delicate balance between enforcement and assistance that characterizes modern probation practice.

It is pertinent to mention that the probation officer assigned to oversee your potential community order has been temporarily suspended pending internal investigation unrelated to your case, highlighting yet another dimension of institutional challenge that inevitably affects the quality and continuity of supervision available.

An outline of various local multi-agency meetings—MARAC (Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference) and MAPPA (Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements)—is provided in the Probation Report, though you have no history of serious violent or sexual offending warranting MAPPA review. The bedside manner of these cross-departmental protocols illustrates the increasing bureaucratic complexity of public protection frameworks and the extensive coordination needed to manage offenders.

The Impact on Victims and the Community  
Statements from staff at affected retail outlets were received, providing insight into the direct effects of your offending. While none allege physical injury or threat, the emotional toll on workers is palpable. Several described heightened anxiety, reluctance to work alone, and the imposition of increased security measures that have disrupted normal business operations.

In particular, a letter from Ms Carol Lent, a senior shop assistant at Heathcote Supermarket, recounts how a colleague developed post-incident stress symptoms following repeated encounters with a person resembling the defendant. The anxiety extended beyond the immediate workplace and into wider community settings.

Notably, the Belmont Shopkeepers’ Federation submitted a position paper outlining the cumulative financial losses attributed to shoplifting over the previous year, estimating £450,000 in direct losses and indirect costs related to security enhancements and staffing adjustments. These figures, while general in nature, underscore the broader societal impact of persistent retail crime.

While the court takes a somber view of these effects, it remains the province of sentencing to weigh these interests alongside the proportionality of response to the individual’s culpability and prospects for rehabilitation.

The Offending Conduct: Details and Patterns  
A detailed chronology compiled by the prosecution lays out the modus operandi of the offending, indicating an opportunistic but consistently repeated approach within a circumscribed geographic range. The surveillance material shows a pattern of entering premises during peak rush and shift-change times, exploiting moments of employee distraction or absence.

It is frequent in such cases that defendants attempt to minimise the degree of planning or intent involved, suggesting impulsive or necessity-driven actions. However, the evidence here suggests calculated behaviour: use of concealed bags, staged distractions, and, on occasion, the removing of security tags with improvised tools.

The court has also been furnished with incident reports from the Criminal Evidence and Intelligence Bureau (CEIB), highlighting an administrative increase in reported retail thefts in Belmont East following the relevant period. While that trend provides backdrop, it must not unduly colour the assessment of your individual conduct.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Pressing contextual challenges must be acknowledged. The shops in question, while not high-end, constitute vital sources of essential goods for the surrounding populations. The repeated interference with their operations produces ripples that affect not only proprietors but also consumers reliant on their services. This human and economic dimension cannot be disregarded.

Nonetheless, this court is mindful to maintain distinction between the macro and the micro, ensuring that sentencing adheres to principles of individual justice.

Prior Interventions and Rehabilitation Prospects  
You have, over the years, encountered varying degrees of intervention relating to your offending. Records reflect at least two previous community resolutions, a fine imposed in 2021 for a similar low-level theft, and a conditional discharge from 2023. Despite these measures, no identifiable trajectory of desistment is evident.

It remains a familiar and regrettable narrative: successive opportunities for engagement with supportive services declined or ignored. The reasons for this are complex and, at times, opaque; mental health concerns, social isolation, and economic hardship are frequent companions to repeated acquisitive offending. Yet the pattern of relentlessness suggests an insufficient recognition of consequences.

The court has reviewed various diversion schemes available in Belmont, including the Shoplifting Intervention Programme and community mentoring initiatives. It is of note that you neither completed nor engaged meaningfully with these schemes.

A letter from the East Belmont Housing Outreach Team remarks upon your precarious accommodation history, highlighting risk of homelessness but also noting a consistent failure to attend scheduled appointments or respond to support outreach initiatives.

A recent submission from the Belmont Substance Support Service confirms occasional attendance at advice sessions but no sustained contact, reflecting the broader theme of limited utilization of available aid.

Sentencing Framework and Considerations  
The theft offences must be approached in light of the Sentencing Council’s definitive guidelines on theft. Factors such as the value of goods stolen, persistence and premeditation, victim impact, previous convictions, and the presence or absence of remorse all bear upon appropriate sentence range and type.

Please be clear, Mr H, that demonstrable persistence and deliberate conduct will normally attract greater severity than isolated, spontaneous acts.

In addition, the court must weigh your personal circumstances, including vulnerability and any mitigating features. Mitigation was advanced on your behalf in the form of a letter from your sister, Ms Bernadine H., which this court has read and considered. Her testimony speaks to a difficult family history, periods of instability in your early years, and current struggles with housing and employment. While these factors provide context, they are not conclusive reasons for leniency where conduct shows continued defiance of law and order.

Theoretical considerations also come into play. Reference may be made, albeit loosely, to R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412, concerning the delicate balance between clinical intervention and public protection in cases marked by episodic mental health relapse and escalating anti-social behaviour. Though distinctly different in facts, Bhandari illustrates the contemporary shift in sentencing towards integrative solutions over retributive alone.

As the court notes, Legal Aid authorisations for such reports have become subject to procedural complexity and delay, as seen in this case, which inevitably constrains timely and holistic sentencing.

Finally, it is relevant to mention that simultaneous proceedings against a co-defendant involved allegations of assaulting arresting officers with the use of a chair — an incident entirely unrelated to your conduct — which have had no bearing on the present case but served to complicate resource allocation within the listing.

Conclusion and Next Steps  
In closing, Mr H, these proceedings epitomize many of the systemic tensions inherent in dealing with repeat low-level acquisitive offending. The offence itself, while not violent or carrying the immediate threat of serious harm, nonetheless contributes to an incremental diminution of public confidence and retail safety, impacts vulnerable workers, and draws significant public service resources.

This court remains mindful of the value of structured community measures where appropriate. However, the measured persistence, lack of meaningful engagement with assistance, and repeated breaches of social contract evident here suggest that a custodial element cannot be discounted lightly.

I will direct that an up-to-date pre-sentence report be prepared forthwith, encompassing consideration of both custodial and community options, as well as any proposes rehabilitation or intervention measures that could be realistically sustained post-sentencing.
