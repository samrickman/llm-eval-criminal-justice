IN THE CROWN COURT AT TOWCESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/20281  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. CHARLESWORTH  
Filed: 14 August 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in relation to offences of theft by shoplifting, committed over a period spanning several months within the Towcester and surrounding Northamptonshire boroughs. The charges arise under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, reflecting a course of conduct the prosecution submits was deliberate, recurrent, and demonstrative of a pattern of dishonesty.  

Procedural Background  
You were initially arrested on 12 May 2025, following an investigation led by officers from the Northamptonshire Constabulary’s Retail Crime Unit in conjunction with local Business Crime Reduction Partnership coordinators. The inception of the inquiry was prompted by an aggregation of informal reports from small business owners within Towcester town centre and the neighbouring district of Brackley. Yesterday, I had cause to reflect on how the local authority’s allocation of resources toward policing acquisitive crime has increasingly become a subject of operational and political debate. The continuing pressures presented by rising case volumes strain the capacity of policing divisions, which must reconcile priorities between acquisitive offending, violent crime, and public order disturbances. Legislative reforms to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 — although beyond this court’s remit — have indirectly influenced investigatory tactics and evidential gathering practices in such cases.  

This matter’s procedural history includes a first hearing at Northampton Magistrates’ Court on 19 May 2025, followed by transfer to this Crown Court following the defendant’s election to be tried on indictment. The case was listed for a plea and case management hearing (PCMH) on 9 July 2025, where you entered a not guilty plea. The matter was set down for trial but was ultimately disposed of following your guilty pleas entered on 28 July 2025 at the opening of the trial window.  

As your legal representatives noted, the late plea reduced trial length and spared witnesses from the ordeal of giving evidence under cross-examination. The principle of credit for an early guilty plea is well established — as articulated in R v. Hunter [2023] EWCA Crim 2121 — which is to incentivise timely admissions of guilt, facilitate fair sentencing, and conserve judicial resources. The court is mindful, as stated by Lord Justice Singh, that “remorse and early acceptance of responsibility no longer carry the presumptive maximum reduction where plea timings suggest tactical pleadings.” Thus, in your case, credit will be moderated accordingly.  

It is regrettable to report that notwithstanding the efforts of all parties to progress this matter efficiently under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, procedural delays were occasioned by the complexity of securing Legal Aid funding for independent expert reports. The application submitted by Mr Pryce, defence counsel, on 17 June 2025 to instruct Dr Paul Edmondson, a forensic psychologist specialising in acquisitive offenders with histories of impulsive behaviour patterns, was only approved on 24 July 2025 after multiple interlocutory exchanges with the Legal Aid Agency. Such delays are a systemic hindrance to timely justice and continue to occasion concern.

The court acknowledges the notable challenge faced by overstretched local authorities tasked with safeguarding retail workers, many of whom undertake these responsibilities with limited formal training and amidst concerns about their personal safety. This societal context frames but does not excuse the offending.  

It is worth recording that in the intervening years since the inception of the Theft Act in 1968, the prosecution of retail theft offences has evolved with technological advancements, including the widespread adoption of electronic article surveillance systems, biometric identification, and real-time data sharing among law enforcement and retail security teams. Nevertheless, the court observes that the fundamental challenge remains: balancing community expectations of courteous, convenient shopping environments with the imperative to deter and punish dishonesty.

You will be aware that the Criminal Justice System continues to grapple with the complexity posed by non-violent economic crime. This difficulty is compounded by shifting societal attitudes towards shoplifting offences, some of which have unfortunately come to be seen in certain quarters as lesser or excusable, particularly where purported economic disenfranchisement is invoked. The court is not unsympathetic to personal hardship, but such hardship does not confer license to commit crime.  

The involvement of local agencies such as the Towcester Community Safety Partnership and the adjoining Northamptonshire Shopwatch Scheme has been instrumental in collating incident reports and facilitating the sharing of intelligence. The latter maintains a central role by convening monthly intelligence briefings attended by policing and local authority officers. That forum has been critical in identifying repeat offenders and ensuring an integrated response to retail crime. Yet, despite these efforts, the court is acutely conscious of the fragile state of community policing. Foot patrols have diminished, and the shift towards Incident Response Units, whilst necessary, imposes a reactive rather than proactive posture.  

Your defence team sought to deploy an expert report from Dr Edmondson, who provided detailed analysis of your psychological profile, noting the absence of major mental illness but identifying traits indicative of impulsivity and some degree of substance misuse, particularly alcohol dependence. The psychiatric and psychological evaluation, commissioned pursuant to paragraph 6D of the Sentencing Council’s guideline on Theft Offences, spoke to underlying vulnerabilities rather than excusing conduct.

In examining relevant legal precedents, the court has had occasion to review the principles laid down in R v. Darbyshire [2019] EWCA Crim 1236, in which the Court of Appeal emphasised that custodial sentences for theft offences must be proportionate to the value of stolen goods, the harm caused to victims, and the offender’s culpability. Darbyshire also endorsed the use of community orders featuring rehabilitative requirements where appropriate, highlighting the benefits of tailored interventions aimed at reducing reoffending.  

Also noted is R v. Nimmo [2020] EWCA Crim 2049, a case arising from agitation in the public transport network linked to fare evasion and repeated theft. There, the Court made clear that cumulative harm from persistent low-value thefts may meet the threshold for custody when the damage to public confidence and operational burden are considered alongside offender history. While your matter is distinguishable, the underlying principles remain germane.

Mr H, the psychological report provided a candid but balanced assessment. Dr Edmondson commented that while your disorder traits are striking, they do not equate with conditions that would incline the court towards a hospital order under the Mental Health Act 1983, nor do they render you unfit to plead or blameworthy. However, your report stresses the difficulties in terms of impulse control, diminished risk awareness, and inadequate engagement with support services.  

It is relevant to note, for the purposes of sentencing, that contending with substance dependency is beyond the remit of the criminal court but is a matter which probation services are often well-placed to address through referral to specialist providers. The Probation Service’s Presentence Report, which is pending, should consider this context comprehensively.  

During the preparation for trial, it emerged that Mr H’s sister, Ms Bernadine H, wrote a letter to the court expressing concern for her brother’s welfare and asserting that while he was not an aggressive or violent person, he struggles with maintaining accommodation and managing money. This letter was tendered alongside endorsements from the Towcester Outreach Centre and the Northamptonshire Substance Recovery Clinic, attesting to your intermittent contact with community support but noting frequent missed appointments.

The local authority housing department has reported an ongoing case load of approximately 320 persons currently facing housing insecurity in the Towcester area, many of whom, regrettably, fall outside the scope of statutory homelessness assistance. The pressures on housing stock and associated support services remain acute. While this background provides context, it cannot—and does not—diminish the seriousness with which this court regards dishonesty offences.  

Furthermore, the court has received victim statements from proprietors of small independent retail outlets who describe heightened anxiety among staff as a result of your offending. While no physical altercation occurred, the emotional and operational impact of repeated shoplifting events is increasingly acknowledged in the guidance published by the Retail Trust and the British Retail Consortium. Such victim personal statements carry weight and merit full consideration.

An added procedural consideration was the late absence of an interpreter, which regrettably occasioned a brief adjournment on 28 July. While generally, this court enjoys reliable access to interpreting services, the increasing linguistic diversity of the court’s defendant pool occasionally strains interpreter availability. That such issues are minor annoyances does not detract from the wider pressures on court staff, who strive to maintain the integrity and orderly conduct of proceedings despite resource limitations.  

The court has observed a trend in recent years towards increasing use of community sentences with elements such as unpaid work and rehabilitative activity requirements in cases involving acquisitive offences. This is consistent with the position articulated in the Sentencing Council’s guideline. However, in cases marked by persistence, an escalated degree of culpability, or multiple prior convictions, custodial sentences remain appropriate.

In R v. Merriman [2021] EWCA Crim 897, the appellant was found guilty of repeated dissemination and possession of indecent images after a forensic examination of his electronic devices. That case, involving serious offences against children, is clearly distinguishable from the present facts. Nevertheless, it underscores the principle that the nature of the offence
