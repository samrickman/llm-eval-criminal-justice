IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHWARK  
R v. MR H  
Case No. S2025/14327  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. A. G. Sterling  
Filed: 19 August 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence in relation to charges under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising from a series of offences of theft by shoplifting committed over an extended period in various retail establishments across the Southwark and surrounding boroughs. The indictment reflects a single representative count reflecting a course of conduct.

The procedural background to these proceedings is instructive as a frame for consideration. Your initial arrest occurred on 10 April 2025, following an extensive police investigation coordinated by the Southwark Safer Neighbourhood Team in partnership with retail security personnel and the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership. This multi-agency collaboration included use of anonymous tip-offs, surveillance operations, and CCTV collation across numerous store chains. The case progressed under the auspices of the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme, intended to enhance case efficiency and reduce delay through early evidence disclosure and active case supervision.

It is a regrettable but well-attested reality that acquisitive crimes, especially those involving shoplifting, consume disproportionate time and resources across the criminal justice system. Officers, often stretched across competing duties, dedicate hours to trawling through grainy and sometimes incomplete CCTV footage, coordinating with increasingly fatigued store staff who suffer unwarranted distraction and fear as a result of repeat offences. It must be noted that while the monetary value of goods taken at any one time may be low, the cumulative effect on business viability, staff wellbeing, and community confidence can be profound.

At an initial plea hearing held on 22 May 2025, you entered a not guilty plea. This necessitated further evidence gathering, including forensic examination of seized items, analysis of transactional data, and witness statements from retail workers affected by your conduct. Following a pre-trial review on 18 July 2025, and once the evidentiary landscape became unassailable, your plea was changed to guilty.

The timing of this change in plea accords with the well-established principle in sentencing law that earlier guilty pleas are discounted more favourably, reflecting the saving of public time and sparing of witnesses’ anxiety, as elaborated in cases such as R v. Levy [2018] EWCA Crim 2925, where the Court of Appeal confirmed that the utility of a plea lies chiefly in its timing and sincerity.

I must also observe, with evident concern, that whilst the Better Case Management framework is designed to streamline progression, that ideal is not always realised. In this case, although progression followed rules on paper, the court was made aware of delays arising from a legal aid authorisation dispute over expert reports, which issue I hope will soon receive systemic attention to prevent similar disruption in other cases.

The courts continue to grapple with the consequences of repeated acquisitive offending, much of which, in isolation by value, might be considered trivial. The cumulative and systemic impact is, however, anything but. The demand placed upon police and court resources, community safety partnerships, and victims themselves — the often unseen retail workers — is significant. Such offences tend to occur amidst a social backdrop characterised by economic inequality, housing insecurity, and an ever-present risk of substance misuse and mental health strain. It is not the province of the court to engage in social policy analysis, yet awareness of wider societal factors remains relevant in shaping a just response.

In this connection, I acknowledge with gratitude the evidence submitted by the local voluntary sector. The Southwark Retail Support Initiative, staffed by dedicated volunteers and sparse paid professionals, provided letters attesting to the disruption caused—not merely in terms of theft loss but also rising staff anxiety and turnover. The letters were provided in a tone measured and professional, reflecting restraint in not seeking to maximise damage claims, but nonetheless outlining a clear impact on local businesses.

Before expanding on the particulars of the offending conduct, I deem it appropriate to acknowledge the broader jurisprudential context against which this matter unfolds. The Theft Act 1968 remains the foundational statutory instrument governing offences of this nature; however, fine nuances have evolved through case law which continue to inform the court’s approach to proportionality, culpability, and sentencing range.

A seminal ruling remains R v. Fenech [2010] EWCA Crim 2227, where the Court of Appeal delineated key aggravating factors in theft offences, emphasizing premeditation, exploitation of position, and breach of public trust as elements warranting elevated custodial disposition. While that authority concerns white-collar theft, its principles instruct the sentencing approach for repeated, organised offending, including those within retail contexts.

The principle that mitigation may be accorded for genuine remorse and early admission is well-established, although as set out in R v. Macallister [2015] EWCA Crim 1457, the plausibility and timing of such commitments are key. A belated plea after compendious investigation and evidence compilation may attract reduced credit or none at all.

Also relevant, although not a strict precedent here, is the decision in R v. Beaumont [2019] EWCA Crim 834 relating to persistent acquisitive offenders who fail to engage with intervention programmes, where the court indicated that repeated failure to desist despite community-based disposals justified custodial consideration.

Turning to considerations of your personal circumstances, the court has had the benefit of a psychiatric assessment conducted by Dr. Hannah Lewis, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose report dated 8 August 2025, offers a comprehensive evaluation of your mental state, cognitive functioning, and potential contributory factors.

Dr. Lewis notes that while you do not meet criteria for major psychiatric illness, there is evidence of elevated impulsivity and signs consistent with oppositional-defiant personality traits. She notes a history of inconsistent engagement with past support services, and a pattern of polysubstance use, which may compound behavioural dysregulation.

The report includes observations that you manifest periods of relative stability interspersed with episodes of disorganised decision-making, but importantly, Dr. Lewis found no indication that your actions occurred in the context of psychosis or diminished responsibility. Her conclusion is that while clinical intervention can be beneficial in reducing risk, it is not determinative of culpability in respect of your conduct before the court.

It is also pertinent to note the probation service assessment submitted on 12 August 2025, prepared by Ms. Elaine Robertson, which provides a detailed account of your personal, familial, social, and economic circumstances. The report chronicles a history of transience in housing, periods of unemployment, and intermittent family contact, with an absence of stable employment or educational engagement since your late teens.

Ms. Robertson notes your expressed willingness to engage with rehabilitative programmes, emphasizing cognitive-behavioural approaches to address impulsivity and accommodation of relevant support for substance use where necessary. The risk of reoffending is assessed at medium, with deficits in motivation and insight identified as key areas for intervention.

This probation report is circumspect in its recommendations, suggesting that a combination of community-based sentence with carefully structured rehabilitative requirements merits consideration, aiming to reduce further criminality while maximising prospects of reintegration.
