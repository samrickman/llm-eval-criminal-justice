IN THE CROWN COURT AT WESTMINSTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. W2025/13467  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. K. MARTIN  
Filed: 15 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing on a single count, representative of a course of conduct relating to shoplifting offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, committed over a period stretching from late 2023 to early 2025. The offending occurred primarily within central Westminster, with some incidents also occurring in the adjoining boroughs of Camden and Lambeth.

Procedural History  
Your case emerged from an investigation instigated by the Westminster Retail Crime Partnership following a surge in reported thefts at several high-footfall convenience stores, small independent pharmacies, and one local charity shop. These establishments all fell within a roughly two-mile radius in the Westminster and Camden areas. Initial reports suggested isolated incidents, but a subsequent collation of CCTV footage, incident logs, and staff statements indicated a persistent pattern consistent with the intervention of a single individual.  
The investigation was notable for its multi-agency cooperation, involving the Metropolitan Police’s Business Crime Unit, local Council Trading Standards, and Westminster’s Safer Neighbourhood Teams. The Business Crime Reduction Partnership worked to collate detailed loss prevention data and to engage retail representatives for victim impact statements.  
The court notes that such collaboration, while advocated in policy literature as a standard model, is often frustrated in practice by the competing demands placed on frontline policing teams, divestment in community officers, and a chronic shortfall in dedicated resources for acquisitive crime investigations. Your case, however, proceeded with considerable diligence under the Better Case Management framework, notwithstanding some delays occasioned by the enabling of expert mental health assessment.

The Legal Aid Agency’s role has been subject to ongoing judicial scrutiny in cases of this nature. Here, prompt approval of funds for defence solicitor representation was initially secured. However, applications for expert psychiatric reports experienced delay due to procedural queries and required multiple follow-ups, not resolved until early July 2025. Such bureaucratic inefficiencies, whilst not endemic in every case, risk undermining the timely progression of justice and exacerbate the distress experienced by all participants.  
By way of illustration, one is reminded of the observations made in R v. Spencer [2023] EWCA Crim 579, wherein the Court of Appeal censured systemic delays in the funding of neurological expert assessments which hampered urgent trial preparations. Although the facts there do not align closely with the present, the principles of expediency and procedural fairness remain pertinent.

The case was initially listed for plea and trial preparation on 10 August 2025, but was adjourned at the defence’s request to allow for the filing of supplementary material, including witness statements from family members and letters from support agencies. These documents were subsequently reviewed and considered by the court.  

It is a commonplace observation that defendants charged with repeated theft offences often choose to deny or contest guilt until substantial evidence is presented. The practice of late guilty plea, whilst legally permissible, bears significant consequences for sentencing credit and the experience of victims brought into these proceedings. In R v. Chambers [2021] EWCA Crim 1203, the Court emphasised that discount for a plea must reflect genuine remorse and early acceptance, not tactical acquiescence in the face of overwhelming proof.

The public’s perception of retail crime is often coloured by misconceptions of triviality or victimlessness. Yet this case underscores the reality that shoplifting imposes tangible costs far beyond the immediate loss of goods. It affects staffing morale, leads to increased security measures, and contributes to rising insurance premiums, all borne ultimately by consumers and communities. The court acknowledges the written representations submitted by the Independent Retailers’ Forum, drawing attention to the human cost borne by small business employees who routinely face intimidation and reduced hours as a direct result of such offences.

Mr H’s defence solicitors, led by Mr Daniel Fairchild of Fairchild & Co., have mounted a thorough and conscientious defence and mitigation strategy. I recognise their attention to procedural detail and their engagement with relevant support services on behalf of the defendant. The Crown was ably represented by Ms Amara Singh of the CPS prosecuting team, whose submissions were detailed and proportionate.

The court further notes the logistical challenges faced by court administration in listing this matter for sentencing amid competing priorities, illustrating the continuing pressure on court resources in the post-pandemic environment. The delay between charge and sentencing—spanning some six months—is largely attributable to these systemic constraints.

In terms of context, it is germane to mention the historical evolution of the Theft Act 1968, which superseded various piecemeal common law provisions. Section 1 remains the principal statutory vehicle for prosecuting theft but has been supplemented by modern offences under the Fraud Act 2006 and regulations addressing electronic payment fraud and shoplifting prevention measures.

The sentencing framework is informed by guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council, notably the Theft Offences Definitive Guideline of 2019, which ranks offending by value, frequency, and aggravating features such as breach of trust or use of threats. While the value stolen in this case is relatively modest per incident, the multiplicity and persistence of offending elevate the culpability.

Of note is the case R v. Brooks [2024] EWCA Crim 165, which clarified that sentences in shoplifting cases should reflect not only the financial impact but also the cumulative effect on the stability of retail environments and community confidence. That judgment highlighted that even low-value theft can warrant custodial sentences where offending is opportunistic, calculated, and repeated.

The dynamics of shoplifting have evolved considerably in recent years, with growing use of electronic self-checkout technology, challenges of identification through mask-wearing, and increased sophistication by offenders in circumventing detection. There is evidence this case fits within that evolving criminal landscape.

Turning now to the factual matrix: the offences attributed to you span a number of local shops, including a delicatessen on Regent's Park Road, a pharmacy on Camden High Street, and a charity shop on Tottenham Court Road.

Your modus operandi involved entering premises during busy periods, using concealment techniques such as lined bags or removing price tags, and occasionally employing distraction methods when staff were present. Security footage captured you in possession of several small, otherwise untraceable goods.

The offences were opportunistic but characterised by consistency and persistence. Several witnesses reported feelings of unease and anxiety returning to their workplace, culminating in requests for shift pattern changes and closures of vulnerable displays during your known attendance periods.

A striking feature was your repeated targeting of certain goods with high resale value: over-the-counter medications, personal care products, and confectionery. Such patterns are not coincidental and suggest intent beyond mere impulse.

Despite multiple community resolution warnings and offers of assistance, you returned to shoplifting, undermining retail confidence and contributing to the weariness of businesses already facing the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic recovery phase.

Expert and Risk Assessments  
Prior to sentencing, the court ordered a psychiatric evaluation to ascertain any underlying clinical conditions that might bear on culpability or risk of reoffending. Dr Miriam Guest, consultant forensic psychiatrist, produced a comprehensive report, which was submitted and critically reviewed by defence and prosecution alike.  

Dr Guest noted that you do not meet criteria for a formal psychiatric diagnosis but exhibit traits of impulsivity, mild depressive symptoms, and low self-esteem. There was no evidence of psychosis, personality disorder of a severe degree, or cognitive impairment. The doctor recommended engagement with community mental health services and participation in structured offending behaviour programmes.

The pre-sentence report, compiled by the probation officer Ms Catherine Lang, assesses you as a moderate risk of reoffending based on static factors and current circumstances. It highlights history of unstable accommodation, intermittent employment, and fractured familial relationships. The report notes reluctance to engage consistently with support providers, particularly those focused on addiction and financial management.

It is a regrettable but all too common reality that probation services across London face chronic shortages of staff and resources, resulting in high caseloads and reduced capacity for sustained interventions. This systemic pressure constrains the intensity and frequency of supervision available to offenders in the community.

Letters of support filed on your behalf by the Westminster Homelessness Outreach Project and your sister, Ms Rachel H, underscore your commitment to addressing these underlying issues yet offer a tempered view regarding the risks inherent in your lifestyle and previous non-compliance.

The court takes this opportunity to record gratitude to these voluntary sector bodies, which perform an invaluable if often underappreciated role in managing the interface between criminal justice and social welfare.

It is also necessary to touch briefly on the wider constabulary approach to shoplifting. Rising theft reports in metropolitan centres have, at times, led to controversial policing strategies, including “no cold stop” approaches and diversion into civil action. The law enforcement emphasis remains on proportionate response but is complicated by resource allocation between acquisitive crimes and more serious offences. This balancing act is a subject of ongoing debate and policy review.

Further, the court acknowledges the expertise and diligent work of the Metropolitan Police’s digital forensic team, who undertook timely recovery of security footage and data extraction, despite competing demands from parallel investigations including several unrelated cases involving burglary and drug trafficking within the same operational area.

Sentencing Considerations  
The offending before the court is on a spectrum exceeding isolated incident theft. It involves calculated and repeated actions, showing disregard for community welfare and economic impact.

Whilst you eventually entered a guilty plea, this was proffered only after the trial window had opened and evidential pressures mounted. Accordingly, credit for plea must be discounted accordingly, in line with established appellate guidance including R v. Andrews [2020] EWCA Crim 323.

Mitigating factors include some evidence of personal difficulties and the lack of serious harm caused, but these are outweighed by your prior convictions and failure to desist despite intervention.

The court is mindful of the ongoing housing crisis, particularly the shortage of affordable and stable accommodation in central London, which acts as a backdrop to much offending of this kind. However, housing insecurity cannot be allowed to serve as a cloak for unlawful behaviour. Justice requires that each individual be held responsible for their actions, even amidst systemic failings.

The counsellors’ reports suggest a need for tailored interventions focusing on impulse control, financial management, and resolution of unstable relationships.

The sentencer’s task is to calibrate a sentence which serves the dual purposes of deterrence and rehabilitation whilst upholding the public’s confidence in the rule of law.

It is relevant to acknowledge your age of 34, the absence of violent offending, and the lack of involvement in organised crime or gang affiliations.

Nevertheless, the persistence of your offending necessitates a sentence reflecting the cumulative risk to premises, staff, and the local retail environment.

The court would be remiss not to place on record its appreciation for the staff supporting those affected by your conduct. Local shop managers provided victim personal statements, describing the erosion of worker confidence and the psychological toll exacted by recurrent theft and surveillance breaches.

In this, the case echoes findings in R v. Shepherd [2022] EWCA Crim 860, where targeting of vulnerable workers in retail led to a custodial term justified on grounds of public protection, even absent physical violence.

The complexity of shoplifting cases is further exacerbated by the broader social issues impinging on defendants’ lives: precarious employment, mental health challenges, addiction, and the fragmentation of community support networks.

This court laments the chronic resource shortfall in the National Health Service, with wait times for community mental health teams extending into the months, undermining early intervention potential.

Moreover, it is worth observing that the Probation Service nationally faces rising caseloads following legislative expansions via the Transforming Rehabilitation agenda. Officers now balance enforcement with rehabilitation under increasing operational pressure.

In sentencing, reference must also be had to the Sentencing Council’s 2025 guideline issuance addressing domestic burglary and acquisitive offences in urban areas, which emphasises the need to consider the broader impact on communities already burdened by social and economic disadvantage.

The court is mindful too of the role of restorative justice in shoplifting cases. Where victims and offenders are willing, structured conferencing can promote remediation and reduce repeat offending. No such offer was activated here or pursued.

Having considered all material, I shall direct the preparation of a custodial versus community sentence report, reflecting your current circumstances and the viability of structured interventions.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Westminster. The proceedings have been recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are advised of your right to appeal this sentence within 28 days under section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
