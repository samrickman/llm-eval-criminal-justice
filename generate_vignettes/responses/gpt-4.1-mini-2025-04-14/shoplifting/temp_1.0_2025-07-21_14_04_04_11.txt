IN THE CROWN COURT AT BERRYMOOR  
R v. MR. H  
Case No. T2025/14593  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. A. WINTERS   
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear today before this court for the purpose of sentencing following your conviction on a representative charge of theft, specifically multiple counts of shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct occurred over a sustained period extending from mid-2023 to the early months of 2025, and the offences involve a series of breaches committed at various retail establishments located within the Berry Moor and neighbouring districts.  

Procedural History  
Your case came to the court’s attention following an initial report on 12 March 2025 from the Berry Moor Retail Crime Taskforce, itself a partnership comprising the local police service, municipal licensing officers, and representatives of affected businesses within the town. This multi-agency taskforce was prompted by a notable uptick in incidents of theft, primarily small value items, which had cumulatively produced an atmosphere of unease among local shop staff and proprietors.  
The pattern of offending, which manifested as multiple discrete offences rather than a single event, is characteristic of a broader challenge faced by retail establishments in the current decade — that of low-level acquisitive crime that, while not violent, exerts significant cumulative harm across the sector. Such regionalised spikes, although sometimes fleeting, have been the subject of recent academic inquiry prompted by concerns around law enforcement resource allocation. For instance, the regional report published by the Midlands Policing Institute (2024) highlights that although shoplifting offences typically constitute a relatively small proportion of overall crime figures, they disproportionately affect independent retailers, many of whom operate on tight margins.  
In parallel to these broader societal observations, it is worth noting that this court routinely encounters cases wherein the resources devoted to resolving low-level thefts appear disproportionate in monetary terms relative to the value of goods involved. Nevertheless, such investments are necessary to uphold the rule of law, maintain public confidence, and deter escalation.  
Your arrest occurred on 30 March 2025, following an intensive operation coordinated by the Berry Moor Neighbourhood Policing Unit and augmented by the Regional Digital Intelligence Taskforce. That operation involved extensive analysis of CCTV footage, witness statements, and data derived from transit ticketing logs. This intensive investigation, extending over three weeks, culminated in your apprehension at the Berry Moor Bus Station. The decision to deploy mobile device tracking, authorised by a magistrate’s warrant issued on 12 March 2025, underscores the seriousness afforded to this investigation by law enforcement agencies.  
It should be recorded that the mobilisation of such investigatory powers is neither trivial nor routine. The necessity for judicial oversight attests to the balance that must be struck between individual privacy rights and public safety imperatives. Moreover, these techniques involve substantial expenditure both in human resources and technology. The opportunity cost in terms of personnel diverted from other pressing matters — such as violent crime investigations or missing persons enquiries — must be borne in mind.  
Following your arrest you were initially held in custody, but subsequently released on conditional bail with restrictions relating to your movements and non-engagement with retail premises within the borough. On 15 April 2025, you entered a not guilty plea at your initial Crown Court appearance.  
The pathway towards resolution was protracted. An application to the Legal Aid Agency to fund psychological expertise was submitted on 2 May 2025 but experienced considerable delay, not being granted until 23 June 2025. This delay was illustrative of ongoing systemic difficulties faced by defence teams in securing timely funding approval — a matter on which this court has repeatedly expressed concern. The delay hindered the preparation of your case and postponed the listing of sentencing, contributing to an extended period of uncertainty for all parties involved.  
The plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 18 August 2025, at which point you amended your plea to guilty. It is, regrettably, a familiar pattern within the contemporary justice system that guilty pleas in offences of this nature are often entered late in proceedings. The Court of Appeal has consistently emphasised, in cases such as R v. Wilton [2023] EWCA Crim 1502, that while a guilty plea remains a mitigating factor, its timing directly affects the extent of credit awarded. A plea entered just prior to trial does not provide the same measure of procedural economy nor necessarily reflect genuine remorse.  
The factual landscape underpinning your conviction has been diligently compiled by the prosecution and supported by numerous accounts from store employees, CCTV evidence, and forensic corroboration. These collectively establish a coherent pattern of offending with significant impact beyond immediate financial loss.

Whilst the charge before the court represents a single count, it is a ‘representative’ charge connoting a course of conduct that, if fully enumerated, would reveal multiple instances of theft from separate venues. The court is cognisant that such practices represent neither aberration nor singular lapses in judgment, but rather a deeply embedded pattern of behaviour that, in your case, displays both calculation and persistence.  
It is necessary, in setting the wider context, to observe the laudable efforts made by the Berry Moor Business Crime Partnership. This body, though constrained by limited personnel and budgetary pressures, has diligently maintained a victim liaison scheme which has afforded retail staff not only a channel for reporting but also access to psychological support where anxiety or trauma have been reported. It is noteworthy that this scheme has helped mitigate the cumulative stress inflicted by repeated theft-related encounters.

Discussion of this case inevitably invites reflection upon the broader institutional context within which such offending must be understood. For example, the pressures on local probation services have considerably intensified in recent years, with caseloads per supervising officer rising sharply in most jurisdictions. The National Probation Service Annual Report (2024) highlights that despite these elevated demands, resources remain constrained and programmes aimed at rehabilitation continue to be rationed.  
This systemic strain complicates the court’s task. While all parties, including probation officers and probation trusts, strive to manage reputational and operational risks effectively, the reality often entails overstretched providers who may struggle to deliver intensive interventions for individuals such as yourself. This underscores to the court the crucial need for continued development of targeted community rehabilitation programmes.  
Moreover, the court has been furnished with correspondence from local charities, including Berry Moor Community Support Network, which emphasises the persistent challenge of homelessness in the district, with associated substance misuse and mental health vulnerabilities. These factors, while not unique to your circumstances, form part of a mosaic of social complexities that pervade cases of this nature and must be borne in mind when constructing effective sentencing plans.

Turning to relevant case law, the Court of Appeal’s judgment in R v. Haddock [2022] EWCA Crim 1329 provides useful guidance regarding the assessment of sentence discounts where guilty pleas are tendered late in proceedings. That case involved a defendant convicted of aggravated burglary, who maintained a not guilty plea until the eleventh hour and thus received a significantly reduced credit. While serious aggravated burglary and low-level retail theft occupy vastly different planes of seriousness, the underlying sentencing principles apply consistently and reinforce the judiciary’s insistence on prompt admissions of responsibility.  
Similarly, the ruling in R v. Shawcross [2021] EWCA Crim 1849 reinforces the imperative to consider the broader community impact of acquisitive offending even where violence is absent. The Court cautioned sentencing courts against underestimating the psychological and economic consequences experienced by small business owners and their staff subjected to recurrent theft. That case involved offences at a market stall, where the shopkeeper received threats following the loss of critical stock items. While your conduct did not involve threats, the repeated breaches of trust and security engender distress not easily measured.  
The court also recalls R v. Dunlop [2020] EWCA Crim 1012 where a sentence for criminal damage was upheld following the defendant’s smashing of a bus shelter glass panel. That case brought into sharp relief the cultural damage wrought by repeated, low-level vandalism, creating an atmosphere of fear and neglect. Though unrelated to theft, the principles concerning community harm and deterrence are transferrable.

The factual circumstances leading to your conviction have been exhaustively catalogued. CCTV footage places you at multiple retail outlets engaging in systematic removal of goods without payment. In particular, the use of distraction techniques and concealment methods illustrate an advanced degree of premeditation.  
Staff testimony confirmed that your presence often occasioned considerable anxiety, particularly to junior employees who lacked the confidence to challenge your conduct directly. One shop assistant reported requesting a transfer from her post due to stress triggered by your repeated appearances. These facts illuminate the ongoing emotional and psychological harm inflicted on victims beyond mere financial loss.  
A number of the premises concerned had invested in enhanced loss-prevention technology, which your offences effectively circumvented. This represents an additional economic toll on businesses already contending with rising operational costs and supply chain disruption.  
Further incidents, including tampering with security tags and covertly switching price labels, betrays a tactically sophisticated approach that belies any characterization of your conduct as impulsively opportunistic.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The expert psychiatric report prepared by Dr. Marianne O’Hara, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, was submitted to assist the court’s understanding of your mental state and risk profile. Dr O’Hara found no evidence of major mental illness but described personality traits indicative of impulsivity and limited insight into the consequences of your behaviour. She noted a pattern consistent with intermittent substance misuse, which may have impaired judgment, but also placed emphasis on pervasive social factors such as unstable housing and lack of sustained employment.  
Her conclusion underscored that while there was no clinical justification for mitigation based on mental health, the presence of these psychosocial stressors suggested that interventions focussing on behaviour modification and social support could be of benefit.  
The Court therefore asked Probation Services to undertake a comprehensive assessment, including a formulation of potential rehabilitative pathways, which is awaited and will inform final sentencing decisions.

In preparation for these remarks, the court has carefully reviewed detailed victim impact statements kindly provided by the Berry Moor Business Crime Partnership. These documents articulate the cumulative effect of repeated theft — on individual employees’ sense of safety, workplace morale, and the financial viability of smaller retailers. The staff members’ responses to recorded loss included heightened vigilance, diminished job satisfaction, and in some cases, requests to reduce work hours or seek alternative employment.  
The loss sustained cumulatively amounts to several thousand pounds, a sum significant to the businesses involved. Several premises reported that the necessity to increase insurance premiums and install additional security devices had further strained already tight budgets.  
It must be emphasised that these are not abstract or theoretical harms. They reflect lived experience and tangible consequences for members of the public exercising their lawful right to conduct commerce free from theft.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The court also notes with interest the recent establishment of the Berry Moor Anti-Social Behaviour Taskforce, which operates alongside the Violence Reduction Unit but has recently expanded its remit to include acquisitive crime, particularly in retail environments. While this initiative has attracted local media attention, the practical outcomes remain to be evaluated, particularly as it currently lacks statutory enforcement powers. Nonetheless, its creation signals growing local commitment to addressing the intertwined challenges of community safety and retail crime reduction.  
In a tangential but illustrative development, the recent sentencing of Mr. Jonathan Neal [2025] BMC 1245 for possession of a bladed article in a school car park has raised important questions about youth exposure to potentially harmful environments. Although unrelated to your case and devoid of direct connection, the media coverage surrounding that sentencing arguably influences public perceptions of threat and safety in community spaces, shaping the environment in which shoplifting is judged socially and legally.  
Further afield, there have been reports of increasing rates of fly-tipping on protected green belt land within the Berry Moor district. While the court emphasises there is no suggestion of your involvement in such matters, these occurrences contribute to a general sense of declining order and community stewardship that frames the public response to low-level crime generally.

It is important to state at this juncture that no evidence indicates any association between you and organised criminal groups or gangs. Similarly, no coercive or controlling influence has been established. Your offending appears to
