IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. T2026/04217  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J. Pembroke  
Filed: 18 September 2026  

Mr H, you stand before this court to receive sentence following your conviction for offences of theft, specifically shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending alleged and proven reflects a series of episodes occurring intermittently over a period from early 2024 to mid-2026, predominantly committed within the Greater Manchester area across various retail environments. Your conduct has engaged the courthouses of this jurisdiction on multiple prior occasions, each with a similar factual matrix involving low-value theft but cumulative aggravation.  

Procedural History and Contextual Observations

You were initially arrested on 15 July 2026 following a detailed investigation undertaken by Manchester City Police’s Retail Crime Unit, in conjunction with the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP). The circumstances leading to your arrest followed a period in which retail premises in the north eastern quarter of the city repeatedly reported missing stock of particular goods — many susceptible to resale on the black market or informal trading networks. The investigative protocol adopted was multi-faceted, involving not only traditional policing methods but the utilisation of digital surveillance, forensic analysis of seized personal effects, and the coordination of intelligence between law enforcement and business security operatives.  

The court recognises, with no slight intended, the pressing demands currently imposed on police forces and the BCRP units in metropolitan connected metropolitan areas. These bodies juggle a plethora of priorities, ranging from monitoring gang-related activity to safeguarding vulnerable victims of domestic violence, whilst simultaneously attempting to curtail what may be characterised as lower-tier acquisitive crimes. Whatever the strategic emphasis, it is clear that the diversion of resources into cases such as this exerts inevitable pressures. That these pressures exist is not to diminish the significance of any one individual criminal episode; rather, it contextualises the backdrop against which such prosecutions take place.  

On 19 July 2026, following your interview pursuant to caution, and after forensic linkage of certain recovered items to your person, formal charges were preferred. Proceedings were allocated to the Crown Court at Manchester under the Better Case Management (BCM) system, with a plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) first listed for 25 August, subsequently vacated pending the receipt of Defence disclosure. You entered a not guilty plea at that stage.  

This court notes with some regret that delays occasioned by administrative bottlenecks — particularly within the Legal Aid Agency’s authorisation process for instructing expert defence witnesses — have regrettably lengthened the duration of the proceedings. Your case, although ultimately progressing within the broadly envisaged timelines, at times bore the hallmarks of systemic inertia. Such impediments are well documented more widely and remain an ongoing concern, as borne out by several recent reports commissioned by the Ministry of Justice. The impact of these delays is felt sharply by all involved — defendants, witnesses, courts, and indeed, frontline criminal justice practitioners.  

Subsequent to the PTPH, you maintained your defence, which advanced a range of denials and deflections, albeit somewhat inconsistently. Following the submission of compelling evidential materials by the prosecution, including further CCTV footage and witness statements, you reversed course by way of a late guilty plea on 3 September 2026, on the first day of trial.  

The principles governing the granting of credit for pleas remain as they have for some decades: consideration is to be given not merely to the fact of the plea but to its timing and the consequential saving to the court and witnesses. As elucidated in R v. Van Dongen [2005] EWCA Crim 2592 and reaffirmed in the recent authority of R v. Mays [2023] EWCA Crim 1051, pleas entered at the earliest opportunity merit greater credit than those tendered late, often perceived as tactical rather than remorseful. The present plea, coming at a late stage, may be accorded credit of reduced measure.  

At the sentencing hearing scheduled on this day, I have received detailed reports from probation services, inclusive of a pre-sentence assessment prepared under the auspices of Manchester Probation Trust. I wish to record my gratitude to Ms Fiona Melrose, the probation officer responsible for this assessment, whose report provides a comprehensive and nuanced portrait of your social circumstances, offending history, and potential for rehabilitation.  

I also thank Dr Jonathan Elridge, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose independent expertise has been sought at the request of the court pursuant to the interests of justice. Dr Elridge’s thorough evaluation explores psychological factors that may bear on your offending, whilst recognising the absence of any major psychiatric disorder. His detailed 16-page report dated 8 September 2026 articulates issues of impulse control, possible mild depressive symptomatology, as well as polysubstance use that may influence behavioural regulation.  

Reference also should be made to the written submissions received from the Bolton Retail Recovery Network, whose coordinators have provided a measured and carefully considered representation on behalf of impacted traders. Their communication draws attention to the cumulative effect of low-level theft on business viability, employment stability, and neighbourhood cohesion. While conceding that the defendant’s actions do not involve violence, their letter evinces the psychological toll experienced by retail staff and managers — a dimension often overlooked in prosecutions of this nature.  

It is also necessary to comment on the regrettable but not infrequent absence of media attendance during such proceedings. Although this court operates on principles of open justice and transparency, cases concerning acquisitive offending rarely attract journalistic interest unless augmented by sensationalist elements. This phenomenon raises questions about public engagement with the everyday administration of justice and prompts reflection on society’s perceptions of crime and its victims.  

In reference to the procedural history, the court notes that you, Mr H, have previously appeared before various magistrates’ courts within the greater Manchester area, including hearings held at Salford, Oldham, and Stockport, where charges relating to earlier thefts were considered. These hearings frequently involved pleas entered by post or by legal representatives, reflecting a degree of avoidance behaviour which may have hindered timely case resolution. The present series of offences, considered collectively, reveal a pattern that cannot, in justice, be placed in a separate category from your prior conduct.  

Several earlier cases were settled by way of conditional discharges or community sentences, with rehabilitation programmes proposed but inconsistently engaged with. The persistence of offending despite these interventions is of acute concern. The Ministry of Justice’s National Standards for Offender Management underscore the importance of continuity in support and monitoring. An evident failing in this regard, whether personal or systemic, must be appraised carefully in the context of sentencing.  

This court is also aware, from discussions with defence counsel and probation officers, of the challenges presented by your unstable housing situation. Currently residing in temporary accommodation provided through Manchester City Council’s Housing Allocation Scheme, your residential status is precarious. Homelessness and temporary shelter arrangements feature in many cases before this jurisdiction, presenting alongside a constellation of issues starkly outlined in contemporary social justice discourse. While the court acknowledges these hardships, it must clarify that such factors, whilst relevant for mitigation, do not amount to defences or justification for criminal conduct.  

It is perhaps pertinent here to consider the wider systemic backdrop: the strain on mental health services nationally — including delays in access to therapy, underfunding of community support groups, and acute staff shortages in the NHS — has been widely documented in successive government white papers. The court laments the pressures on these essential services, yet must operate within the law as it stands; the deficiencies in public provision remain a societal challenge but do not excuse breaches of the criminal law at the individual level.  

The court also acknowledges among the wider public service pressures the increasing complexity of the multi-agency response required in cases touching upon substance misuse, mental health concerns, and offending behaviour. The implementation of Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARAC), while more commonly associated with domestic abuse cases, reflects the increasing tendency towards integrated responses. Although your case does not strictly fall within a MARAC framework, the court concurs with probation’s appraisal that a coordinated approach could well benefit your specific circumstances, should appropriate agencies be engaged effectively.  

During the course of these proceedings, it has been noted that your communications with legal representatives have been at times inconsistent, with certain requests for adjournments and additional evidence eliciting delays. The court is mindful that some of these requests relate to procurement of supporting documents from family members and third-party organisations, including letters from social support charities, which do not always arrive within expected timelines due to operational limitations.  

Similarly, the court has reviewed several correspondence exchanges between your defence team and the Legal Aid Agency, evidencing difficulties in securing timely authorisation to instruct a forensic psychologist with expertise in impulsive acquisitive behaviour. This is regrettable and is symptomatic of broader system challenges in the provision of funded expert evidence in crime matters. It merits noting that in other, unrelated cases—such as R v. Bentley [2023] EWCA Crim 1345—the delays in instruction of psychiatric experts have been criticised as undermining the efficient conduct of justice. Such administrative impediments, though external to the defendant’s conduct, nevertheless bear tangentially on the proceedings’ cadence.  

The court is mindful, however, that the recognition of systemic challenges should not cascade into a diminution of individual responsibility. This general principle was clearly set out in R v. Matthews [2019] EWCA Crim 456, which emphasised that while social and structural factors may be borne in mitigation, they cannot absolve a defendant of accountability where harm or breach of law is manifest.  

Reference to analogous offences in case law may also be of assistance in sentencing calibration. In R v. Cartwright [2021] EWCA Crim 1202, the Court of Appeal considered a pattern of repeated thefts from a supermarket chain across a three-year period. Even where offending involved no physical violence or direct threats, an immediate custodial sentence was affirmed on account of the persistent nature of offending, the demonstrable planning involved, and the impact on staff morale and local community confidence. While the specific facts differ, Cartwright demonstrates the judiciary’s inclination to impose sentences reflecting a robust response to cumulative acquisitive crime where prior warnings have failed to deter.  

Another illustrative precedent is R v. Fitzsimmons [2018] EWCA Crim 1989, which concerned a defendant convicted of fly-tipping hazardous waste on protected green belt land. Though factually distinct, the Court underscored the gravamen of offences involving disregard for regulatory regimes and social norms. The message carried is unambiguous: offences that, on the face of it, may appear minor or technical, can attract heightened sentences where they symbolise contempt for societal expectations.  

It is also worthwhile recalling the case of R v. O’Connor [2022] EWCA Crim 777, involving a co-defendant in a separate matter currently at large following failure to attend court. This individual’s offending, though unrelated to your conduct, involved assault on arresting officers with improvised weapons. While clearly unrelated in culpability, the court must acknowledge that your case is not confounded by similar disorderly behaviour, which may be construed as a mitigating factor in relative terms.  

The court also notes, by way of passing, that a previous associate who attended a relevant trial involving co-accused parties in 2025 was found in possession of indecent images during a search unrelated to this matter. This is recorded solely as background information; no link or inference arises in relation to your behaviour.  

The preceding commentary serves to illustrate the broader legal landscape in which your sentence must be found. Its inclusion is not to obfuscate, but rather to ground the assessment within a robust judicial framework.  

Facts of the Offending

The facts of this case are as follows:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

Over the course of your offending, you have demonstrated both a repeated presence on CCTV systems, and activity consistent with the taking of various types of items, including but not limited to, convenience goods, over-the-counter medications, and modestly priced consumables. You utilised common tactics such as concealment in apparel and timed excursions to avoid close scrutiny.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

The evidence reveals episodes occurring within retail premises of differing sizes and staffing levels, ranging from larger supermarkets to small community-based shops. The impact upon staff, as described in victim impact statements, though not resulting in physical injury or threat, is nonetheless significant in terms of anxiety and diminished morale.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

In multiple incidents, items were taken bearing security tags which you were observed to remove or circumvent, indicating some degree of sophistication and forethought. This is not an impulsive or single act but rather a calculated course of conduct.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Even following warnings, community resolutions, and prior court interventions, the offending persisted. The cumulative nature of this repeat offending is central to the court’s serious consideration.

Expert and Probation Reports

Dr Elridge’s psychiatric evaluation summarises his conclusions in several cogent points. He observes an absence of diagnosable mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Instead, he highlights personality features that include low frustration tolerance, difficulties with sustained impulse control, and periods of low mood or mild depressive symptoms, possibly exacerbated by socio-economic deprivation. There is documented history of occasional recreational substance use — principally cannabis and, on occasion, alcohol — which have varying effects on risk-taking behaviour. Crucially, the doctor notes your lack of engagement with mental health services despite multiple recommendations, underscoring that underlying issues, if unaddressed, may perpetuate criminal conduct.  

The probation report supplies an extensive personal history which notes intermittent employment as a warehouse operative and peripheral involvement with informal cash-in-hand jobs. The report speaks to unsettled accommodation, fractured familial relationships with limited support, and a previous history of exclusion from educational settings. It also flags a medium risk of reoffending, predicated on the repetitive pattern observed and your apparent resistance to changing behaviour. Engagement levels with voluntary community services have historically been poor, though recent contacts suggest a modicum of openness to future participation.  

The court reminds itself of the sentencing framework applicable to theft under the Theft Act 1968 and the Sentencing Council guidelines. The offence category in this instance falls within those warranting consideration of either custody or community orders, depending on the totality of evidence, aggravating and mitigating factors, and the personal circumstances of the defendant. Aggravation here includes repetition, targeting of vulnerable premises, and impact on victim wellbeing; mitigation is limited primarily to your late plea of guilty and some element of personal hardship.  

I have also carefully considered the possibility of an immediate custodial sentence versus a community order supplemented by rehabilitation activities. Given the scale and persistence, the lack of prior custodial sentences solely on similar grounds, and the recommendations of probation, a nuanced response is required.  

The court is conscious of the importance of not merely responding punitively but fostering conditions conducive to desistance and reintegration. The cooperation of the probation service in devising tailored programmes spanning cognitive behavioural therapy, impulse control training, and vocational support is welcomed. Should these be successful, the benefits to public protection and to your personal welfare would be substantial.  

Conclusion and Directions

In conclusion, I have taken all of the foregoing into account. The offences committed by you are neither trivial nor isolated. They reflect a course of conduct resulting in tangible and intangible harm — financial, emotional, and communal. The court must uphold deterrent principles and acknowledge the frustration felt by retail victims and employing businesses. Equally, justice must be tempered by an informed understanding of your personal circumstances and prospects for rehabilitation.  

I am therefore directing that a pre-sentence report be prepared, reflecting the discussions herein and containing a structured proposal for an appropriate disposal. This evaluation should include consideration of the suitability for a community order featuring rehabilitation activity requirements, cognitive skills interventions, and where necessary, unpaid work. The report should also address any outstanding welfare needs and opportunities for engagement with support services.  

Further, I request that the probation officer liaise with the Business Crime Reduction Partnership to better inform the court on the local impact and to facilitate restorative justice options should they be suitable and consented to by all parties.  

Sentencing will be adjourned to a date fixed following receipt of the probation report — provisionally scheduled for 20 October 2026 — to allow a measured, informed determination. Counsel are reminded to submit any further representations or materials relevant to sentence not later than 13 October 2026.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. The proceeding has been recorded and transcribed pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. You, Mr H, are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are imposed. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
