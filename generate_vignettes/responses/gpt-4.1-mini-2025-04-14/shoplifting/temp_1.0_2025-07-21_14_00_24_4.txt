IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14537  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge B. L. Pennington  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of offences of theft from retail premises committed over a substantial period extending from late 2023 through to the spring of 2025. These offences, all of which fall under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, involved a variety of locations across the Brighton and Hove area, including several independent stores and well-known chain outlets.  

Procedural History and Case Progression  
Your case has made its way through the criminal justice system over several months, with an initial appearance at the Brighton Magistrates' Court on 18 February 2025. During that hearing, the prosecution formalised charges based on a representative count, consolidating multiple incidents into a single indictment for efficient trial management in the Crown Court. The transfer was subject to the Better Case Management (BCM) regime, as set out under Practice Direction 51Z, which aims to expedite proceedings and facilitate early identification of issues for trial. Early hearings took place on 20 March and 15 April, respectively. There were minor delays attributable in part to the defence’s outstanding application for Legal Aid and the securing of funding to instruct an independent psychiatric evaluation. These administrative matters are unfortunate but emblematic of the systemic pressures now pervasive within publicly funded legal representation.   

The Legal Aid Agency’s performance, regrettably, has once again contributed to a degree of procedural inertia. Mr H’s counsel raised the necessity of instructing Dr Karen Simmons, a forensic psychologist with expertise in acquisitive offending and impulse control disorders. Initial correspondence from the defence solicitor dated 21 March 2025 was met with protracted delays—approvals not granted until mid-April despite multiple follow-ups. Such delays inevitably impede timely and thorough preparation and are a cause of considerable frustration across the judiciary. The court records its unease with this recurring theme, one that appears systemic rather than exceptional.  

Meanwhile, the police investigation that precipitated these proceedings was notable for its multi-agency dimension. Alongside officers from the Sussex Police, the Brighton and Hove Business Crime Reduction Partnership and local council enforcement teams coordinated efforts to monitor repeated theft occurrences. The intelligence unit’s scrutiny encompassed cross-referencing CCTV footage with loss prevention reports, an exercise made all the more challenging by the transient nature of some offending patterns. This operation was resource-intensive and extended over several months, relying heavily on regional surveillance infrastructure and painstaking manual collation of evidence. The digital forensic analysis requisitioned to verify the defendant’s involvement was carried out by officers within the Sussex Police Cybercrime Unit, whose workloads in the past year have escalated markedly owing to burgeoning demands in the areas of fraud and cyber-enabled crime.    

I take this opportunity to acknowledge the professionalism of the court staff involved in listing and the courtroom ushers, whose roles in maintaining procedural decorum and assisting all participants are often underappreciated. The refurbishment of Courtroom 5, completed earlier this year, provides an environment conducive to the dignified conduct of proceedings, which is no small matter given the gravity of the judicial task.  

The BCM listing on 15 April included an initial plea and trial preparation hearing. The defence initially entered a not guilty plea. However, in view of compelling evidence assembled by the Crown, a plea change to guilty was tendered on the morning of the trial scheduled for 13 June 2025. It is regrettable that the plea change came at this late juncture. The court is mindful of established precedent, including R v. King [2019] EWCA Crim 251, which reaffirms that credit for guilty pleas is contingent upon their timeliness and the degree to which they save court time and spare witnesses from the ordeal of testifying. Late pleas, especially those effected after the close of the prosecution case or on the eve of trial, attract markedly reduced sentence discounts.  

Analogy may be found in R v. Heaton [2022] EWCA Crim 458, a matter concerning residential burglary, where the Court of Appeal underscored that last-minute pleas often cannot be regarded as indicative of genuine remorse but rather of tactical acceptance of the inevitable verdict. Though factually different, the principle that late pleas carry diminished mitigation is firmly embedded in our sentencing framework and applies equally here.  

In the area of sentencing law, recent decisions have increasingly emphasized the need to balance punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation. The Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences, issued in 2017 and subsequently amended, provides a structured approach, identifying harm (both economic and psychological), culpability, and mitigating circumstances. The guideline advises particular attention to repeat offending patterns and the impact on victims, staff, and community confidence.

It must be acknowledged that while the value of goods taken may appear modest individually, the cumulative detriment in cases like this is substantial. The loss suffered by small businesses, which often operate with narrow margins and limited security resources, extends beyond mere financial cost to include disruptions in staffing, increased vigilance, and in some cases closure of local services.  

In the present case, the prosecution relied heavily on a series of coded store incident reports and amassed digital evidence showing your involvement, cross-linked through time-stamped video footage and witness testimony. Store managers, while endeavouring to maintain a professional bearing, expressed concerns over the repeated intrusions and the toll on staff morale. Some employees altered working patterns to avoid lone working during hours when you were observed frequenting premises.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

This pattern of persistent targeting is of particular importance when considering the risk you pose to the community. Unlike isolated incidents borne of momentary lapses, repeated acquisitive offending by one individual signals an entrenched behavioural pattern less amenable to spontaneous reform. This echoes guidance articulated in R v. Blackmore [2020] EWCA Crim 1089, where repeat offending and failure to engage with rehabilitative services militated against non-custodial outcomes.   

It is well understood that the modern Crown Court performs a multifaceted function: an arena not only for the determination of liability but also for the calibration of proportionate responses to crime that balance the needs of justice, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. Your case presents a familiar tableau in this respect, where the apparently low-level nature of the theft belies broader issues of social integration and personal stability.  

The probation service has been engaged since the adjournment for assessment in late July. Their detailed Pre-Sentence Report, compiled by Officer Laura Jennings, provides valuable insights into your personal circumstances, history, and prospects for rehabilitation. The report notes your current status as 34 years old, with a history of precarious housing and intermittent employment in the restaurant sector. It also references a prior conviction for shoplifting dated 2021, for which a conditional discharge was imposed.

The report flags a history of non-engagement with support services and reservations about existing charitable assistance. It further highlights an absence of any significant mental health diagnosis, although traits consistent with low impulse control and situational stress are noted. Dr Simmons’ forensic psychological evaluation, submitted contemporaneously, corroborates these findings, observing that while you exhibit no formal psychiatric disorder, certain cognitive-behavioural vulnerabilities may underlie the offending pattern.  

The court is conscious of the well-documented pressures on community mental health services, the often-lengthy waiting lists for specialist interventions, and the uneven availability of tailored programmes for offenders like yourself. NHS England’s recent Annual Mental Health Report (2024) emphasises the need for early identification and intervention in cases where psychological vulnerabilities intersect with criminal conduct to mitigate reoffending risks. While the court sympathizes with systemic challenges, it must also recognise that limited service capacity cannot excuse or diminish culpable behaviour.

Turning to the impact on the victims, written submissions were provided by the Brighton Independent Retailers’ Association, which represents a number of shops affected by your offending conduct. Their letter conveys the cumulative strain endured, including the necessity for additional security measures and the erosion of goodwill in the wider business community. There is particular mention of the strain placed upon small pharmacy staff, some of whom reported feelings of vulnerability and distress, citing the normalisation of harassment in the workplace as a broader societal issue.  

The Retail Support Network, a voluntary sector organisation specialising in victim support in acquisitive crime cases, has supplemented these accounts with its own observations. Their workers have been assisting affected employees since early 2025, providing emotional support and guidance on workplace safety measures. While their remit is not to influence sentencing, the court acknowledges their professional commitment in a sector under increasing pressure.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

It is worthwhile to note that this case-of-concern occurs within a wider national context of increasing load on police and public services arising from what are sometimes termed “volume crimes.” The Home Office Crime Statistics Report (2024) indicates that theft-related offences have risen marginally in most urban venues, with shoplifting constituting a significant component. This places front-line officers under sustained pressure, frequently detracting resources from serious and violent crime investigation.  

As with many areas of public services, the phenomenon is compounded by social issues such as homelessness and substance misuse. For example, reports from the Brighton Homeless Outreach Team indicate that street-level begging and rough sleeping have climbed substantially over the past two years, straining local emergency accommodation and care provisions. While such factors are not causative per se, they provide important background context for the court’s evaluation of offenders embedded within these environments.  

In the ancillary case law, reference may also be made to R v. Wiseman [2018] EWCA Crim 976, wherein the Court of Appeal considered the interplay between socio-economic hardship and persistent offending. The judgment has been cited in numerous subsequent cases underscoring the principle that while hardship may explain conduct, it does not excuse it. Agencies and courts alike are urged to adopt a holistic approach, incorporating rehabilitative opportunities alongside necessary punitive responses.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

It is pertinent to mention that no allegation of violence, intimidation, or threat was connected to your offending behaviour. The pattern exhibits calculated, non-violent acquisitive crime. Nevertheless, the normalisation of theft in certain communities has been identified by the Brighton Safer Neighbourhood Board as a concerning trend, linked to disaffection and fragmented social supports.  

In a very different context, the Court of Appeal in R v. Deacon [2023] EWCA Crim 334 examined an offending course involving assault and public disorder, highlighting the need for proportionate punishment tailored to offence gravity and public interest. That case underscores, by contrast, the relative distinctiveness of non-violent theft offences, even as it reinforces the need for deterrence and community protection as elements of sentencing.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The breadth of the evidence demonstrates a degree of forethought, consistency, and repeat engagement in offending episodes, which militates against leniency solely on the basis of a lack of violence. Your conduct caused measurable disruption and distress, impacting not only the commercial operators directly but the stability of service provision in affected areas.  

In relation to other matters, it is noted the court has received correspondence from your family, including a letter from your elder sister, Ms Emily H., who expresses concern for your welfare and urges the court to consider your background and need for appropriate support as part of sentencing. While these representations are appreciated, it is for the court to assess all material factors, including risk and culpability, in arriving at a just and proportionate outcome.  

Adjacent to your case, the court has been apprised of an incident involving a co-defendant, Mr L., who is not before this court today. It is on record that Mr L. absconded from police supervision and is currently subject to active warrant for arrest. That individual’s conduct, which involved violent disorder at a separate location, has no bearing on your culpability and should not be conflated with your case.  

Similarly, other unrelated events have delayed court listings. For instance, an arson incident affecting Court 4 on 22 September 2025 necessitated a temporary suspension of proceedings and relocation of hearings to ancillary rooms. Such events are regrettable but underscore the unpredictability of court operations during periods of transient emergency.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

For completeness, the Probation Service’s assessment has noted the absence of gang affiliation or links to organised crime, which differentiates your profile from certain acquisitive offenders known to regional enforcement units. There is also no evidence of coercion or exploitation by third parties, which sometimes complicates matters in cases involving vulnerable individuals.  

Sentencing Considerations  
Having regard to the statutory purposes of sentencing under the Sentencing Act 2020, including punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection, the court must carefully weigh your personal circumstances alongside the gravity of the offences and wider societal impact. Your antecedents show a propensity for repeat offending, and your engagements with support services have been, at best, intermittent.  

The late guilty plea, although welcome, offers limited mitigation given its timing on the eve of trial. Your co-operation is noted, but the court maintains the principle that early acceptance of responsibility is the most effective means of earning sentence discount.  

Community-based options remain under consideration. The Pre-Sentence Report explores the feasibility of a Suspended Sentence Order incorporating requirements such as unpaid work and attendance at a Cognitive Skills programme specifically targeted at acquisitive offending. The assessment notes some ongoing housing instability, which may affect the practicality of community sanctions; such factors will be considered further upon sentence.  

Courts must also send a clear message that repeated theft undermines community safety and damages the social fabric. The economic impact on small retailers and the psychological toll on front-line staff are real and deserving of respect. Where offences exhibit systematic planning, persistence, and disregard for repeated interventions, custodial sentences cannot be excluded.  

Before concluding, I must acknowledge the diligent efforts of Ms Claire Montgomery, prosecuting counsel, and Mr Neil Fraser, representing the defence through Legal Aid. Their advocacy has been thorough and professional.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this 14th day of October 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Brighton. A full transcript has been recorded by the court reporter in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentence will be deferred pending receipt of the finalised Pre-Sentence Report. The defendant is hereby advised of the right of appeal within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are engaged pursuant to Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
