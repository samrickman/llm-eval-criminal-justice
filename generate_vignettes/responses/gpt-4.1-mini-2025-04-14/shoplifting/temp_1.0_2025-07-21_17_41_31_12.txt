IN THE CROWN COURT AT MIDLANDS CENTRAL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. MC2025/15432  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. A. Pembroke  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today for the purpose of sentencing in relation to a charge under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically concerning a course of thefts from retail premises commonly understood as shoplifting. The conduct in question extended over a period beginning in late 2023 through to May 2025, and took place primarily within the jurisdictions of Coventry and Birmingham, with ancillary incidents noted in nearby towns. The charge before the court is representative of that series of incidents.

Procedural Background  
You were initially arrested on 3 June 2025, following an investigation carried out by the West Midlands Retail Crime Task Force in conjunction with the Coventry Police Neighbourhood Team and supported by the Midlands Business Crime Partnership. This investigation arose out of repeated reports from a consortium of independent retailers who had observed a pattern of thefts characterised by the same modus operandi involving the concealment of items and avoidance of payment, yet rendered more complex by the transient nature of the defendant’s movements across multiple locations. The collation of relevant recorded material—including extensive closed-circuit television footage—and witness statements was comprehensive, reflecting cooperation among several agencies despite prevailing resource pressures.

These proceedings have proceeded under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, designed to facilitate earlier identification of issues, reduce unnecessary delay, and secure progression in line with Criminal Procedure Rules guidelines. Much credit is due to all parties in ensuring at least partial compliance with these operating standards. Nevertheless, there were adjournments necessitated by matters including the late disclosure of certain exhibits, the scheduling constraints resultant from industrial action affecting witness availability, and the late application to secure legal aid funding for a psychiatric evaluation on your behalf. These matters, regrettably, are reflective of broader systemic challenges within the justice system.

In terms of timetabling, the provisional date for sentence was originally set for 15 August 2025 but was adjourned at short notice following the defence’s request to tender additional character references and documentation relating to your personal circumstances and support network. The supplementary materials were received and considered by the court, the latter of which notably included commendations from staff members of local voluntary organisations addressing homelessness and debt counselling. I acknowledge this court’s longstanding recognition of the critical role such voluntary sector bodies play in supporting those at risk of marginalisation, even as they struggle with chronic underfunding and escalating demand.

The Crown is represented by Ms Eleanor Fairclough, whose submissions were clear, thorough, and measured; defence counsel, Mr Simon Reid, appeared under a representation order and made detailed representations on your behalf. I place on record my gratitude to both counsel for their professionalism, despite the inevitable frustrations posed by Legal Aid authorisation delays—a systemic issue currently under significant scrutiny nationwide.

It is important to note that while your pleas of guilty were entered at the outset of today’s hearing, the court heard first an application for reports, specifically a pre-sentence report and a supplementary psychiatric assessment. These are to be awaited before sentence is passed.

Contextual Matters and Wider Public Policy Considerations  
It must be conceded that acquisitive offending such as shoplifting occupies a complex space within the criminal justice landscape. On the one hand, it is often categorised as low-level crime, with comparatively low pecuniary value involved in individual acts. On the other, it resonates powerfully with wider social anxieties, ranging from the erosion of community cohesion to economic decline and personal safety fears. The cumulative impact of repeated thefts, especially from small businesses or vulnerable outlets, can be significant. Losses in revenue strain already precarious operations, ultimately affecting employees, supply chains, and consumer choice.

Within this broader discourse, this court is mindful of findings presented by the Midlands Regional Crime Analysis Unit’s 2024 report into retail crime trends, which suggests an upward trajectory in the frequency of shoplifting incidents, particularly those involving repeated offenders. That report, while acknowledging methodological limitations linked to underreporting and potential duplication of incidents, underscores the disproportionate burden placed on smaller retailers, many of whom have little recourse beyond increasing physical security measures or limiting stock visibility. The local Business Crime Reduction Partnerships across the West Midlands attempt to address these issues by implementing preventive strategies, intelligence sharing, and offender interventions, though their efficacy often fluctuates in response to fluctuating funding and staffing capacity.

Further, it would be remiss not to record the difficult environment within which policing and ancillary services operate. The prolonged austerity measures applied to local authorities have resulted in cuts to frontline officers, community outreach programmes, and the diversionary services that might prevent offending at the outset. Allied to this are the persistent challenges faced by mental health and addiction support services, which in many areas continue to run well beyond capacity, with waiting times extending to several months for routine appointments. This situation restricts the availability of early intervention opportunities for individuals who might otherwise avoid involvement with the criminal justice system altogether. The court notes with interest ongoing efforts by the West Midlands NHS Trust to pilot integrated justice-health liaison teams aimed at bridging these gaps.

Public defence funding, administered via the Legal Aid Agency, remains an area of concern. I note, not for the first time, the difficulties experienced in securing timely authorisations for access to expert evidence, particularly in cases where underlying vulnerability or mental health may be relevant. The bureaucratic inertia, multi-tiered application processes, and limited availability of suitably qualified experts have been cited in several parliamentary inquiries and independent reviews. The cumulative effect is to place additional strain on defendants’ rights and professional representatives alike, as exemplified by the delay in obtaining approval for instructing a forensic psychiatrist in the present matter.

Case Law Considerations  
In the assessment of suitable sentence, the court is guided primarily by the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences issued in 2020, which emphasises the importance of considering the value, harm, culpability, and previous convictions of the defendant. The guideline stresses that while theft is a crime against property, it is also fundamentally a crime against the person insofar as it violates notions of trust and security.

Relevant case law further informs the approach to sentencing. In R v. Neville [2019] EWCA Crim 1324, the Court of Appeal reiterated that repeated thefts, even low-value, may cumulatively warrant a custodial sentence where there is evidence of planning, persistence, and disregard for previous warnings. The judgment noted that community resolutions and suspended sentences had limited deterrent effect where the offender persists in similar conduct.

Similarly, R v. Coleman [2021] EWCA Crim 1567 highlighted that aggravating factors such as breaches of bail conditions, offending within vulnerable premises, or conduct causing distress to retail staff may elevate the seriousness of what might otherwise be considered minor offences. The court reinforced the principle that proportionate sentencing must take account not only of the monetary value but also the broader social and psychological impact.

In the unrelated but illuminating case of R v. Blanchard [2022] EWCA Crim 210, the defendant was sentenced for aggravated burglary involving entry into a private dwelling during occupants’ absence on holiday. Although dissimilar in subject matter, the Court’s observations on the importance of respecting personal and property boundaries bear some conceptual resonance, underscoring the fine line between opportunism and disregard for societal norms.

Further noted—and contrasted—for completeness is R v. Grayson [2020] EWCA Crim 901, concerning fly-tipping on green belt land, which established that the environmental damage occasioned by waste dumping, while quantified financially, took on greater significance due to its effects on public amenity, wildlife habitat, and community safety. That principle of considering non-pecuniary harm aligns with the recognition that theft offences, similarly, may bear complex consequences beyond mere loss of goods.

Incident Details and Facts of the Offence  
The facts of the case are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

Your actions were not confined to isolated or accidental misopportunities. The evidence demonstrates a systematic approach: utilizing unoccupied aisles to conceal merchandise, evading detection by staff, and frequently returning to the same outlets. There are recorded instances where you employed distraction tactics, including engaging other customers in conversation or feigning mobile phone calls to detract attention.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

The scale of the offence is augmented by repeated breaches of store bans imposed following previous incidents. Your disregard for these preventative measures speaks to a pattern, one which undermines the efficacy of civil remedies and necessitates judicial intervention.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Letters submitted on your behalf attest to a degree of personal challenge, including financial instability and periods of insecure housing. There are references to engagement with community support providers, though the quantity and depth of such interactions appear limited.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

Defence submissions rightly point to the importance of treating underlying issues such as impulsivity and substance use disorders within sentencing frameworks. The court recognises the gradually evolving focus upon rehabilitation and desistance, as exemplified in the introduction of community payback orders accompanied by embedded therapeutic processes.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Despite the non-violent nature of your conduct, the ramifications on frontline retail staff have been significant. Victim impact statements convey feelings of vulnerability and diminished workplace morale, further compounded by the financial losses that affect operational sustainability.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

An additional concern arises from your previous engagement with diversionary programmes, which appear to have failed in effecting behavioural change. This aligns with observations in the probation service reports of intermittent compliance and apparent ambivalence toward rehabilitative efforts.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

Psychiatric and Probation Reports  
Dr Simon Kershaw, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was instructed to prepare an independent assessment. In his report dated 12 September 2025, Dr Kershaw notes that while Mr H does not meet diagnostic criteria for any major psychiatric disorder, he exhibits traits consistent with impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and mild symptoms compatible with a borderline pattern of emotional regulation. Importantly, no evidence of psychosis or personality disorder of sufficient severity was identified. Dr Kershaw’s view is that these traits may exacerbate vulnerability to substance misuse and poor decision-making, contributing to the offending pattern.

Similarly, the probation officer’s pre-sentence report portrays you as a man facing considerable personal challenges, including unstable accommodation, limited employment history, and a fragile support network. The report underscores the risk of recidivism in the absence of sustained intervention, particularly highlighting concerns regarding substance use and low engagement with statutory and voluntary services. Recommendations include consideration of a community order with a rehabilitation activity requirement, alongside structured drug and alcohol treatment.

While sympathetic to the underlying difficulties observed, the court emphasises that these do not diminish criminal responsibility. The availability of support services—themselves under strain—is not unconditional, and offenders must demonstrate a genuine commitment to change.

It is a recurring theme in criminal justice that defendants with histories of deprivation and adversity present complex profiles. The balance is delicate: courts must weigh compassion with deterrence, and individualised justice with public protection.

Other Procedural and Contextual Observations  
The court notes that one co-defendant involved in this wider investigation remains at large, having failed to appear at initial hearings. This has occasioned additional investigative resources and procedural delay.

Furthermore, an unrelated charge involving a former roommate of the defendant emerged during the investigative phase. This individual faced possession of Class B substances; however, these matters have been kept distinct and bear no relevance to the defendant’s own conduct or risk profile.

An unrelated matter arising within the precinct relates to an ongoing police review of noise complaints made against the landlord of the defendant’s last known accommodation. While tangential, these issues illustrate the complexity of addressing criminality and social disorder in tandem.

The court also records the historic establishment of the Midlands Central Crown Court in 1973 as part of a wider judicial reform intended to consolidate resource allocation and improve case processing efficiency. The court building underwent refurbishment in 2018, including updated security and facilities for vulnerable witnesses, reflecting contemporary best practice.

Finally, in an unrelated case decided in this jurisdiction in December 2024, R v. Halvorsen, the Court of Appeal dealt with an arson offence involving deliberate damage to a communal block, underscoring the potential consequences of deliberate, repeated offending upon community safety and public confidence.

Sentencing Considerations  
In light of the foregoing, I must now turn to sentencing. The offences before the court, while involving modest monetary value individually, form part of a persistent and calculated pattern. There has been little apparent remorse or acceptance of responsibility until the final hearing, and prior interventions have not produced cessation.

The court must take a measured approach, balancing the gravity of the offences, impact upon victims, and need for personal rehabilitation.

Taking into account the late plea entered today, I remind counsel that credit for guilty plea is discretionary and reflective of timeliness. Given that the plea was entered at the earliest possible stage of today’s proceedings, appropriate credit will be given. However, should it be found that the plea was made only when conviction was inevitable, the discount applied will be accordingly moderated, consistent with R v. Halvorsen and R v. Haslow.

Furthermore, the court recognises the absence of any prior custodial sentence but notes the repeated nature of the offending and prior conditional discharges.

In accordance with Sentencing Council guidance, custody must be considered where the offence is serious, or when community orders are unlikely to suffice. Here, the recurring disregard for prior warnings and community interventions weighs heavily.

Nevertheless, the fundamentally non-violent nature of the offending, the stated personal difficulties, and the probation and psychiatric recommendations support exploration of community-based disposals, subject to structuring that ensures public protection.

I will therefore adjourn sentence pending receipt of the final pre-sentence report, which should address risk, amenability to rehabilitative measures, and suitability for a community order incorporating rehabilitation and unpaid work as appropriate.

I remind all parties that the ultimate determination will be made in this court, and any proposed conditions must be consistent with principles of proportionality, public safety, and the promotion of desistance.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Midlands Central. Proceedings have been transcribed in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentencing will be submitted to relevant registries and authorities accordingly. The defendant is informed of the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to sections 108 and 112 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged, and costs remain reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
