IN THE CROWN COURT AT LIVERPOOL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. L2025/14327  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. R. MASTERS  
Filed: 14 November 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for a continuing course of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending in question concerns multiple occasions spanning a period from November 2023 to September 2025, and principally concerns thefts from various shops across the Liverpool city centre and surrounding districts, including Liverpool One shopping precinct and Aigburth Road retail areas.

This court is, regrettably, no stranger to cases of this nature, which, while classified legally as “minor” offences, carry significant cumulative consequences both for victims and community confidence. It is commonly observed, and not without justification, that town centres suffer from what might be called an ‘erosion of the shopping environment’ not solely due to sporadic acts of acquisitive crime, but a widening pattern of that theft which imposes costs and anxiety on proprietors, employees, and the public alike. However, it is the role of this court, as the ultimate arbiter of justice in serious criminal matters, to address these behaviours within the parameters of law tempered by circumstance, not social commentary or political preference.

Procedural History  
The case against you was built following a joint operation involving officers from Merseyside Police’s City Centre Team, supplemented by investigators attached to the Regional Retail Crime Intelligence Unit. The endeavour included co-ordination with the Liverpool Retail Crime Forum and several local business improvement districts. The protracted investigative phase was marked by the careful compilation of testimony, the painstaking analysis of CCTV footage from as many as seventeen retail outlets, and the gathering of physical evidence recovered at the scene of arrest.

It is to be noted—with particular emphasis—that the investigative resources deployed here were considerable. The expense of such operations is not trivial, including overtime payments for officers, specialist forensic and analytical input, and the administrative burden on support staff preparing exhaustive disclosure packages. This is a sobering reminder that even offences involving seemingly modest monetary values may require energy and resource that might otherwise be diverted. The operational priorities of the force, meanwhile, continue to face intensifying demands from serious knife crime, drug trafficking and organised gang violence. The allocation of time to persistent theft cases amidst such pressures is indicative of their cumulative public significance.

Incidentally, the court is compelled to observe that the phenomenon of protracted investigations is exacerbated by the recent Digital Evidence and Technology Act reforms, which, despite laudable aims, have introduced additional technical and procedural layers prior to charge. This has led to a not insignificant backlog of evidential examination in forensic suites — particularly those dealing with retail-related offences that involve video and phone data.

Your initial arrest took place on 5 October 2025, following surveillance at the aforementioned Liverpool One complex. You were interviewed under caution and refused to provide a substantive account. Forensic examination of clothing recovered from your person and lodgings subsequently matched fibres consistent with those on reported stolen property.

A first hearing was held before Liverpool Magistrates’ Court on 12 October 2025, at which bail was granted with conditions excluding contact with specified retail premises. The matter was swiftly transferred to this court in accordance with the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative, aimed at improving timeliness and informational clarity in cases involving multi-count dishonesty or complexity.  

The BCM process is not without faults. While designed to reduce delay and duplication, it sometimes encounters difficulties in cases where defendants have fluctuating legal representation or where external expert reports are required and funding approvals protract preparation. Indeed, it is worth registering an institutional grievance with the Legal Aid Agency’s continuing revisions to its decision-making protocols, which have led to delays in certain authorisations, including this one. The court understands the resource constraints the Agency operates under but must nevertheless note the detriment protracted applications cause both to the accused and to the wider administration of justice.  

A plea and trial preparation hearing was listed on 23 October 2025 and, although you originally entered a not guilty plea, you subsequently notified the court via your defence counsel, Mr Ian Fletcher of the Liverpool Legal Defence Panel, of your intention to tender a guilty plea shortly before this sentencing hearing.  

The pattern of late pleas in cases of this nature is a subject of increasing judicial concern. The Court of Appeal in R v Aldridge [2023] EWCA Crim 1249 emphasised that credit for guilty plea should proportionately reflect the timing and quality of the admission. An initial or early plea, typically at the first realistic opportunity, facilitates genuine mitigation, conserves public resources, and lessens the trauma for victims and witnesses. Pleas adduced only after careful preparation and when the case is manifestly made do not attract similar benefits. That principle underlies the court’s approach here.

Legal Context  
The offence before the court falls under the Theft Act 1968, with section 1 defining theft as the dishonest appropriation intending permanently to deprive the owner. The Sentencing Council’s Theft Definitive Guideline (effective date: October 2019) provides the framework for sentence determination, emphasising culpability, harm, the impact on victims, and the offender’s antecedents. 

Though shoplifting is often viewed as low-impact, persistent acquisitive offending has a substantial aggregate effect on retail businesses, often leading to increased prices, loss of livelihoods, and degraded community amenity. This must be reflected in sentencing to deter repeat conduct and signal the societal gravity of such crimes.

The court also draws attention to the authority of R v Giles [2022] EWCA Crim 1765, which concerned a serial shoplifter with prior convictions whose offending was found to demonstrably diminish staff wellbeing and cause reactionary changes in workplace practices, leading to indirect economic harm. The Court there affirmed the propriety of custodial sentences for those who persist despite prior warnings and community resolutions.

Moreover, while not strictly analogous, the observations in R v Jefferies [2021] EWCA Crim 981, concerning the necessity of proportionality in sentences involving acquisitive offences committed within supported accommodation, inform this court’s consideration of mitigating factors related to housing instability and mental health.

Noteworthy, too, is the long-standing jurisprudence approaching plea credits, as reiterated in R v Dearnley [2021] EWCA Crim 581, underscoring how tardy admissions reduce the deduction otherwise available for guilty pleas.

As to background considerations, the court is mindful of the chronic under-provision in mental health and social care sectors, and the increasing interface between public protection mandates and health care deficiencies. These systemic pressures cannot be ignored but neither can they excuse unlawful conduct.

From the perspective of family and social context, it bears mention that defendants in these cases often present with fractured networks and limited access to informal support, factors which sometimes compound offending behaviour but, conversely, cannot be seen as mitigating in sole isolation.

Incidentally, the court notes that the upper gallery of the courtroom was refurbished in August 2024. The enhancements included improved lighting and sound provisioning, aimed at increasing public accessibility to criminal hearings, thereby upholding the principle of open justice. Unfortunately, attendance on the public benches remained sparse throughout today's proceedings, a long-standing issue in retail crime cases lacking sensational elements.

The Crown extends thanks to Ms Felicity Nguyen, prosecuting, whose written submissions and advocacy were clear and measured. The defence was ably represented throughout by Mr Ian Fletcher, whose persistent attempts to navigate complex Legal Aid delays are acknowledged notwithstanding their frustrating impact on case progression.

The Probation Service, under the leadership of Supervising Officer Ms Deborah Simmons, has provided an initial risk and background summary. The Service continues to operate with reduced staffing levels due to recruitment difficulties and increased caseload, a fact which impacts their ability to provide timely and comprehensive reports. The court is conscious that such pressures may affect future assessments.

Equally, mental health service pressures, notably long waiting lists for community psychiatric support, have been raised in correspondence with Dr Martin Gallaway, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who was instructed to assess you and prepare a report dated 3 November 2025. Dr Gallaway’s findings are detailed below.

It is also germane to observe that the retail sector itself faces ongoing challenges. The Liverpool Retail Crime Partnership, in communications with the court, has reported elevated incidents not only of theft but also antisocial behaviour—ranging from substance misuse in public spaces to street harassment—factors which collectively degrade the shopping environment and deter legitimate commerce.

The court must pause to commend the work of the community group “ShopSafe Liverpool,” a voluntary coalition which provides victim support and education to retail staff. Their stakeholders’ letters, submitted in advance of this hearing, speak to the psychological toll of persistent retail theft on employees, some of whom have reported increased anxiety, stress, and absenteeism.

The facts of the case are as follows:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

Fragments of CCTV footage, corroborated by employee statements and store inventory reports, establish a pattern of conduct involving the acquisition of numerous low to mid-value items over an aggregate period. These items, often stolen unobserved or concealed, were reportedly later sold through informal channels or on online marketplaces.

The logistic complexity of the investigative efforts undertaken cannot be overstated. Digital forensic analysis of an aged smartphone found at your residence identified communications suggesting awareness of surveillance and deliberate efforts to circumvent security measures at various premises. The process of such data extraction was undertaken by the City Centre Digital Crime Unit over a three-month period and entailed considerable operational backlog.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

These thefts transpired without direct confrontation or physical threat, yet their cumulative impact was noted by store managers who expressed increasing concern about safety and morale. Several managers attested to implementing modified working patterns, reduced lone shifts, and installing additional security infrastructure, at material cost.

Applications to the Legal Aid Agency to instruct an independent forensic psychologist faced administrative delays of almost six weeks. Such delays, regrettably, are not uncommon and reflect systemic difficulties in securing timely expert input. The court therefore expresses its continued hope for reform in the funding and commissioning of expert services within the criminal justice framework.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

The defendant’s prior record includes multiple previous convictions for theft and shoplifting, as well as three separate community resolutions for minor acquisitive offences. The final occasion within this series of offences was shortly after an out-of-court disposal was imposed for an unrelated shop theft at the Liverpool One Marks & Spencer.

With regard to co-defendants, though none are directly implicated in the current charge, this court remains aware of a companion case involving an individual charged for fly-tipping on green belt land adjacent to the defendant’s former residence. Though unrelated here, this peripheral fact underscores the intertwining nature of local offending patterns and the burden borne by environmental enforcement teams.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

The psychological report prepared by Dr Gallaway indicates no severe mental illness but identifies traits consistent with impulsivity, poor decision-making, and emotional dysregulation possibly exacerbated by prolonged periods of social isolation. There is an absence of frank substance dependency, though intermittent misuse of alcohol was reported. Notably, you declined offers for engagement with voluntary addiction support services prior to this offence.

Dr Gallaway emphasises that the lack of engagement with community support is a significant risk factor for recidivism. The court is compelled to express its disappointment at this refusal, especially given the availability of resources cited by local charities such as “Hope Foundations” and the “Liverpool Urban Outreach Team,” which have both engaged with defendants with similar backgrounds, albeit with limited success in any guarantee of desistance.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

In terms of housing, you currently reside in temporary accommodation provided by Liverpool City Council’s homelessness services, following eviction from your previous tenancy on grounds unrelated to any criminal conduct. Correspondence from your housing officer, Ms Elaine Cooper, outlines ongoing efforts to secure more stable accommodation, a process hampered by the city’s acute shortage of social housing and an influx of applicants displaced by recent floods affecting Merseyside.

This context highlights the pressing societal challenge of street homelessness and the increasing use of temporary lodgings and hotels by Local Authorities as stopgap measures. But it remains the case that homelessness, while a critical social problem, does not excuse deliberate criminality.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

The probation report completed to date, while necessarily preliminary, expresses concerns about your low motivation to engage and limited protective factors. It recommends tailored intervention encompassing cognitive behavioural therapy focused on acquisitive offending, coupled with referrals to financial and housing advisory services.

It must be said that the probation service is severely constrained by current staffing shortages and increased administrative burden arising from multi-agency public protection arrangements. These pressures inevitably limit the immediacy and breadth of supervision that can be offered, a situation of which the court remains acutely mindful.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

In the course of evidence, the court heard submissions from representatives of the “Merseyside Retail Workers’ Union,” who provided a comprehensive account of the difficulties faced by shop staff amid rising shoplifting and a concomitant increase in staff turnover, burnout, and forced overtime. These industrial and welfare concerns, while not determinative here, provide meaningful insight into the lived impact beyond the statutory harm.

Finally, it bears noting that the defendant has, during these proceedings, submitted several handwritten letters to this court. These letters are carefully composed, articulate a degree of regret, and describe aspirations toward finding sustainable employment and maintaining sobriety. While no substitute for formal remorse, such communications inform the court’s understanding of attitude and psychological state.

Sentencing Considerations  
The offences constitute a serious breach of trust between members of the community and erode the fabric of lawful commerce. The repeated nature, apparent premeditation, and disregard for previous warnings all reflect elevated culpability.

Mitigation includes your plea of guilty, albeit late, the absence of weapons or threats, and the lack of any reported physical harm to victims. Your personal background, including housing difficulties and psychological vulnerability, may be weighed, but do not, in the court’s view, materially reduce culpability.

The court accepts the defence proposal for a community-based disposal incorporating a cognitive skills programme and financial rehabilitation support, but the sentencing decision must balance rehabilitation with the requirement to deter and protect.
