IN THE CROWN COURT AT RIVERSDALE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. RVD/2025/13177  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. F. Meredith  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence in respect of charges brought against you pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically relating to an alleged course of conduct involving thefts from various retail establishments within the jurisdiction of Riversdale and adjoining boroughs. The matters before the court reflect incidents spanning a period from mid-2023 through to early 2025.  

Procedural History and Case Progression  
You were arrested on 2 March 2025 following an extensive investigation led by the Riversdale Constabulary’s Retail Crime Unit, in partnership with the Riverside Business Crime Reduction Partnership and local proprietors. The investigation involved multi-agency collaboration including CCTV and digital forensic examination, as well as liaison with the Safer Neighbourhood Team. It is noteworthy that your apprehension followed a sequence of intelligence sharing meetings, wherein patterns of theft were first identified and later substantiated, drawing on transaction logs, security footage, and witness statements. This process is emblematic of the painstaking efforts necessary in detecting and prosecuting multiple theft incidents that may otherwise appear isolated and innocuous.  

The case was initially listed at a preliminary hearing on 17 March 2025 before this court. Your solicitor entered a not guilty plea at that stage. Following further evidence disclosure, including enhanced CCTV and forensic exhibits, you altered your plea to guilty at the plea and trial preparation hearing conducted on 25 June 2025. Credit for that late plea is noted but must be tempered by the attendant delay and its impact on court resources and affected parties.  

It is a recurring lament that in cases involving acquisitive crime, defendants are often reluctant to admit guilt until the prosecution’s evidence becomes overwhelming, as was the case here. This trend represents a regrettable inefficiency in a system already encumbered by increasing case loads and diminishing capacity — particularly within retail crime portfolios which, while personally and economically damaging, are frequently perceived as minor or “victimless” offences. Such perceptions do a disservice to victims, who include local shop employees and independent traders operating under economic duress in an increasingly competitive market.  

More directly relevant is the impact on public confidence in social order and the rule of law, which is, unavoidably, eroded when persistent thefts are allowed to continue unchecked. The court recognises the wider social dynamics implicated here but emphasizes that individual accountability must not be subordinated to sociological explanation.  

To be clear, the organization and administration of this court reflect contemporary procedural reform. The Better Case Management (BCM) programme, under which your case progressed, aims to reduce delays and duplicative hearings. While subject to a range of pressures including legal aid resourcing constraints and the availability of expert witnesses, the BCM framework nonetheless provides a constructive platform for case advancement. This case met the standard timeframes with only modest adjournments, despite the necessity for a psychiatric report and supplementary defence submissions.  

It is apt to note at this juncture that the Legal Aid Agency was, regrettably, slow to authorise funding for expert instruction until well after the scheduled dates for initial plea hearings, thereby impinging on timely case resolution. While the court appreciates the financial stewardship role the Agency plays, the procedural delays encountered here exemplify systemic inefficiencies that risk undermining the administration of justice.  

The presentation of psychiatric and risk assessments is now commonplace in these proceedings, often invoked to explain or contextualize offending behaviour. In this instance, the report from Dr Alison Reeve, consultant forensic psychologist, provided a comprehensive overview of your psychological profile, underlying vulnerabilities, and risk factors. The report was prepared with due diligence and professionalism, including face-to-face assessment sessions and collateral information from probation and family sources. Although the conclusions suggested that you do not meet diagnostic criteria for a major mental illness, traits of impulsivity and limited coping strategies were identified. The report also highlighted inconsistent engagement with available support services—a feature that the court interprets as relevant to both rehabilitation prospects and sentencing disposition.  

I also record with gratitude the written submissions of the Riversdale Victim Support Service, who provided considered observations on the impact of repeat thefts on the morale and wellbeing of retail staff. These accounts cannot be simply dismissed as ancillary; they underscore the human dimension of what might otherwise be portrayed as a mere property crime. Their contribution, alongside that of the Safer Neighbourhood Team, whose community impact statement provided further contextual detail, is acknowledged with appreciation.  

Case law guidance has been exhaustively reviewed by counsel on both sides, including but not limited to the authorities of R v. Dempsey [2020] EWCA Crim 1474, delineating the principles governing sentence reduction for guilty pleas entered at varying stages of the proceedings, and R v. Faraday [2023] EWCA Crim 581, which addresses the balance between mitigating factors and the public interest in deterrence with respect to repeated acquisitive offending. R v. Dempsey notably emphasises that the earliest realistic opportunity to plead guilty should be taken to reflect genuine remorse and an acceptance of responsibility, both of which can materially benefit sentencing. Faraday examines the threshold at which custody becomes necessary to mark community condemnation and prevent continued harm. These precedents provide crucial framework points but are not determinative in any mechanical sense.  

Equally relevant, though peripheral, is the body of jurisprudence pertaining to offences such as those seen in R v. Addington [2019] EWCA Crim 302, involving aggravated trespass and contraventions of public order legislation in suburban retail precincts. While the facts of that case diverge markedly from the present charges, the judicial commentary on the social consequences of retail area disorder remains of incidental jurisprudential import.  

It is notable that this court has recently handled matters where co-defendants engaged in aggravated burglary and affray, such as in R v. Weaver [2024] EWCA Crim 621, a case unrelated to you but illustrative of the spectrum of criminality that can arise in commercial district offences. Those judgments serve to sharpen the focus here, underscoring the relatively moderate scale of the instant offences but also reinforcing the necessity of a firm sentencing approach.  

Facts of the Offending Conduct  
The facts of the case are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

The offending involved a pattern of behaviour, often characterised by the use of distraction techniques and brief, targeted incursions into store premises. Some incidents were captured on high-definition remote CCTV, allowing clear identification and corroboration. Other evidence included receipts and stock audit discrepancies aligning with the periods of alleged theft.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Your conduct demonstrated an awareness of store layout and security placements, as well as a readiness to exploit moments when employees were occupied or absent. In some instances, staff described feelings of apprehension, prompting modified working patterns, including lock-up of particular inventory and altered shift schedules—measures designed to mitigate potential losses and enhance personal safety.

Moreover, the cumulative financial impact—while modest in per-occurrence terms—reached a threshold sufficient to cause disruption to business viability. This was particularly consequential for small independent traders reliant on slim profit margins and without the institutional resilience of larger national chains. Such economic pressures often translate directly into job insecurity for local employees and diminished community services.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

The prosecution further relies upon evidence illustrating previous interventions by community officers and local anti-crime initiatives, which you failed to engage with or heed. Past warnings and diversion efforts—to which you were subject—did not deter subsequent offending, signaling, in the court's view, a degree of culpability warranting more than nominal sanction.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

Reference should be made to the defendant’s prior criminal record, which includes convictions for shoplifting and related acquisitive offences, some of which resulted in community orders or conditional discharges. The consistency of offending behaviour over a period exceeding two years highlights the challenges encountered by enforcement and support agencies alike.  

Expert Reports and Social Context  
The report prepared by Dr Reeve elaborates upon personal factors, including socioeconomic stressors and housing instability, which are germane to the court’s consideration of risk and culpability. She noted your expressed feelings of financial precarity, unemployment, and social isolation. While these are relevant, they cannot be considered determinative in assessing blameworthiness.  

The probation service’s pre-sentence enquiry, although not yet available in full, has provided preliminary observations concerning your background, familial ties, and social connections. It is noted that you have limited engagement with support services, a factor regrettably common among individuals with similar offence profiles. This lack of engagement complicates the prospect of effective rehabilitation and necessitates careful supervisory arrangements post-sentence. I direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report detailing feasible community approaches in addition to custodial alternatives.  

A further social dimension deserving mention is the ongoing strain on local housing frameworks. Riverside Borough, like many urban areas, faces significant pressures stemming from homelessness rates, temporary accommodation shortages, and overcrowding. This places additional burdens on community support organisations and public services. These factors, while present, do not excuse criminal conduct but rather contextualise the complex environment in which such offending arises.  

Similarly, staffing shortages in probation services continue to hamper delivery of rehabilitative programmes, leading to delays in assessment and supervision that challenge the efficacy of sentence plan implementation. These system-wide issues must be borne in mind as the court contemplates appropriate sanctions and mechanisms for ongoing monitoring.  

Other Institutional and Procedural Considerations  
It is pertinent to record that the Riversdale Crown Court benefited recently from a refurbishment programme, improving accessibility and security within courtrooms 2 and 4. Court clerks and ushers have performed admirably under increased workload and scheduling pressures. Such improvements contribute modestly to the overall efficiency of criminal justice administration.  

Additionally, the defendant’s counsel, Mr Dominic Faulkner, is to be commended for his diligent submissions. Despite constraints arising from the Legal Aid Agency’s procedural delays, he has provided consistent and professional representation. Likewise, Ms Hannah Geiss representing the Crown has conducted the prosecution with commendable clarity and restraint.  

It is also observed with some regret that in cases of this nature, media interest is invariably low. Despite the open justice principle, few reporters or public observers attend proceedings involving offences perceived as low-level theft. This disconnect between the legal process and public engagement may erode confidence in transparency and accountability, a matter beyond the court’s immediate control but worthy of reflection.  

The court acknowledges the letter of support submitted by your sister, Ms Angela H, which portrays your personal circumstances and attempts to characterise your conduct as a product of hardship and sporadic mental health difficulties. While such representations are always noted with care, they do not diminish the gravity of the offences.  

Case Law Interjections  
Turning to appellate authorities, the case of R v. Greenfield [2022] EWCA Crim 1987 is instructive on the principle that repeat acquisitive offending, even at low monetary value, can warrant immediate custody when deterrence and community protection are paramount. The defendant there was found to have engaged in multiple thefts of confectionery and personal care items from supermarkets, displaying a similar modus operandi and persistence.  

In another instance, R v. Clementson [2019] EWCA Crim 1534 dealt with a series of fly-tipping offences involving waste disposal in public greenbelt areas. Despite materially different facts, the court reaffirmed that economic and environmental harms—though often indirect—bear significantly on sentencing considerations. Such principles underscore the importance the courts attach to the broad societal consequences of offending beyond narrow legal categories.  

It is also appropriate to reference R v. Lynott [2023] EWCA Crim 2398, wherein a defendant was convicted of possession of a bladed article in the vicinity of a school car park. The particular focus on the vulnerability of minors and the school environment provided an aggravating feature despite the relatively minor nature of the possession offence. This case, though distinct, exemplifies how contextual factors may augment sentence severity—an approach mirrored in the present proceedings as relates to the impact on community retail environments.  

The court further reflects upon procedural irregularities unrelated to the defendant but relevant to the court’s wider workload: a co-defendant in an unrelated magistrates’ matter was found to have assaulted arresting officers with improvised weapons during detention, necessitating reassignment of officers and temporary staffing shortages. Additionally, an interpreter’s delayed attendance at a separate Crown Court hearing postponed proceedings for several hours. The cumulative effect of such unpredictable disruptions cannot be overstated.  

While these events do not bear upon your specific culpability, they offer a sobering insight into the logistical pressures taxing the justice system contemporaneously.  

Summary of the Defendant’s Background  
You are stated to be 34 years old with a history characterised by periods of unstable employment and accommodation. Previous convictions reflect offences of dishonesty predominantly involving shoplifting and minor public order breaches. You report limited contact with family—a theme apparent in the probation assessment—and intermittent engagement with local support agencies but no sustained participation in treatment or rehabilitation programmes.  

There is no evidence suggesting gang involvement or coercion. Your defence submissions emphasise a history of financial hardship, mental health episodes including anxiety and depression, and a purported lack of positive role models. While the court neither discounts nor diminishes these factors, they are common in many individuals who nonetheless elect to live within the bounds of the law.  

Victim Impact and Community Harm  
The court has before it victim personal statements detailing the impact on shop employees who experienced increased fear, job insecurity, and emotional distress due to your crimes. Testimony included accounts of workplace stress, reduced hours, and in some instances, the shuttering of sections of stores during your visits as a temporary security measure.  

The economic consequences, though not catastrophic in scale per individual offence, accumulate to inflict genuine hardship on small business operators. This has knock-on effects relating to employment stability, local economic activity, and consumer confidence, factors this court must weigh alongside traditional sentencing considerations.  

Sentencing Framework and Considerations  
The sentencing guidelines applicable to theft offences counsel a calibrated approach, balancing culpability, harm, and personal mitigation. The court must confront the question of public protection, deterrence—both general and specific—and the defendant’s rehabilitation prospects.  

The principles set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and relevant Sentencing Council guidelines remain paramount. The court must consider the aggravating features associated with repeated, targeted offending and the absence of meaningful engagement with prior diversionary measures.  

The late guilty plea entitles you to some reduction in sentence; however, as reiterated in R v. Smith & Wesson [2021] EWCA Crim 2198, the timing and motivation for the plea influence the extent of any discount. Pleas on the cusp of trial yield lesser credit than those expressed at the earliest possible opportunity.  

The court is, regrettably, conscious of the limits of community-based interventions in your case, given your previous non-engagement and the findings of the psychological assessment. Yet, in light of sentencing principles embodying rehabilitation and proportionality, custodial options with structured supervision are considered alongside possible community orders.  

At this juncture, no definitive sentence is imposed. The court requires the full pre-sentence report to assist in identifying appropriate disposals, with particular reference to cognitive skills programmes, financial management assistance, and potential for an unpaid work requirement. Consideration should be given as well to viable mental health support pathways, albeit recognising the limitations inherent in available resources—a factor that regrettably impairs the prompt delivery of comprehensive care.  

As the sentencing hearing concludes, I record my appreciation to all professionals who have contributed to this matter. This includes the court clerk, ushers maintaining order, and court security staff whose presence facilitates proceedings in a safe and dignified manner.  

I also observe with some interest the ongoing discussions in Parliament concerning reforms to legal aid funding structures, which if realised, may lead to swifter expert assessments and thus speedier case progression—a development this court wholeheartedly supports.  

These sentencing remarks are issued on this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at Riversdale Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to sections 108 and 111 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 respectively. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply unless otherwise directed. Costs are reserved.  

Sentencing is adjourned pending receipt of a full pre-sentence report and any further representations.  

These are the orders of the court.
