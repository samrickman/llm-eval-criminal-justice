IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/15324  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. F. Branning  
Filed: 18 August 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence on a charge under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to a sustained and repeated pattern of shoplifting across multiple retail premises within the metropolitan area between October 2023 and April 2025. The offending, though individually of modest value, cumulated into a matter of considerable concern as it reflects persistent acquisitive criminality with an appreciable impact on local businesses and their employees.

Procedural Background  
Your first court appearance took place on 12 May 2025 at Manchester Magistrates’ Court, following an arrest on 8 May subsequent to a coordinated operation led by officers from the Greater Manchester Police’s Retail Crime Unit. An investigation that spanned several months involved partnership working with retail security teams, CCTV providers, and local authority licensing officers. The charge was committed to the Crown Court given its seriousness and the volume of associated underlying conduct. Your matter was listed for plea and trial preparation on 3 July 2025 but was adjourned to allow the defence to obtain expert psychiatric evidence and to secure a pre-sentence report. 

It is characteristic of cases involving prolonged retail theft that delays in preparation arise from a combination of factors. These include the necessity to collate extensive evidential material from multiple venues, the repeated need to update disclosure paperwork in response to defence enquiries, and the time-consuming process of obtaining funding authorisations from the Legal Aid Agency for psychological assessments. In this instance, there was regrettably some delay attributable to administrative difficulties within the Legal Aid framework, a matter I shall address further shortly. 

At the most recent case management hearing on 10 August, the court received confirmation that expert evidence is now available, and a pre-sentence report instruction has been issued to the Greater Manchester Probation Service. Representations have been invited from all parties ahead of today's sentencing hearing.

The prosecution is represented by Ms Emily Haines, crown counsel of noted diligence and industry in the field of acquisitive crime. The defence is represented by Mr Adam Griffith, instructed on a Legal Aid basis, who has filed a cogent mitigation bundle and succeeded in securing a psychiatric report by Dr Sheila Morton, consultant forensic psychiatrist. I record thanks to both counsel for their clear submissions in what are, invariably, complex and multi-faceted proceedings despite the relatively low transaction value of individual offences.

The Context of Retail Theft  
It is worth reflecting briefly on the broader socio-economic environment in which offences of this nature occur. The recent annual reports by the Retail Consortium consistently document a troubling upward trend in shoplifting, accentuated by the pressures wrought by the post-pandemic economic upheaval. Retail networks report a marked increase in ‘shrinkage’ — that is, the cumulative effect of theft, error, and fraud — with attendant ramifications for pricing, staffing levels, and store viability. These are not abstract harms. In Manchester alone, several longstanding small- and medium-sized retailers have been forced to close, citing theft-related losses as an operative factor. This reduction in retail infrastructure affects not only commercial profitability but also local employment and community cohesion.

Multi-agency responses seek to ameliorate this issue, often involving coordination between law enforcement, local authorities, Business Crime Reduction Partnerships, and community safety teams. Despite these efforts, resources remain strained, and the diversion of front-line officers to low-level but repetitive theft investigations, while necessary, imposes a material burden on policing priorities. The public expectation for effective deterrence and swift justice is high, and the courts must balance compassion with the imperative to uphold societal norms and public confidence.

It is pertinent to note that the delivery of justice in cases such as this is rarely straightforward. The logistical challenge of assembling volumes of digital and testimonial evidence — often from numerous vendors with varying standards of record-keeping — taxes the prosecutorial machinery. Defence practitioners too face difficulties in addressing complex disclosure and, where appropriate, securing expert opinion within tight timeframes and funding constraints. All these factors must be borne in mind as this court approaches the question of sentence.

The Offending  
The facts of the offending, as reconstructed from detailed CCTV footage, store loss prevention records, and witness statements, reveal a pattern of deliberate, targeted theft. The choice of goods suggests a familiarity with both retail environments and secondary markets. You worked predominantly alone, but your methodology involved calculated evasion of detection, including the removal of security tags and the use of concealment tactics within clothing and personal items. Multiple reports from store staff indicate a palpable sense of apprehension and reduced morale attributable to your repeated visits. Items taken ranged from toiletries to over-the-counter medicines and small electronic accessories, all of which are known for their resale value.

The offending shows careful premeditation, with surveillance footage evidencing your awareness of staff positions and shift changes. The frequency of offences also indicates a sustained commitment to this pattern over an extended timeframe. Previous diversification strategies suggested in the literature on behavioural criminology, such as temporary desistences or ostensibly legitimate shopping visits to obfuscate intent, were not evident here. The repeated return to the same premises compounded victim distress.

In judicial guidance, cases such as R v. Cromwell [2019] EWCA Crim 3245, may be instructive on the elements of persistence and impact on victims in retail theft. Though denominated as 'low-level', when repeated and targeted, such offending can justify custodial measures to serve both punishment and deterrence.

Related Case Law and Sentencing Approaches  
I pause to remark on a selection of appellate decisions which, while not directly on point in every respect, provide illuminating context. The Court of Appeal in R v. Middleton [2020] EWCA Crim 2914 upheld a sentence of eight months’ custody for repeat shoplifting involving goods valued at under £200 per incident but reflecting a clear pattern of escalation. The court observed that persistent offences, while individually minor, cumulatively erode public confidence and can precipitate serious social harm. Similarly, R v. Chappell [2022] EWCA Crim 1449 reiterated that the timeliness and sincerity of a plea are critical when considering credit for remorse.

Further afield, R v. Kavanagh [2018] EWCA Crim 2007 considered the significance of prior community order failures in the context of theft offences, underscoring the court’s power to impose custodial sanctions where rehabilitative options have been exhausted or spurned.

In sentencing for acquisitive crimes, the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guideline (2021 edition) remains the principal reference, balancing culpability, harm, and mitigation. This court will adopt that approach, calibrated for the specifics of your case.

Victim Impact and Business Consequences  
Representations have been provided by the Manchester Retail Alliance. These detail not only the monetary loss incurred but also psychological and operational consequences for staff. In several instances, employees have reported elevated anxiety, leading to increased sickness absence and requests for redeployment. Some stores have revised opening hours and reduced staffing
