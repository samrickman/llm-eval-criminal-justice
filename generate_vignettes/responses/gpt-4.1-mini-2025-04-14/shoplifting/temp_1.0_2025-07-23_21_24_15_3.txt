IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14736  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. G. FAIRCHILD  
Filed: 18 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your conviction for offences of theft executed within the retail environment over an extended interval. The charges come pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, with the offending spanning from early 2023 through to mid-2025, primarily occurring within the confines of various sales premises across Brighton and the surrounding South East commercial corridors.  

Procedural History  
Your case first entered the criminal process in January 2025 upon charge resulting from an investigation led jointly by the Sussex Constabulary and Brighton Business Crime Partnership. This partnership is a well-established collaboration designed to monitor and respond to repeated acquisitive offences against retailers. It is neither novel nor surprising that investigations of this type rely heavily on the collation of evidence from disparate sources, including store operators’ internal loss prevention teams, national databases, and liaison with local authorities responsible for community safety and crime analysis. Much effort was made to conform with the guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council regarding the handling of low-level theft offences, mindful of the fact that repetitive petty crime often requires a response calibrated to the seriousness of the harm caused to both individuals and business communities.  

The prosecution’s case was supported by numerous schedules of evidence and statements, and considerable time was devoted by the police and liaison officers to meticulous assembly and verification of CCTV material. While it is often said that technological surveillance offers an almost infallible method of apprehension, the reality is far more complex. Issues of poor image quality, variations in camera angle, and gaps in coverage introduce a degree of uncertainty. Indeed, the painstaking nature of evidence gathering in this case bespoke the strains imposed upon investigative teams subjected to escalating levels of low-level crime amid broader resource pressures.  

Earlier this year, you were interviewed under caution and initially denied involvement. The Crown, however, relied on corroborative forensic evidence—chief among it items of clothing found in your possession that matched fabric visible in surveillance footage. Such evidence was considered robust enough to proceed to trial, which was originally fixed for 12 September 2025 but subsequently adjourned following a successful defence application to obtain psychiatric assessment and a fuller pre-sentence report.  

I would, at this juncture, acknowledge the work of Ms. Harriet K. Donovan representing the Crown and Mr. Lucas Finch, instructed for the defence on Legal Aid. Although both counsel have conducted themselves with professional diligence, this court cannot refrain from noting vexation with delays instigated by bureaucratic hurdles within the Legal Aid funding apparatus. Mr Finch’s application for a clinical psychological assessment, essential to the proper understanding of the defendant’s mental and emotional profile, languished unresolved for a period extending beyond six weeks. Such delays place undue strain on proceedings and undermine the timely administration of justice, a concern already raised repeatedly in these very courts.  

It may also be worth reflecting, briefly, on the broader institutional context in which such cases unfold. The Sussex Probation Service, charged with preparing the necessary pre-sentence reports and managing offender rehabilitation, continues to experience significant increases in caseload alongside reductions in staff complement. Reports indicate an average waiting time for attendance upon probation officers extending beyond six weeks, complicating the preparation of up-to-date assessments and interventions. Despite these challenges, the probation service remains resilient and committed to contributing meaningfully to the pursuit of public protection and offender reintegration.  

It is notable that the case progression, under the oversight of the Crown Court’s listing officers and utilizing the Better Case Management framework, proceeded with reasonable dispatch. The BCM initiative, now well-established, serves to streamline the judicial process and reduce adjournments, fostering clarity over evidential stance and encouraging early resolution. It is the court’s observation that in this matter, both prosecution and defence counsel demonstrated adequate cooperation consistent with the aims of prompt case management, notwithstanding the unfortunate delays occasioned by external factors.  

The broader societal environment in which offences of this nature occur cannot be ignored. Years of underinvestment in social housing, increases in street homelessness, and rising food insecurity exert palpable pressures on individuals at the margins, often precipitating conduct that culminates in engagement with the criminal justice system. Nonetheless, the courts remain vigilant in ensuring that such factors explain but do not excuse conduct that violates the peace and order of our communities.  

Legal Context  
The Theft Act 1968 remains the primary statutory instrument governing dishonesty offences such as those with which you stand convicted. The statute’s broad provisions have been interpreted and elaborated upon through significant case law, underscoring that theft is a crime of dishonesty involving the appropriation of property with intent to permanently deprive the lawful owner. Notwithstanding the seemingly minor monetary value of individual items stolen in shoplifting cases, the law rightly recognises that repeated patterns of offending have cumulative effects that erode trust and impose economic and psychological harm beyond the immediate material loss.  

The Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences establishes a framework that takes into account the value of items stolen, the number of incidents, the degree of planning or sophistication, the offender’s culpability, and the impact upon victims. Aggravating factors include repeat offending despite prior warnings, targeting vulnerable premises such as small independent retailers or community pharmacies, the use of distraction techniques, or efforts to remove security devices. Mitigating considerations typically involve early guilty pleas, demonstration of remorse, contextual hardships, or demonstrably effective engagement with rehabilitative services.  

In R v. Fenwick [2023] EWCA Crim 842, the Court of Appeal reaffirmed that sustained acquisitive offending merits a proportionate response that places weight on the cumulative harm caused to commercial premises and local economies, especially where there is clear evidence of premeditation and a failure to desist following warning or previous sanctions. The decision indicated that sentences should both punish and disrupt offending patterns, while encouraging rehabilitation through structured interventions. Although Fenwick concerned a more complex commercial fraud, its principles are instructive in interpreting the sentencing approach to repeat retail theft.  

Other jurisprudential touchstones include R v. Tremble [2022] EWCA Crim 1297, where the Court emphasised that the psychological impact upon retail staff, including anxiety and reduced sense of safety in the workplace, is a legitimate consideration in assessing harm. The presiding judge in Tremble remarked on the unsettling effect of persistent shoplifting on vulnerable or lone workers, thus highlighting the non-economic harms frequently obscured by a sole focus on monetary value. These judgments underscore the evolving recognition within the courts of the multifaceted effects of acquisitive crime at the street level.  

Contrast may be drawn with R v. Calloway [2015] EWCA Crim 42, a case involving fly-tipping on protected greenbelt land, which, although not related to theft, explored themes of public and environmental harm arising from unlawful conduct. Calloway serves as a peripheral illustration that breaches of law—whether destructive or acquisitive—share a common underpinning damage to the community fabric.  

Facts of the Offending  
The facts of your offending are summarised thus:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

The evidence shows a consistent modus operandi characterised by deliberate selection of high-demand items, frequent visits to multiple premises, and the employment of distraction strategies. On occasion, you were recorded removing security tags with improvised tools and absconding with goods concealed beneath clothing or in carrier bags.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Such behaviour evinces a degree of calculated intent rather than impulsive lapse. Surveillance footage from one store depicts your presence during a shift changeover, suggesting timing your actions to coincide with staff distractions. The court notes that while the items themselves may be of modest individual value, the cumulative effect on the affected businesses is quantifiable and extends to increased insurance premiums, reduced worker morale, and interruption to trade.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

Statements from retail employees indicate a palpable sense of unease. One pharmacy assistant disclosed increasing anxiety about lone working and an expressed desire to alter shift patterns to avoid encounters with you. Such evidence corroborates findings in recent sentencing guidance emphasising psychological and workplace impacts attendant upon shop theft.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

The victim impact statements tendered through the victim liaison officer articulate the toll on owners and employees alike. These include reference to the imposition of additional security measures—costly and intrusive—and the curtailment of customer-facing services. While there is no suggestion of physical altercation or threat, the sustained presence of a repeated offender serves to destabilise a sense of safety fundamental to communal commercial spaces.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Despite previous community resolutions and cautions, you resumed offending shortly after each intervention. This pattern indicates a failure to respond meaningfully to non-custodial deterrents.

Expert and Risk Assessments  
The court gratefully acknowledges the contribution of Dr Selina Cheng, consultant forensic psychologist, whose report was grounded on clinical interviews, cognitive testing, and a review of your records. While Dr Cheng found no evidence of major mental illness, she noted traits including impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and signs of mild dependence on prescribed substances. Your self-reported history indicates episodic employment instability, periodic housing insecurity, and intermittent engagement with social services.  

Dr Cheng’s opinion was cautious but unambiguous: the absence of significant psychiatric disorder does not obviate the identification of criminogenic factors which, if left unaddressed, predispose to ongoing offending. She recommended participation in a structured cognitive behavioural therapy programme addressing impulse control, alongside practical support for housing and employment.  

It must be recorded with some concern that the aforesaid recommendations, offered with a view to facilitating both rehabilitation and public protection, have been met with inconsistent engagement at best. As has been observed by the Probation Service in its pre-sentence report, your cooperation with voluntary sector agencies, budgeting advice clinics, and employment support schemes has been sporadic and largely reactive. The court is conscious that such services operate under acute strain, and that their capacity to extend meaningful aid to those who do not actively participate is severely constrained.  

You are now aged 33. Your antecedents include five previous convictions, primarily for shoplifting and related acquisitive offences. The most recent prior conviction led to a conditional discharge, yet you reoffended within months. No evidence of organised criminal association or coercion has emerged in this case. Your reported family circumstances are fractured, and you currently reside in temporary accommodation provided by the local council. The court recognises the wider social challenges implicit in such instability, but also the imperative that such difficulties are not used to justify repeated criminal behaviour.  

It is worth noting, tangentially, that the defendant’s younger brother is currently subject to separate criminal proceedings for an entirely unrelated matter involving allegations of benefit fraud. Although these proceedings have no bearing on the case before the court, such references often arise and merit careful distinction between co-implicating parties and independent actors.  

In addition, it is regrettable that staff from the Probation Service covering this locality have also been affected by recent police investigations into corrupt conduct by a former probation officer. While unrelated to this matter and indeed to you personally, the ripple effects of such incidents within public services cannot be overlooked. They contribute to a climate of uncertainty and morale challenges within agencies otherwise engaged in the vital work of community supervision.  

Sentencing Considerations  
The offences before the court constitute a sustained pattern of offending marked by persistence, a degree of planning, and disregard for earlier attempts at diversion or informal resolution. The impact extends beyond pure financial loss to encompass adverse effects on victims’ psychological welfare and broader community confidence in public safety.  

While the late guilty plea is acknowledged, this factor does not wholly mitigate the seriousness of your offending. As outlined in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, a case involving unrelated serious arson with grave consequences, the timing of any plea must be appraised contextually to ascertain if it genuinely reflects remorse or instead arises from tactical realisation of overwhelming evidence. Here, the plea entered at a late stage suggests the latter risk cannot be wholly discounted.  

The court also acknowledges your personal difficulties, including housing insecurity and financial strain. Nonetheless, such adversities are, regrettably, pervasive and affect many who do not resort to criminal conduct. The courts are required to balance empathy with accountability, and to avoid unwarranted indulgence.  

The current sentencing guidelines, which have been updated in June 2025 to incorporate reflections on the psychological impact of retail theft on staff, have been carefully considered. The court is mindful of the overarching principles of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public.  

In preparation for sentencing, a detailed pre-sentence report has been requested, with specific instructions to explore the availability and suitability of tailored community interventions, including cognitive behavioural programmes, financial advice, and accommodation support. The probation service is also invited to assess the feasibility of unpaid work and restorative justice options, aimed at securing both reparation and reintegration.  

The court is alert to the continuing challenge posed by the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative processes, which have contributed to delay at multiple junctures in this case. It is hoped that this matter may serve as a reminder of the need for reform and efficiency to prevent prejudices against the defendant’s right to timely and effective representation.  

Similarly, while the court received representations from the Brighton Business Improvement District and local community safety teams regarding the cumulative impact of low-level acquisitive crime on economic vitality and neighbourhood cohesion, it must formally record the dedication of front-line staff operating under increasingly adverse conditions. Their efforts, although often unacknowledged, are crucial to maintaining the fabric of civic life.  

The court also notes tangentially that one co-defendant in a separate matter pending before the same Crown Court had, before absconding, been charged with affray during a dispute in a local public house involving pool cues and bottles. This case holds no relevance to your conduct or culpability but illustrates the complexities of concurrent proceedings in busy jurisdictions.  

By way of further background, it is observed that an adjacent case involving charges of criminal damage to a parish church noticeboard was heard last month. Such offences, while distinct from theft, similarly demonstrate the challenges faced by community policing efforts in managing diverse low-level criminality.  

In light of all matters, this court will adjourn to allow the delivery of the probation assessment and to enable full consideration of any submissions arising therefrom. Upon receipt of the report and any further representations, sentence will be passed in open court with notice to all parties.  

These sentencing remarks are given on this day, 18 October 2025, in Court 6 of the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal against conviction or sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are in place. Costs are reserved for separate determination.  

These are the orders of the court.
