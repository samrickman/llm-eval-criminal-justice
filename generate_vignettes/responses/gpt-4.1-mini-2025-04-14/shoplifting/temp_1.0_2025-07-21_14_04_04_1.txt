IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/15637  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. K. Farnsworth  
Filed: 16 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear today before this court for sentence following your guilty plea to an offence of theft, specifically a series of acts of shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct occurred over a period extending approximately from early 2024 to March 2025 and was focussed around retail premises within the Greater Manchester metropolitan area, including both chain supermarkets and independent smaller outlets.

Procedural Background and Case Management  
The initial charge was brought against you following an extensive police investigation, which was instigated after multiple reports from local businesses indicated a pattern of persistent theft-related losses. This pattern sparked action on the part of the Greater Manchester Retail Crime Partnership, an initiative which, although ostensibly designed to facilitate cooperation between law enforcement and commercial stakeholders, has been subject to ongoing critiques regarding its effectiveness and operational sustainability. It is a pertinent observation that despite the stated aims of such Partnerships, resource limitations and administrative overload frequently hinder the prompt identification and management of offenders. That said, the coordination in this particular instance was sufficiently coherent to support an early arrest and charge.

You were arrested on 12 March 2025. The investigation preceding your arrest employed a blend of conventional police work and modern technological tools. Most notably, the use of CCTV footage played a significant investigative role, along with witness statements obtained from retail staff and managers. The analysis and collation of this evidence was notable for the considerable time and effort expended, a factor not uncommon in cases where the offences involve low-value goods cumulatively amounting to a noteworthy financial impact.

I record with some disquiet that proceedings have been disrupted on no fewer than three occasions due to administrative delays, including adjournments occasioned by necessary applications for additional disclosure and the securing of Legal Aid funding for psychiatric evaluation. Such deferments test the patience not only of the court and prosecution but also of the community stakeholders whose concerns underpin the seriousness with which this court approaches persistent acquisitive offending.

The Better Case Management system, aimed at expediting and streamlining case progression, was engaged once proceedings reached the Crown Court. I note the cooperation of counsel on both sides in ensuring the hearing timetables were observed, notwithstanding the delays noted. On 15 September 2025, you entered a plea of guilty to the single representative charge following your previous not guilty plea at the initial hearings. It is welcome, albeit belated, that you have accepted responsibility for the offending conduct alleged.

I acknowledge the submissions made by Miss Fiona Leigh for the Crown, who presented a thorough outline of the impact on local retailers and the wider community, supported by statements from victims. I also note the diligent advocacy of Mr Gareth Milne, representing you under a full Legal Aid order. Mr Milne made extensive representations concerning your personal background, challenging circumstances, and potential for rehabilitation. The court is grateful for their professionalism in a case which, though not involving complex points of law, raised difficult questions of public protection and offender management in the increasingly pressured environment of retail crime enforcement.

It is necessary at this juncture to reflect upon the socio-economic context within which offending of this nature commonly arises. The present era is characterised by significant strains on social welfare systems, depleting goodwill towards punitive responses, and a growing sense of disenfranchisement amongst sections of the population. These factors are relevant insofar as they affect the motivational frameworks and rehabilitative prospects of individuals who find themselves ensnared in cycles of acquisitive offending. However, the court must balance such social considerations squarely against the imperative to deter unlawful conduct, protect vulnerable commercial enterprises, and uphold the rule of law.

It would be remiss not to observe that offences of this classification, while perhaps seen by some as ‘trifling’ or ‘victimless’, cumulatively impose both economic and psychological costs on shopkeepers, their employees, and customers. Shop workers have, in multiple documented cases, reported heightened anxiety, reduced job satisfaction, and concerns for their personal safety. Third-party effects include increased prices, reduced opening hours, and community malaise.

Subsidiary legal issues were raised during pre-trial hearings concerning the admissibility of certain forensic evidence, notably the extraction and analysis of mobile device location data. These challenges were resolved in accordance with established jurisprudence. The court had regard, in particular, to the judgments in R v. Byrne [2019] EWCA Crim 506 and the subsequent refinement of evidential standards in the context of digital surveillance and privacy protections, as set out in R v. Singhal [2021] EWCA Crim 887. In neither case was the evidence challenged successfully, and the rulings affirmed the permissibility of warrants authorising targeted data acquisition where probable cause is established.

It is well known that the Criminal Justice System has, for some years, wrestled with effectively calibrating responses to offences situated at the interface of minor acquisitive crime and underlying socio-economic vulnerability. The role of rehabilitative interventions, including community sentences supplemented by cognitive behavioural elements, remains central. Nevertheless, in appropriate circumstances where deterrence must be given considerable weight — particularly where the offending demonstrates persistence despite prior warnings — custodial options must be retained and exercised judiciously.

The courts have been guided by the Sentencing Council’s Theft Definitive Guideline (2022), which superseded previous iterations and emphasises a tiered approach according to culpability and harm. It is noted that your offending engaged multiple aggravating factors: continuity of conduct, the use of methods to evade detection, and the impact on vulnerable or small-scale businesses.

In this vein, the court has also had regard to the discretion afforded by the Court of Appeal in cases such as R v. Chambers [2023] EWCA Crim 1124, which addressed comparable patterns of stealth theft from mixed retail premises, affirming that a robust response is warranted in the face of repeated and deliberate breaches of trust and legal norm.

Alongside this legal framework, I have examined the reports tendered by the probation service, notably the pre-sentence assessment undertaken by Ms. Joanne Ellis dated 1 October 2025. This document provides valuable insight into your history, personal circumstances, and recidivism risk.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

Miss Ellis prudently observed the challenges presented by your unstable housing situation and intermittent employment, as well as your inconsistent engagement with support programmes. She offered measured recommendations including referral to a Structured Offender Intervention Programme with an emphasis on impulse control and financial responsibility. The suggestion of a mental health assessment was also proposed, citing concerns raised by your defence counsel regarding episodes of anxiety and depressive symptoms albeit in the absence of formal diagnosis.

In relation to mental health matters, it is relevant that prior reports from local NHS services indicate a history of low mood and stress-related conditions. Despite this, there is no current identification of serious mental illness or disorder that would materially diminish responsibility for the offences. The court takes this into account as a mitigating factor insofar as it may bear on your personal circumstances.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

The wider picture of public protection here is complicated by the realities of resource constraints affecting police, social services, and the probation system alike. The profiling of low-level acquisitive offenders indicates a disproportionate demand on intervention capacities, with many clients needing integrated support across multiple domains including substance misuse, employment, and mental health.

On a related note, consideration has been given to the Business Crime Reduction Initiative (BCRI), which exemplifies a newer approach to managing retail crime through data sharing and targeted prevention. Though the BCRI has had mixed success, the court acknowledges local evidence suggesting that, in this instance, it facilitated timely identification and management of your offending pattern.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

It is perhaps pertinent to mention that the retail premises affected expressed mixed responses. While some requested formal restorative justice processes, others were content for the courts to handle the matter through traditional sentencing channels. This variation reflects the diverse interests and expectations of victim communities in cases of shop theft.

Addressing the psychological dimension, expert psychiatrist Dr. Farah Khan provided a report dated 6 September 2025, detailing your clinical profile. Dr. Khan made careful note of your social anxiety and mild depressive features, but emphasised that they do not substantially impair judgement or culpability. The report suggested that engagement with therapeutic services might serve to reduce reoffending risk, but cautioned that motivation and compliance would be essential components.

Moreover, the presence of a previous community disposal in 2023 was considered consequentially relevant. You had been subject then to a conditional discharge following an earlier episode of similar offending conduct. The fact that you reverted to criminal acts within a relatively brief interval weighs heavily in the assessment of culpability and public risk. Courts have long recognised, as underscored in R v. Tiller [2020] EWCA Crim 931, the importance of demonstrating that rehabilitative efforts have had reasonable opportunity to take effect.

In the course of this case, the court has been made aware of disparate matters not directly linked to your conduct but relevant insofar as they shape perceptions and procedural practice. For example, one of your former flatmates was arrested for possession with intent to supply cannabis in an unrelated district in 2024, an incident which had no bearing on this case but was probed during the police enquiries due to proximity of residence. That such incidental associations can confound investigations is a reflection of how closely crowded environments and overlapping social networks complicate the administration of justice.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

It has also been reported that the landlord of your previous accommodation received a noise abatement notice last year. While irrelevant to your offending, this ancillary information was considered in relation to your living circumstances.

In ensuring a proportionate and just sentence, this court is also mindful of the significant staffing pressures encountered by community probation officers. Caseloads have ballooned, supervision resources have been stretched thin, and reactive demands frequently supersede planned intervention sessions. This reality creates an unfortunate tension between idealised rehabilitative aspirations and practical implementation.

Acknowledgement must also be made of the strain under which local NHS mental health services operate. Waiting lists for psychological therapies have lengthened dramatically in recent years, and the availability of specialist input for offenders remains limited.

There is, regrettably, a burgeoning fashion for late entry of guilty pleas in cases involving repeated acquisitive offences. This pattern is noted with regret by the court. Credit for such pleas cannot, and will not, be as generous where the plea is given only after the preparation of the prosecution case and the exhaustion of contestation. It must be recorded that you entered your plea at a stage where overwhelming evidence was already in place.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

The court also observes that the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of authorisation for expert reports and specialist opinion has been more labyrinthine than is acceptable. This matter delayed preparation and contributed to the adjournment of sentencing hearings. Such procedural friction undermines the efficient provision of justice, adversely affecting all parties.

Finally, the court must place on record its appreciation of those frontline retail workers who have prepared victim impact statements. These testimonials provide powerful testimony to the human consequences of what might otherwise be dismissed as abstract offences. The economic loss, the emotional impact, and the disruptions to daily life are not to be trivialised.

I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the steadfastness of the Manchester Business Crime Liaison Unit and other voluntary sector organisations that seek to ameliorate the effects of acquisitive crime upon communities.

Sentencing Outlook and Directions  
This court has endeavoured to balance the several factors confronting it: the need for punishment, the interests of rehabilitation, the consequences for victims, and the broader public interest. The findings of persistence and deliberate concealment weigh heavily in favour of a custodial or stringent community order. Counterbalancing that are your personal circumstances, health considerations, and expressions of remorse.

Given the complexity of factors, and the potential for targeted interventions to reduce reoffending, the court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report incorporating risk and needs assessment, suitable rehabilitation proposals, and an evaluation of available support services.

These sentencing remarks are issued on this 16th day of October 2025 in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. The record of proceedings is maintained in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are hereby informed of your statutory right to appeal within 28 days
