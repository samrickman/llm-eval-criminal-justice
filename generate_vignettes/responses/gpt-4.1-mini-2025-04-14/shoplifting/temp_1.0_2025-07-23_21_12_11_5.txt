IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. M2025/12645  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. S. Wentworth  
Filed: 11 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a representative charge of theft from retail premises contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, as the court has been presented with, spanned a substantial period from November 2023 through May 2025 and involved multiple shops within the Greater Manchester area, notably concentrated in the districts of Hulme, Moss Side, and Salford Quays. This court is acutely conscious, as it must be, that while each individual incident may, in isolation, have been viewed as minor, the aggregate effect constitutes a serious course of criminal conduct warranting proportionate sanction.

Procedural History and Case Management  
The proceedings have been managed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules applicable at the time, particularly the regime of Better Case Management (BCM) which seeks to optimize case progression and reduce delay. The charge was served upon you following a detailed investigation undertaken by the Greater Manchester Retail Crime Task Force supported by local Business Crime Reduction Partnerships, culminating in your formal arrest on 17 June 2025. The investigation entailed extensive collation of CCTV footage, witness statements from retail staff, and forensic examination of items seized during your detention.  

Initial hearings took place promptly, with the first appearance scheduled at the Manchester Magistrates’ Court on 26 June 2025. On that occasion, bail was granted with conditions including reporting to a local police station and observing a curfew. The Magistrates’ Court exercised its jurisdiction to allocate the matter to this Crown Court given the multiplicity and seriousness of allegations. Following that allocation, a plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 21 August 2025, at which you entered a plea of not guilty. Subsequent disclosure by the Crown included voluminous evidential material—exceeding 350 pages—comprising digital evidence and detailed witness accounts. After further review and the filing of defence statements, you entered a guilty plea at a re-listing hearing on 4 September 2025, close to the scheduled trial date.  

It is pertinent to observe that delays in the matter were, to a degree, occasioned by administrative interference from the Legal Aid Agency. An application to instruct an expert forensic psychologist was protracted over several weeks, impeding early psychiatric evaluation. These procedural hurdles, while regrettable, are not uncommon and reflect broader systemic strains on public legal funding mechanisms. Further, the court acknowledges the efforts of both prosecution and defence counsel—Ms Victoria Ling and Mr Stephen McCarthy, respectively—in navigating a complex evidential field with commendable professionalism amidst constrained resources. The court also records with regret that agency staffing shortages, notably within the Greater Manchester Probation Service, have delayed the compilation of a pre-sentence report thus far, a document which remains essential for informed sentencing.  

Contextual Observations on Retail Crime  
The judiciary continues to witness an alarming persistence of retail theft offences in metropolitan centres such as Manchester. Despite the non-violent framing of such offences, the cumulative social and economic toll cannot be understated. Businesses report not only direct financial losses but also diminution of staff morale and an erosion of customer confidence. The ripple effects are particularly pronounced in independent and small-to-medium enterprises, where margins are thin and security systems less comprehensive than in large chains.  

Retail crime partnerships, exemplified by the Greater Manchester Business Crime Reduction Board, have sought to introduce multi-agency collaboration frameworks intended to reduce shoplifting by sharing intelligence, coordinating offender management, and delivering targeted crime prevention. While these initiatives have enjoyed sporadic successes, the enduring frequency of repeat offences highlights persistent challenges in resource deployment, data sharing, and frontline enforcement capacity. The court commends, however, their tenacity and principled commitment even in the face of overstretched budgets and heightened reporting demands.  

It is within this wider milieu that the instant offences must be situated. Not in isolation, but as part of a broader societal dynamic marked by the normalization of acquisitive offences by some sectors of society. The court is reminded of the observations expressed in R v. Pennell [2019] EWCA Crim 1254, which underscored how repeated shoplifting, while seemingly minor, can aggregate into patterns of harm with disproportionate consequences for community cohesion and institutional trust. The courts must navigate carefully between recognising the human circumstances of offenders and upholding the rule of law with appropriate severity.  

Legal Framework and Case Law  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intent to permanently deprive. The sentencing guideline promulgated by the Sentencing Council in 2022 directs courts to evaluate not merely the quantum of loss but the persistence, planning, and impact on victims and wider community. Aggravating factors include repeat offending, targeting of vulnerable premises, and effects on staff welfare.

In this connection, the court notes the authoritative guidance in R v. Sanderson [2020] EWCA Crim 345, where the Court of Appeal affirmed that offences involving systematic exploitation of retail systems, including use of distraction and concealment techniques, justify custodial sentences even where items stolen are of relatively low individual value.

Further, the Court is mindful of R v. Thompson [2021] EWCA Crim 910, which involved thefts from multiple pharmacy outlets wherein the defendant’s conduct imposed severe distress on employees who feared for their safety. The judgement emphasised the need for deterrence and denounced what it termed “calculated indifference to human consequences.”

Additionally, the outworking of late guilty pleas in such offences is critically relevant. The Court reiterates the principles established in R v. Cornwall [2023] EWCA Crim 702, particularly the reduction in sentence credit afforded when pleas are entered only after detailed prosecution preparation and near trial commencement. While acknowledging your change of plea, the timing here does not justify full mitigating credit.

I also take brief note of R v. Gilbert [2018] EWCA Crim 153, concerning drug importation and conspiracy, which, while unrelated, serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of conflating offences or inflating culpability via association. The instant matter is narrowly focused on retail theft and no evidential nexus exists linking you to any commercial drug supply networks or organised crime groups.

As to the factual narrative, extensive analysis of the recorded evidence portrays a defendant exhibiting deliberate tactics: entry into shops during high footfall periods, use of concealed bags or clothing layers, manipulation of staff attention through feigned inquiries or mobile phone conversations, and systematic targeting of high-demand goods such as fragrances, over-the-counter medicine, and personal care products. These strategies evince a degree of sophistication inconsistent with impulsive or opportunistic larceny.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The court is cognisant that, despite the absence of direct violence, this pattern imposes an ongoing psychological burden on shop employees, who report heightened stress, diminished sense of safety, and in some cases — notably at one pharmacy in Salford Quays — altered shift patterns to avoid lone working.

These indirect but potent consequences of persistent theft do not diminish the seriousness of the conduct. Victim impact statements provided by store managers elucidate the erosion of confidence felt by frontline staff and the existential anxieties induced by repeated encounters with offenders. A small convenience outlet is not merely a venue for exchange but a community locus; its degradation impacts collective wellbeing.  

It is worth recalling the case of R v. Melling [2017] EWCA Crim 2841, where the defendant was convicted of burglary following a break-in at a dwelling during the occupants’ holiday absence. Although inapposite in respect of factual matrix, the appellate reasoning about harm to the sense of security has relevance here by analogy. The psychological dimension of property crime, particularly repeated and targeted, remains a central sentencing consideration.

In the present instance, the Crown relies on an evidential tapestry underpinned by technical surveillance and witness testimony which was compelling. You were positively identified through multiple CCTV captures, and notably, a forensic fibre analysis linked fibres from items found in your possession to those stolen during various incidents. While your correspondence to the court exhibited some expressed regret, the delayed plea and prior denials weigh against greater leniency.

Reports and Assessments  
Dr Sarah Benson, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, undertook an independent evaluation at the request of the defence, conducted at the Central Manchester Forensic Clinic in July 2025. Her report, dated 25 August 2025, was provided to the court and counsel in advance of today’s hearing. Dr Benson found that while you do not meet criteria for major mental disorder, there is evidence of personality traits consistent with impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. No psychotic symptoms or cognitive incapacities were detected. Substance misuse issues—principally episodic alcohol dependence—were noted, albeit without clear recent escalation.  

Unfortunately, the report observed a lack of sustained engagement with support services, a factor which diminishes prospects for immediate rehabilitation. Dr Benson recommended consideration of structured community interventions emphasising cognitive behavioural therapy targeting impulsivity and financial management skills. The report cautions, however, that compliance may be variable absent compulsory supervision.  

The court is aware of similar challenges presented by other offenders attempting to navigate an overburdened social support network. Waiting lists for mental health interventions in Manchester, particularly for community-based programmes, have extended significantly in recent years due to resource constraints exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and recent staff attrition. It is regrettable that the system struggles to meet demand and that defendants find limited avenues of assistance. Nevertheless, the willingness and aptitude to seek help remain paramount and cannot be supplanted by claims of systemic failure alone.  

Separately, a pre-sentence report from the Probation Service has yet to be completed due to staff shortages but is expected imminently. Given the accumulated delays, the court today must proceed with preliminary sentencing remarks, reserving final determination until full consideration of that report.  

Additional Procedural and Contextual Matters  
The court notes with sorrow that this case, like many, has absorbed considerable public resources, from police investigations through to judicial time. The extended nature of the inquiry reflects not only the complexity of assembling evidence but also the ongoing strain on criminal justice agencies from rising levels of acquisitive crime. It is notable that in the period since 2020, Greater Manchester Police have reported a 15% increase in theft-related calls, taxing investigative and analytical capacities. Further, this case coincided with intermittent industrial action affecting court listing availability, causing some adjournments and rescheduling.  

The legal aid difficulties encountered by defence counsel in engaging expert witnesses are emblematic of wider systemic challenges. Similar administrative delays have been observed in other circuit courts, as noted in the 2024 Annual Report of the Criminal Bar Association, which highlighted procedural bottlenecks impeding timely expert instruction—a matter of concern for justice delivery.  

The court also acknowledges the voluntary sector contributions, including those of the Manchester Retailers' Support Network, which has engaged with victim businesses to provide counselling and security advice. Their material assistance underscores the vital role non-governmental organisations play in victim support beyond the reach of statutory provision.  

The sentence to be passed must, therefore, navigate the competing demands of punishment, deterrence, public protection, and rehabilitation. While personal circumstances may mitigate, the principle of accountability remains central, particularly in offences reflecting sustained disregard for legal and communal norms.  

The court has also noted correspondence submitted on your behalf by your sister, Ms Bernice H., dated 27 August 2025, which paints a portrait of a fractured family background and references periods of instability in early adulthood. While such facts are sympathetic, they must be weighed alongside your adult choices and responsibility. Similar letters from local charities outline your sporadic engagement with outreach services but also suggest a need for more consistent involvement. The court respects these points but emphasises that support frameworks, however comprehensive, require active participation.  

In considering sentence, it is also germane to mention that the defendant’s current accommodation is a temporary hostel placement managed by the Manchester Housing Association. This organisation, while providing essential emergency shelter, faces acute demand pressures, with instances of overcrowding and frequent transfers undermining stability. Nationally, the housing sector has recorded a 12% rise in rough sleeping and provisional estimates suggest an increase in associated criminal justice system contact. Nonetheless, the court must stress that insecurity of tenure or housing status does not provide immunity from criminal sanction but rather contextualises risk.  

The court reminds all that community orders incorporating rehabilitation requirements have demonstrated efficacy in reducing recidivism among lower-level offenders, as documented by the Ministry of Justice’s 2021 Reoffending Analysis. However, such interventions depend on both resource availability and offender compliance.  

Finally, the court acknowledges remarks made during sentencing hearings earlier this year by His Honour Judge R. L. Johnson in R v. Simmons [2025] MCR 431, recording that persistent acquisitive offending cannot be viewed, even sympathetically, as victimless crime. The subtle but profound harm caused to those earning livelihoods in retail sectors must be recognised, as must the broader implications for social cohesion and trust in rule of law.  

There is a well-established principle in sentencing practice that the imposition of credit for guilty plea is commensurate with the stage at which that plea is entered and the degree of assistance thereby afforded to the prosecution and prosecution witnesses. Your entry of plea on 4 September 2025, notably proximate to the trial date originally listed for 15 September 2025, limits the extent of discount that can be justly applied. The precedent in R v. Fairclough [2023] MCR 209 delineates a spectrum of plea discounts with reduced mitigatory effect where pleas are belated, designed to avoid trial rather than reflecting clear contrition.  

The court further observes that while no evidence of aggravating conduct such as violence, threats, or use of weaponry arose in your case, the sustained and methodical nature of offending remains a significant aggravating consideration.  

In summary, sentencing must balance the following factors: the calculated planning and regularity of offending; the psychological impact on victims; the late plea; your personal history and psychiatric assessment; and the systemic constraints faced by support and probation services.  

Before concluding, the court must refer to case law that, while tangential, offers guidance on related matters of risk and sentencing framework. In R v. Halsey [2021] EWCA Crim 838, the Court considered the interplay between mental health underpinning and the appropriateness of custodial sentencing where offences were non-violent but persistent. The appellate court indicated community sentences with mandated treatment often provide a viable balance, contingent on practitioner capacity and offender engagement. No direct parallel exists here, but the decision remains germane in emphasising the importance of rehabilitative opportunity.  

Similarly, R v. Grayson [2020] EWCA Crim 1097 involved a defendant who pleaded guilty to affray following a pub altercation involving pool cues. Though unrelated in offence type, the case is instructive for its examination of plea credit and impact on victim confidence—facets not wholly absent in the present matter.  

The court also notes, though not as relevant, the decision in R v. Edmonds [2019] EWCA Crim 1291 concerning possession of a bladed article in a school car park. The heightened culpability reflected in that case contrasts with the more calculated but non-violent conduct currently before the court.  

It is worth recording that one co-defendant previously linked to a related investigation into a series of aggravated burglaries involving theft of copper cabling from a rail depot migration was not connected to the offences for which you are now sentenced. Another accused, subject to separate proceedings for criminal damage to a church noticeboard, also bears no relevance here. These distinctions, while procedural, affirm the necessity of careful evidential differentiation.  

This court recognizes the contributions of court staff and administrative personnel who have ensured the orderly conduct of these proceedings despite occasional delays in interpreter services and the late arrival of the court clerk on 3 September 2025. Such logistical challenges, while ultimately minor, represent ongoing pressures facing our justice institutions.  

The sentencing hearing today has proceeded in open court, with all parties properly represented. I thank Ms Victoria Ling for the Crown and Mr Stephen McCarthy for the defence. I also wish to acknowledge Mr Colin Rimmer, probation officer assigned to this case, for his preliminary reports and cooperation despite current workforce shortages.  

Having considered all the above, I defer final sentencing pending receipt and scrutiny of the full pre-sentence report, which I anticipate shortly. The probation service is directed to explore the viability of a community order incorporating a rehabilitation activity requirement; participation in a Cognitive Skills Programme; and, if endorsed, a requirement to undertake unpaid work where practicable and appropriate. The report should further address risk assessment, personal circumstances including housing stability, any substance dependency issues, and engagement with local support networks.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 11 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities. The defendant is advised of the statutory right to appeal within 28 days as governed by the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 applicable in this matter. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
