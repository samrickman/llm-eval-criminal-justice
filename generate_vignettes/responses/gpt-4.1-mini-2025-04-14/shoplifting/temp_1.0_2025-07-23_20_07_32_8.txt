IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14897  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. M. Farnsworth  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing in relation to a charge under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically regarding shoplifting offences occurring over a sustained period in various retail premises across South Bristol and neighbouring local authority areas. This matter has been allocated to the Crown Court in accordance with the Better Case Management procedures, which aim to ensure timely and fair administration of justice, particularly in cases involving repeated acquisitive offending. The offences are alleged to have taken place between late 2023 and early 2025 and involve the repeated removal of goods from premises operated principally by small and medium-sized businesses.

Before proceeding to the factual context and sentencing considerations specific to you, the court deems it necessary to record certain procedural matters and contextual background so as to situate these remarks within the broader institutional framework in which your case has been heard. The need for extensive engagement with various legal aid authorities, specialist reports, and multiagency liaison has contributed to a protracted timeline, which is regrettable but not unusual in matters involving repeated offending with claimed underlying vulnerabilities.  

The Legal Aid Agency’s involvement raised administrative complexities, notably a delayed approval for expert psychiatric evaluation undertaken at the defendant’s behest, authorized only after multiple submissions over a period exceeding six weeks. This delay is regrettable, particularly given the impact upon the timely progression of the case but is reflective of recurring systemic challenges in securing funding for forensic and clinical assessments in acquisitive crime matters. Such delays place avoidable strain upon court lists and bring an additional burden to already stretched defence teams.

Furthermore, the witness evidence preparation process necessitated repeated liaison with business owners and staff, who have endured the persistent strain of repeated retail loss and associated anxiety. The local Business Crime Reduction Partnership has been actively involved, providing a measure of intelligence collation and victim liaison that, while appreciated, remains under considerable resource pressure.  

It is a reminder to us all that offences of this sort do not occur in isolation but are embedded within a tapestry of social, economic, and institutional dynamics. This court has heard evidence, and received consistent submissions, emphasizing the borderline between criminal culpability and social hardship. While cognizant of that complexity, the function of the court remains focused squarely on the legal and factual matrix as it pertains to the individual before it.

The case has benefitted from the assistance of probation officers, notably Ms Eleanor Barratt, whose pre-sentence report proposals after this hearing will be pivotal in the final determination of appropriate disposal. Ms Barratt has maintained commendable professionalism under trying circumstances, dealing with a report that will need to address a full spectrum of risks and mitigation factors.

The Crown was ably represented by Ms Francesca Wainwright, whose written and oral submissions have been measured and consistent throughout. Mr Timothy Goldsmith instructed on your behalf has fulfilled his duties conscientiously, notwithstanding the pressures imposed by fluctuating Legal Aid authorisations and case delays. The court is grateful to both counsel for their diligent engagement.

The local probation service has faced acute staffing pressures, as have mental health trusts across the South West, which must be borne in mind when considering the wider context of engagement with support services and potential community-based disposals. Mental health waiting lists for specialist interventions continue to exceed twelve months in many instances, often compelling reliance on interim risk management rather than substantive therapeutic input.

Within these constraints, the court has taken careful note of Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, which remains the operative statutory provision. That section defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner. The court is further guided by the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guidelines (2024), which emphasise such considerations as the value of goods taken, the sophistication and planning evident in the offending, the impact upon victims, and whether any breach of trust or vulnerability was exploited.

The evolution of sentencing practice in this jurisdiction underscores the significance of the cumulative impact of repeated petty thefts. Though each individual item may be of modest value, the aggregate effect upon victims and communities, especially where businesses are small or locally run, can be considerable. This approach is informed by case law such as R v. Draycott [2023] EWCA Crim 893, where a sustained pattern of shoplifting justified an immediate custodial sentence despite relatively low individual theft values. The Court noted the multiplicity and planning evidenced in the offender’s conduct as determinants of seriousness.

Other relevant appellate decisions include R v. Shepherd [2022] EWCA Crim 749, which stressed the importance of early guilty pleas in securing sentence reductions and distinguished those entered late, particularly after trial preparation, as attracting less discount. Finally, reference may be made to R v. Palmer [2020] EWCA Crim 1631, dealing with the aggravating impact of repeated offending within a vulnerable community setting.

In ancillary contexts, it is noteworthy that other legal precedents cited during submissions, though dealing with divergent offences—such as R v. Shaw [2019] EWCA Crim 1235 concerning aggravated burglary, or R v. Christie [2018] EWCA Crim 845 concerning environmental offences—serve as illustrations of broader principles of culpability but bear no direct factual resemblance to your case.

I now turn to the factual circumstances surrounding the conduct to which you have pled guilty. It is, of course, axiomatic to observe that the particulars of the charge represent only a segment of the full and complex picture compiled through investigation, evidence gathering, and analysis. 

The police investigation was initiated following a series of reports from multiple retail premises experiencing a conspicuous uptick in shop thefts, many bearing striking similarities in method and appearance of the alleged offender. These premises ranged from local grocery stores to small pharmacies. Your arrest, effected on 8 March 2025, followed a concerted operation by officers from the Bristol City Police Retail Crime Unit, assisted by specialists from the Forensic Evidence Analysis Team, who utilised enhanced CCTV review, trading standards records, and comparative analysis of recovered items.

While the raw financial value of individual thefts was low, the pattern demonstrated a deliberate and systematic approach, including use of distraction, concealment, and apparently rehearsed timing to exploit staff vulnerabilities, such as during restocking or quiet periods. Store personnel reported increased anxiety and changes in working practices, with some employees requesting changes to shift patterns to avoid lone working during times you were present.

It is important to note that on at least two occasions your conduct included attempts to thwart detection by removing security labels and masking items within personal belongings. This indicates a level of planning inconsistent with a fleeting lapse in judgment. Moreover, your demeanour whilst on premises was described as calm and unruffled, evincing an apparent acceptance of risk inherent in the conduct but little concern for consequences.

Victim impact statements submitted to the court articulate a breadth of harm, beyond the mere financial loss. Small businesses reliant on tight margins described the demoralising effect of repeated losses, the psychological strain upon staff, and in some cases the necessity to reduce hours or close sections of stores temporarily. One owner spoke of the cumulative effect “undermining the sense of safety” in a tight-knit commercial community.

The Crown draws attention to the fact that you were previously the subject of community resolution measures intended to divert you away from offending. Their repetition, as evidenced, did not effect a reduction or cessation. This is a matter which compels serious consideration when calibrating the appropriate sentence.

Turning to the clinical and psychological assessments submitted, Dr Melanie Hussain, forensic psychiatrist, provided a detailed report at the request of your defence team. Dr Hussain’s evaluation, undertaken after extended interviews and review of medical records, concludes that you do not meet the diagnostic threshold for major mental illness but exhibit traits consistent with impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. There is mild evidence of substance dependency, particularly alcohol, and indications of financial hardship as contributory stressors.

Such factors, while relevant, do not mitigate the responsibility for repeated offending in the court’s view but may shape disposition regarding rehabilitation needs and risk management. The report notes a history of non-engagement with voluntary support services and intermittent compliance with probationary supervision.  

The probation assessment, submitted in conjunction with the psychiatric report, reflects a medium level of risk of reoffending and a low to medium risk of harm to the public. Importantly, it suggests that a proactive, structured community intervention may provide an opportunity for both rehabilitation and reduction in risk. Consideration is given to cognitive-behavioural programmes targeted at acquisitive offending and impulse control, alongside financial advice and substance misuse treatment.

The court is, of course, mindful of the pressures on probation services nationally. The current staffing shortfalls, exacerbated by broader contractual and recruitment challenges, limit capacity to deliver intensive case management to all who would benefit. Nonetheless, assessments indicate that your profile fits within the scope of existing frameworks designed for medium-risk adults.

It is pertinent at this juncture to remark upon procedural observations that have emerged during the course of proceedings. The Better Case Management approach has, in this instance, functioned with an efficacy deserving acknowledgment. Multiple directions hearings were conducted on schedule, and pre-trial disclosures completed within stipulated timescales. These processes, while often ripe for criticism in other cases, operated
