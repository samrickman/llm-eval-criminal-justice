IN THE CROWN COURT AT BELVEDERE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/14836  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. P. KENDRICK  
Filed: 15 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentencing following your conviction for theft, specifically shoplifting, committed over an extended period across various retail establishments in the Belvedere area and adjoining precincts. The charge is brought pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, and the case before the court concerns allegations of persistent and premised dishonesty, manifesting in repeated offences predominantly between September 2023 and April 2025.

Procedural Chronology and Context  
The matter has had a somewhat protracted procedural history, occasioned in part by administrative delays and multiple applications for the funding of expert reports under the Legal Aid Agency. Notwithstanding such procedural encumbrances, the listing and case management were principally governed by the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, designed to streamline criminal trials and encourage early resolution where appropriate. The court records show initial charge on 11 May 2025, with appearance at the Magistrates' Court on 14 May 2025, subsequent remand on bail under certain conditions, and transfer to this Crown Court on 9 June 2025 for plea and directions.

The court acknowledges the obligations of the BCM process, which, as iterated in numerous authorities, facilitates early identification of issues likely to arise during trial and allocates appropriate judicial time to each case. While full compliance with BCM timetables has not been realised—largely owing to the well-documented pressures upon Legal Aid authorisation channels—overall progress accords with procedural expectations.

It is paradoxical, albeit an unfortunate fixture of modern criminal justice, that low-level offending such as the present continues to consume disproportionate public resources. Surveillance analysis, witness cross-examination, forensic inspection, and evidential collation all impose time and financial burdens. Investigations of this kind, while outwardly minor in the scale of social harm, demand significant police deployment, as well as skilled prosecutorial and judicial attention, often creating an echo chamber of cumulative strain on an already overstretched system.

There are, moreover, notable operational limitations facing retail premises, community policing teams, and victim support frameworks. The National Retail Federation has recently reported a 6.8% year-on-year increase in shoplifting incidents attributed to organised retail crime, a phenomenon typically concentrated in urban centres, though not without spillover into suburban and rural locales. While this matter involves individual offending rather than organised activity, it shares with that broader trend a degree of persistence that requires sustained intervention. It is against this backdrop of cumulative and systemic pressure that the present proceedings are to be understood.

Recent months have also witnessed significant staff shortages within the Probation Service, leading to delays in report preparation and oversight, a matter regretted by all concerned, but largely beyond individual control. The Public Protection Unit has disclosed that caseloads routinely exceed established guidelines by as much as 30%, with consequent risks to the quality and timeliness of risk assessments.

The court also records with appreciation the written submissions received from the Belvedere Retailers' Alliance, a coalition of local businesses advocating for stronger responses to acquisitive crime. Their correspondence, while not part of evidentiary material, underscores the broader social consequences of persistent retail theft—highlighting not just fiscal impact but also the emotional and psychological toll on frontline staff.

Of course, judicial responsibility does not extend to public policy formulation or funding allocation. Nonetheless, these realities form an inescapable operating context within which cases such as this arise.

The court further acknowledges the recent refurbishment of Courtroom 5, installed with enhanced technology to facilitate hybrid hearings—an innovation reflecting a necessary adaptation posited in the post-pandemic landscape, intended to improve access and flexibility. Despite these advances, the human elements of judicial process—exemplified in the meticulous advocacy of counsel and the professional conduct of court officers—remain absolutely crucial.

Turning now to the substantive evidence, the prosecution presented a detailed and cohesive narrative buttressed by digital and witness testimony, including statements from loss prevention officers, video capture from multiple premises, and receipts for recovered property. It was evident from the trial that your conduct followed a consistent pattern, often involving the selection of high-demand consumables such as toiletries, small electronics accessories, and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals.

This court is mindful that the scope of acquisitive offending encompasses a range of behaviours from impulsive shoplifting to carefully planned and recurrent theft. The latter is of particular concern as it typifies an entrenched pattern, one which may necessitate not only custodial responses but also rehabilitative measures aimed at disentangling complex criminogenic needs.

I am aware that the defendant has no known gang affiliations, nor is there evidence to suggest involvement in trafficking or organised retail crime rings. This distinction is material, insofar as it affects risk classification and appropriate sentencing pathways.

In the course of proceedings, the defence sought to highlight mitigating contextual factors, including socio-economic hardship and mental health difficulties. These claims were set out in a detailed Psychiatric Report authored by Dr Kathryn Bellingham, Consultant Psychiatrist, submitted on 21 July 2025. Dr Bellingham's assessment identifies no psychotic or mood disorder but notes traits consistent with intermittent depressive episodes and maladaptive coping mechanisms. The report candidly acknowledges the absence of sustained engagement with mental health services, while emphasising the risks of untreated emotional distress contributing to impulsivity.

The relevant passage reads: “Mr H exhibits features indicative of subclinical anxiety and mild cognitive distortions related to self-esteem and future orientation. While not meeting formal criteria for a major mental illness, these factors could reasonably be expected to influence behaviour and decision-making under stress.” The report recommends consideration of community-based psychological intervention alongside social support, while underscoring the need for ongoing monitoring.

I note with regret the procedural delays occasioned by prolonged communication with the Legal Aid Agency regarding the funding and instruction of independent experts. This court has previously issued observations regarding the procedural hurdles defendants face when seeking to access specialised assessment. The Administrative Justice Council recently published findings on the deleterious effect of these barriers on timely case progression and equitable justice outcomes.

Although not applicable here, the court points to R v. Dunmore [2019] EWCA Crim 223 as a landmark ruling affirming the necessity of expeditious psychological assessment in cases involving alleged mental health factors. While the facts of Dunmore, involving serious assault and a significant psychiatric diagnosis, are plainly distinguishable, the underlying principles affirm the centrality of timely expert evaluation.

The defence also presented numerous letters attesting to your character and recent efforts to engage with charitable agencies, including correspondence from United Neighbourhood Hope (UNH), a local homelessness support charity. Their letter dated 3 August 2025 affirms that you attended initial assessments but had yet to demonstrate consistent engagement. Such efforts are to be commended insofar as they mark a potential turning point, but at present remain embryonic in terms of rehabilitation potential.

The court exercises some caution in evaluating such endorsements; while expressions of support reflect genuine professional caring, systemic pressures on voluntary sector organisations limit their capacity to offer long-term intervention. UNH itself reports funding constraints and staff turnover which have, in recent years, affected service continuity.

Further background submitted included a victim impact statement from Ms Dolores Haynes, manager of Pennyworth's Convenience Store, who outlined the emotional strain imposed upon her staff and the financial losses sustained. Ms Haynes's statement commends the professionalism of her employees in difficult circumstances, yet emphasises the anxiety and sense of vulnerability engendered by repeat theft.

The court recognises that harm in shoplifting cases transcends pure commercial loss. The psychological impact on retail workers—many of whom occupy precarious or low-paid roles—is well documented. Anxiety, fear of confrontation, and occupational stress contribute to a deleterious work environment.

Turning to the facts of the offending behaviour as presented in court transcripts and evidence schedules:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

The pattern of your offending reflects a degree of sophistication: the use of specific clothing layers to obscure items, timing visits to coincide with staff changes, and selection of concealed exit routes.

It is worth noting that, despite the absence of explicit threats or violence, your actions occasioned tangible fear among staff. One employee reported adjusting her work hours and avoiding lone shifts due to concern about your presence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

The court recalls the observations in R v. Byrne [2020] EWCA Crim 1245, a case addressing the intimidation effects accompanying repeated theft in small retail outlets. There, the Court reinforced the principle that even non-violent conduct warranting fear or distress can elevate culpability.

Such aggravating factors are germane here, particularly given the sustained nature of your offending.

A further incident described in evidence involved your removal of electronic security tags from items in plain sight of other customers. This affrontery not only breaches legal strictures but undermines the deterrent value of commercial security measures.

The court has also reviewed Details of a co-defendant implicated in unrelated offences involving criminal damage and possession of a bladed article on school premises. Those matters are not relevant to your sentencing and fall outside the scope of today's consideration.

Equally, the court dismisses any conflation with a nearby case involving fly-tipping on greenbelt land by unrelated defendants, as well as the recent affray outside The Red Lion public house involving a separate group of individuals, none of whom have any connection to you.
