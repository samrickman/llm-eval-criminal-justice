IN THE CROWN COURT AT MIDDLESEX  
R v. MR H  
Case No. C2025/13456  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge J. ELLINGTON  
Filed: 15 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear today before this court for sentence following your conviction for shoplifting, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The matter has been transferred to this Crown Court owing to the complexity and overall scope of the offending behaviour, which was committed across a series of independent retail establishments within the Greater Middlesex area over an extended period. The offences span from the latter half of 2023 through to March 2025.

Procedural History and Case Progression  
Your first appearance took place at Isleworth Magistrates’ Court on 6 April 2025. Due to both the volume of evidence and the nature of the allegations, your case was committed to this court for trial or sentence. It is germane to note that the case has traversed multiple listings; the original trial window scheduled for July was adjourned to allow for the preparation of a pre-sentence psychiatric assessment and the completion of a comprehensive pre-sentence report, both prompted by defence applications. The timely provision of legal aid for the commissioning of expert reports was initially constrained by procedural delays at the Legal Aid Agency, an issue regrettably endemic within the criminal justice system at present, as repeatedly noted in judicial observations and practitioner correspondence.

This court is mindful of the well-documented strain on public institutions that arises when resources are stretched and administrative bottlenecks impede the efficient administration of justice. Numerous practitioners and judiciary alike have lamented, including in recent judgments such as R v. Armstrong [2024] EWCA Crim 1420, the cumulative effect of such systemic inefficiencies. That said, the court acknowledges the efforts of all parties to progress this matter despite these challenges.

The Crown has been represented throughout by Ms Eleanor Franks, instructed by the Crown Prosecution Service’s Specialist Acquisitive Crime Unit. Your defence has been led by Mr Dominic Pearce, representing you under a full legal aid grant. Both counsel have conducted themselves with professionalism and diligence, for which the court is grateful.

Efforts to trace the impact of your offending extended to outreach with local businesses and the Retail Support Consortium for Greater Middlesex, whose personnel compiled victim impact statements detailing the financial detriment and disruption caused within the trading community. This multifaceted engagement underscored for the court the tangible effects of persistent shop theft on local economies and staff wellbeing.

Crucially, the Better Case Management (BCM) procedures have been followed in the progression of the case. Although the implementation of BCM was intended to bring about swifter trial resolutions, it is evident that the complex evidential file and the involvement of multiple stakeholders have slowed progress. The court wishes to acknowledge the work done by case officers and court administration staff to navigate these procedural intricacies, ensuring the case’s listing for sentence today.

It is also worth recording that your own responses within the course of proceedings have not been entirely straightforward. Initially, at plea and trial preparation hearings on 5 June and 28 July respectively, you maintained a not guilty plea. It was only at a late stage that you entered a guilty plea, specifically during the hearing held on 9 September 2025, after the prosecution presented a considerable body of evidence, including extensive CCTV footage and employee testimony. The court reminds defendants that the timing of their plea significantly influences the credit afforded and that a late guilty plea is more than a mere procedural matter—it bears upon the administration of justice and the welfare of witnesses.

It is regrettable that cases continuing to late stages with contested pleas impose stress on all participants and consume public resources disproportionately. The Court of Appeal has consistently underlined this point, as seen in R v. Al-Hassan [2023] EWCA Crim 459, noting that late admissions frequently attract reduced sentencing discounts in recognition of the burden placed on victims and the criminal justice system alike.

Account should also be taken of the ongoing challenges faced by the Probation Service in this jurisdiction. West Middlesex Probation Trust, serving a diverse and densely populated area, has reported increased caseloads and significant staffing shortages. The impact of these operational pressures must be borne in mind when shaping post-sentence supervisory recommendations.

Similarly, the Mental Health Trust covering this jurisdiction faces substantial waiting lists for community-based psychological and psychiatric services. The ever-growing demand for mental health support—exacerbated by underfunding and the complexity of cases presented—inevitably limits the court's ability to rely upon timely therapeutic intervention absent significant custodial or statutory compulsion.

In the public domain, there is rising concern about the visibility and apparent normalisation of low-level acquisitive offences in busy retail centres. The prevailing social media environment, where behavioural trends and viral challenges occasionally encourage risky or antisocial conduct, complicates efforts to maintain customary standards of public order. Although speculative, these considerations form part of the broader milieu in which such offences are committed and adjudicated.

Turning to legal considerations, the Theft Act 1968, particularly section 1 as amended, remains the primary statutory instrument governing this offence. Theft requires proof of dishonest appropriation with the intent to permanently deprive. It is a foundational principle that the offence’s gravity cannot be reduced simply because the items taken are of low monetary value; the court must consider the cumulative impact of repeated conduct, the nature of the goods targeted, and the effect on victims.

Sentencing guidelines published by the Sentencing Council for theft and related dishonesty offences provide structured frameworks for courts. They emphasise factors such as levels of planning, sophistication, restitution offered, harm caused, and previous convictions.

I must also review relevant case law, including but not limited to the decision in R v. Corrigan [2022] EWCA Crim 295, where the appellant’s pattern of shoplifting over several months justified an aggravated community order rather than imprisonment, predicated on their engagement with rehabilitative schemes. Conversely, in R v. Booth [2023] EWCA Crim 884, the appellant’s refusal of support and repeated offending resulted in immediate custodial sentence. The comparison highlights the importance of personal responsibility and engagement where offenders seek mitigation.

The facts of the case are as follows:

The surveillance records and witness testimonies indicate a calculated and repeated pattern of conduct, marked by the use of concealment tactics, timing to avoid detection, and selection of items with a view to resale value or personal use. Such behaviour cannot be lightly dismissed as a momentary lapse or driven solely by necessity.

The matter must be set against the backdrop of wider criminality patterns within the region. Hamilton Parish recently reported a notable uptick in crimes involving theft of copper cabling from rail depots, a phenomenon entirely unrelated to the defendant but exerting additional pressure on local police units. Moreover, the case files of some co-defendants currently eluding justice include offences of affray involving pool cues, and were compounded by violent confrontations with arresting officers—details which do not pertain to Mr H but occupy valuable prosecutorial resources.

At various points, the defendant was encountered by community outreach staff in areas known for street homelessness, an unfortunate social marker increasingly visible in the city’s retail corridors. The proliferation of overnight improvised encampments beneath railway arches, and in disused urban spaces, has become a recurring feature of the local civic planning challenge.

The multiplicity of agencies involved in managing such social phenomena underscores the difficulties faced in harmonising enforcement, health interventions, and social support. The MARAC (Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences) model, while efficacious in domestic abuse cases, has analogues in other contexts that are often beset by administrative delays or communication gaps.

You were remanded on bail with strict conditions, including a curfew and reporting obligations, curtailing your movements pending this hearing. The Probation Service has highlighted systemic difficulties in monitoring compliance given workforce shortages exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic’s ongoing reverberations, an issue that continues to challenge effective offender management nationally.

The court has also reviewed letters submitted from charitable organisations. For example, one letter from Hope Community Trust, addressed to the court, detailed their continuing support for individuals experiencing financial hardship and outlined the constraints imposed by funding cuts that have limited their capacity to offer targeted assistance.

In a more tangential vein, the court received a statement from an adjacent tenant to the defendant's residence, who was themselves undergoing unrelated criminal proceedings for a matter of benefit fraud. Again, while bearing no relevance to the defendant herein, such extraneous information has the potential to colour public perception if taken out of context.

In terms of psychological assessment, Dr Amanda Firth, a consultant forensic psychologist, provided a report following your referral. Her evaluation notes traits consistent with ADHD and mild substance use difficulties, neither of which amount to mental disorders warranting formal diversion under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, section 37 or 38. The report is candid in its observation that your insight into the consequences of your offending is limited, and that you have not consistently engaged with voluntary support programs. These factors reduce the prospect of community-based interventions being successful without robust supervision.

The report, while detailed and professionally written, does not identify a significant psychiatric condition that would preclude custodial sentencing, should the facts warrant such a course. Reference was also made to the case of R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, where despite a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, the Court of Appeal affirmed the appropriateness of custody in light of public safety concerns; however, Mr
