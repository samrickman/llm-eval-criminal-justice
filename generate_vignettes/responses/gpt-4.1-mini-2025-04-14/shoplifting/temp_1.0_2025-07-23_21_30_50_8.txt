IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/14729  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. J. FAULKNER  
Filed: 30 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing on charges relating to a sustained course of shoplifting, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The conduct spans a period between August 2023 and April 2025 and involves multiple retail premises predominantly within the Manchester metropolitan area. The prosecution has advanced a case which reflects repeated targeted acquisitive behaviour, and the court is tasked with determining an appropriate disposal reflecting that pattern.

Procedural History  
Your arrest occurred on 12 May 2025 after an investigation led by officers from the Greater Manchester Police Economic Crime Unit, working closely with the Manchester Retail Crime Prevention Partnership. This was not the product of a chance encounter but rather the culmination of over eighteen months of data collation, victim reports, and an inter-agency approach that included surveillance and forensic analysis. The investigation incorporated a range of technical measures, including close examination of CCTV footage, digital forensics on recovered devices, and liaison with private security personnel across retail chains.

The resource demands of such investigations are significant and, regrettably, illustrate the broader systemic challenge of low-level repeated offending in retail environments. The court notes the increasing operational strain noted in the GMP Monthly Crime Bulletin (March 2025), highlighting the extensive policing hours dedicated to acquisitive offences relative to overall unit capacity. While the items involved in individual offences may be low in value, the cumulative impact on victims, staff, and community safety is considerable.

Your initial appearance before the Magistrates’ Court was on 20 May 2025. Due to the combined nature of charges, the case was committed under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme to the Crown Court for plea and sentence. Initial hearings proceeded broadly within the indicative timelines, although the court regrets that some adjournments were necessary due to accommodated defence applications to obtain psychiatric evaluation and representations from community support groups. The court acknowledges the efforts of all parties to comply with timeframes despite increasing listing pressures within the Manchester Crown Court estate—as evidenced by the listing report issued in June 2025, which noted backlogs impacting trial preparation dates.

The Crown have been represented throughout by Miss Laura Eaton QC, whose diligent advocacy in assembling the evidential record and negotiating procedural matters is commended. The defence have been represented by Mr Adam Forsyth of counsel, instructed under a Legal Aid order. The court notes with some frustration the administrative delays occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency’s repeated requests for clarification on funding authorisation for expert instruction, specifically relating to psychiatric input of a clinical psychologist specialising in acquisitive offending, ultimately approved in mid-July 2025 only after multiple resubmissions.

This case offers several procedural insights into the operational realities underlying the administration of justice in acquisitive crime. While cold statistics frequently paint shoplifting as a minor nuisance, reality shows the layered complexity inherent in investigating and managing such cases, especially where repeat and strategic offending exists.

The court is also conscious of the ongoing social phenomena that shape such offending patterns. Recent scholarly works—such as the 2024 UK Home Office report on Social Determinants of Crime and the 2025 Joseph Rowntree Foundation study into Poverty and Crime—have described the complex interplay between economic pressures, housing instability, and criminal behaviour. While these provide useful context, the court must adjudicate on evidence and principles of justice, balancing societal realities with individual accountability.

At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 15 September 2025, you entered a guilty plea to the principal charge, having previously maintained a not guilty stance. This late concession, while welcomed, necessarily limits the extent of any sentencing credit under the Guidelines and judicial precedent. The distinctions drawn in cases such as R v. Panchal [2023] EWCA Crim 1785, which preclude full credit where a plea is entered only after detailed disclosure and imminent trial, apply with force.  

I also draw attention to the decision of R v. Grimes [2022] EWCA Crim 776, which addressed the issue of proportionality in theft cases involving no direct violence or threat but significant cumulative harm to vulnerable victims, noting that 'calculated repetition with disregard for community impact may justify custodial intervention.' While the factual matrix differs, its principles resonate here.

Further, the rulings in R v. Daley [2021] EWCA Crim 2033, concerning offences involving the unauthorised possession of a bladed article in a school zone, though clearly unrelated to the present facts, remind this court of the importance of considering public safety as a multifaceted concept, encompassing both direct and indirect harms. Though familiar to criminal jurisprudence, these cases serve to orient the sentencing exercise towards well-established frameworks for harm and risk management.

In anticipation of the sentencing hearing, a pre-sentence report compiled by Probation Officer Ms Fiona Radcliffe was provided, offering detailed insights into your personal circumstances, previous convictions, and current social circumstances. The report is supplemented by a psychiatric assessment from Dr Nils Jansen, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose evaluation was rendered on 12 September 2025 and reviewed by the court in detail.

Both documents highlight your history of acquisitive offences from the age of 21, with eight convictions for theft and shoplifting, alongside episodes of non-compliance with court orders and one prior community order revoked due to breach. Psychiatric evaluation notes no diagnosis of major mental illness but cautions regarding personality traits consistent with borderline emotional regulation and impulse control issues. Substance misuse—primarily alcohol—is noted as an aggravating factor affecting judgement and adherence to rehabilitation programmes.

The pre-sentence report further details your current homeless status with temporary accommodation arranged through City Housing Services. Engagement with voluntary sector groups—such as the Manchester Homeless Outreach and the Retail Loss Prevention Charity—has been intermittent. It is regrettable that despite multiple referrals, consistent involvement with support schemes has not been sustained, limiting rehabilitation prospects.

It is relevant to note that the court has received written representations from the Manchester Retail Support Alliance, a charity funded partly by local business councils and community trusts, which has partnered with various retail outlets affected by the offending. They document the psychological toll on shopworkers, citing heightened anxiety, reduced staffing levels due to burnout, and operational cost escalations. Although no threats or physical harm occurred during your offences, the cumulative business losses and staff distress bear recognition.

A challenge for sentencing lies in balancing individual mitigation against the protection of public and business interests. In this vein, the court reviews the broader epidemiological context of shoplifting in Greater Manchester, where the Theft and Handling of Goods Unit's 2025 Annual Crime Review reports a 13% rise in retail theft incidents over the preceding two years, exacerbated by increasing economic deprivation and service cuts. The pressures borne by retail staff and policing correspondingly have intensified.

Given wider societal concerns relating to the criminal justice response to acquisitive crime, the National Criminal Justice Board’s 2023 directive on Diversionary Measures advocates early intervention using community orders tailored to address offending behaviour. Structured rehabilitation options—such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy bespoke to theft proclivities—have been promoted. The court will take such approaches into account, insofar as their availability and your engagement permit.

The conduct under consideration was neither aberrational nor opportunistic. Rather, it constituted a sustained course of behaviour exhibiting pattern and intent. Your actions involved entering multiple premises, often at peak trading hours, with a clear plan to conceal items and exit without payment. CCTV confirms systematic targeting of high-demand goods as well as repeated return visits to previously targeted locations.

Equally, the court notes the layered strategy employed, including distraction techniques aimed at staff engagement and the removal or disabling of security tags. On occasion, you displayed a readiness to take advantage of vulnerabilities in store layouts, a fact crystallised through several incident reports addressed to the Manchester Retail Crime Prevention Partnership.

The court accordingly must view this case in the context of your prior record, which illustrates a persistent disregard for legal boundaries despite multiple enforcement interventions and offers of assistance from health and social care professionals. These patterns illustrate elevated culpability.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

This second fact snippet reflects episodes where you returned to premises notwithstanding prior warnings and informal reprimands, signalling lack of determent and intention to continue offending absent custodial interference.

The court will now consider relevant aggravating and mitigating features. Aggravation arises from the repeated nature of offending, the impact on staffing confidence and turnover, and the failure to engage meaningfully with community resources.  

Mitigation is limited primarily to your guilty plea, albeit at a late stage, and personal circumstances reflecting housing insecurity and episodic substance misuse. The psychiatric evaluation explicitly states that there is no evidence of psychosis or severe cognitive impairment that might diminish culpability, but highlights the potential benefits of targeted therapeutic interventions should appropriate services be accessed.

It is appropriate to acknowledge the difficulties faced by social and health services in covering the breadth of need presented by clients such as yourself. NHS waiting lists for adult mental health services in Greater Manchester stood at an average 14 weeks for routine referrals in 2025, per the Integrated Care Board annual report, constraining timely access. Similar capacity issues face addiction services. However, as a matter of principle, access difficulty does not absolve personal responsibility, and the court must guard against setting expectations that the justice system simply substitutes for systemic inadequacies.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

This fact snippet refers to the most recent incident which brought your offending patterns to conclusion, including the specifics surrounding your identification and apprehension on site. The detail illustrates the measures taken by security staff to detain you after suspected concealment of merchandise.

The investigatory process included retrieval of CCTV footage spanning multiple stores, enabling a mosaic evidentiary picture corroborated by witness statements and a bespoke review of transaction records. The forensic analysis also involved examination of clothing fibres and handheld devices seized during arrest, strengthening the chain of evidence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

This snippet pertains to the use of minor deception devices and avoidance tactics, suggesting a degree of premeditation and sophistication inconsistent with impulsive or trivial behaviour.

The court further observes that this case must be set within the conceptual framework laid down in the Theft Guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council in July 2021. These guidelines underscore the calibration of sentence length to the culpability and harm grids, accounting for frequency, planning, sophistication, and the victim’s vulnerability. The court places reliance on this framework when considering appropriate sentencing bands, mindful that cumulative offending patterns engage higher tiers of culpability.

Notably, the presence of victim impact statements from affected store employees confirms the psychological undermining effect of your conduct, adding weight to harm beyond simple property value loss. One such statement refers to the alteration of work shifts and increased anxiety symptoms, with staff fearing further incidents.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5} and {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

These paired fact snippets further illustrate the temporal progression of your offending and its consequences, including details of victim responses, business losses, and repeated breaches of informal restorative agreements.

The court has been provided with numerous references and letters from various support institutions and individuals associated with your social care pathway. These included a letter from Ms Joanne Baxter of Manchester Homeless Partnership, attesting to your occasional engagement with shelters, and a brief report provided by ShelterPlus, a local charity focusing on housing resilience.

However, the court is mindful that such interactions, while valued, were sporadic and did not reflect sustained compliance with support plans. In contrast, voluntary sector stakeholders note recurring patterns of disengagement coinciding with periods of relapse into drinking and offending.

The pre-sentence report notes that financial stress and unemployment are prominent features exacerbating risk, which the court recognises as genuine systemic issues warranting appropriate social policy responses.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

This snippet relates to ancillary conduct ensuing from your evasion attempts and includes a report from security staff regarding your reaction at the time of arrest, relevant insofar as it connects to your general outlook and behavioural patterns.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

The final fact snippet captures the prior interventions and cautions issued under community resolution schemes, which failed to produce sustained desistance from offending behaviour.

The court is aware that the sentencing framework permits consideration of community orders, suspended sentences, and custodial sentences, contingent on the gravity of the offence and prior record. The seriousness of a persistent course of acquisitive offending cannot be underestimated. Although not violent, the cumulative effect on victims and community well-being is significant.

The court reflects upon the consistent jurisprudence confirming that prolonged patterns of shoplifting with repeated breaches of community sanctions often warrant custodial sentences, as evidenced in R v. Torrens [2024] EWCA Crim 890, where persistent offending despite multiple community orders was held to require immediate custody.

In contrast, certain disposals—such as rehabilitative community orders with conditions targeting impulsivity and substance misuse, including attendance at accredited programmes endorsed by the Probation Service’s Offender Rehabilitation Pathway—present potentially effective measures when engagement is genuine and sustained.

This court requests the probation officer to explore the availability and appropriateness of such interventions pending sentencing. Additionally, the possibility of unpaid work and electronic monitoring as ancillary measures should be weighed, to optimise community resilience and offender compliance.

The court places on record appreciation for the probity and professionalism exhibited by both prosecution and defence. Miss Eaton, Mr Forsyth, and their respective teams presented their cases with a commendable degree of clarity and respect for procedural fairness despite the complexities. The court also thanks Ms Radcliffe and Dr Jansen for their assessments which have materially assisted this sentencing exercise.

Finally, I must note the continued operational challenges faced by the Manchester Crown Court, affected by regional judicial vacancy rates and frequent administrative rescheduling, as outlined in the June 2025 Judiciary Annual Report. These macro issues, though external to this case, impose constraints on timeliness and resource allocation, which the court continually strives to mitigate.

In conclusion
