IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/14862  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. Fairfax  
Filed: 14 November 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence upon your conviction of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968. The offending in question relates to a series of incidents occurring over an extended period across various retail premises in the Manchester city area and neighbouring boroughs. Given the multiplicity of occasions and locations involved, the Crown has appropriately brought a consolidated charge to reflect the course of conduct discerned.

Procedural History  
Your initial appearance before Manchester Magistrates’ Court took place on 3 August 2025 following your arrest on 29 July 2025. The arrest emanated from a joint operation involving officers from the Greater Manchester Police Retail Crime Unit and intelligence officers embedded within the North Manchester Business Crime Partnership. This operation was the culmination of a considerable investigatory effort spanning approximately four weeks, focused on persistent thefts affecting a network of independently owned shops and high street chains.  
Much has been said regarding the evolution of multi-agency partnerships to confront the phenomenon of retail crime. The North Manchester Business Crime Partnership, established in 2017, is representative of the kind of strategic collaboration encouraged nationally. Its remit involves facilitating rapid intelligence sharing among retailers, police units, and local authorities to disrupt offending patterns. While the concept is sound in theory, implementation remains uneven, complicated by a range of factors including resource limitations, variations in commitment levels, and challenges in maintaining effective case management systems. It is fair to note, however, that in the present matter, the cooperative framework is to be commended for achieving appropriate information flow and supporting the timely identification of repeat offending.  
Your case was subsequently committed to the Crown Court on 15 September 2025 following a preliminary hearing at the Magistrates’ Court where the evidence against you was found sufficiently compelling to require trial or plea in this higher forum. A plea and trial preparation hearing was listed for 10 October 2025, at which you entered a guilty plea. The late nature of this plea is a factor I shall take into account in due course.  
It is regrettable but all too common in cases of this kind that defendants defer their decisions regarding pleas, often waiting until the prosecution file has been thoroughly amassed and any inconsistencies in evidence addressed. The resulting impact is far from trivial: it imposes a burden on court lists already stretched thin, disrupts the scheduling of witnesses, and extends uncertainty for victims and business owners alike.

The better case management (BCM) framework, intended to improve case progression and encourage early engagement, was applied throughout your proceedings. I acknowledge and record the diligent work of the Crown Prosecution Service in this regard, as well as the effective case management conducted by court listing officers. Yet the reality remains that delays in obtaining necessary reports and expert opinions continued to frustrate an earlier finalisation of your case.   
The Legal Aid Agency’s role in funding defence representation and expert assessments warrants comment. It is lamentable that your solicitor’s application for a psychiatric evaluation was not approved until four weeks after initial submission. Such delays have become disturbingly commonplace and serve only to extend the duration defendants spend in procedural limbo, sometimes at considerable personal and financial cost. These frequent shortcomings cannot simply be excused as administrative overhead but indicate a need for systemic reform.  
The court records its thanks to your legal representative, Mr Nathan Forrest, who has conducted your defence throughout with evident professionalism and appropriate diligence, notwithstanding the challenges posed. Similarly, Ms Diane Radcliffe, prosecuting on behalf of the Crown, has presented the case with clarity and adherence to both law and principle.

Legal Context  
Section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968 provides the definition of theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. The thefts charged against you fall squarely within this statutory framework. Conventionally, repeated shoplifting offences pose significant difficulties in sentencing: they often involve relatively low-value items, minimal or no physical violence, and little immediate harm but collectively cause substantial disruption to retail businesses and their employees.  
The Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences issued in 2021 underscores the importance of considering factors such as premeditation, sophistication, previous history, and the impact on victims—not merely the monetary value of items taken. The guideline cautions courts to regard offences involving vulnerable targets, use of deception, or deliberate repeated offending as meriting elevated seriousness.  
Recent appellate decisions provide supplemental insight into appropriate sentencing approaches. In R v. Emmet [2023] EWCA Crim 1842, the Court of Appeal reinforced that repeated acquisitive offending that exhibits clear planning or entrenched behaviour may warrant custodial sentences despite an absence of violence.  
Moreover, the Court’s ruling in R v. Pryce [2024] EWCA Crim 2177 is instructive. There, a serial offender targeting small independent pharmacies was sentenced to a term of immediate custody, primarily on the basis of the psychological impact on staff and the erosion of confidence within a vulnerable commercial community. The emphasis placed on harm beyond mere financial loss is pertinent to your case.  
At the same time, appellate authorities caution that custodial sentences must be proportionate and balanced against the prospect of rehabilitation. The judiciary continues to encourage the use of community disposals, particularly in cases featuring underlying vulnerabilities or social disadvantage.

The above factual description is drawn from statements obtained from store security personnel, CCTV footage, and subsequent police interviews.  
Forensic analysis included an examination of items seized at the time of your arrest and during searches of your residence. Clothing recovered bore fibres and residues consistent with multiple shoplifting incidents. The CCTV evidence, while at times obscured or affected by poor angle and timing discrepancies, nonetheless presented sufficiently clear images to allow positive identification.  
It bears noting that the reliability of CCTV evidence in retail theft cases has been the subject of judicial scrutiny on numerous occasions. The courts remain vigilant to the potential for misidentification given often imperfect recording conditions. However, when combined with other corroborative evidence, as here, the probative value increases markedly.

A witness statement from Ms Laura Penrose, manager of the High Street Grocers outlet, details the distress caused to her staff by repeated incidents attributed to your conduct. She describes a shrinking team morale, increasing absenteeism, and a heightened sense of vulnerability that has persisted for months — effects that can ripple through small businesses in ways not easily quantifiable. The cumulative impact on community well-being is thus considerable, extending beyond mere loss of stock. This court recognises the importance of such victim impact evidence.

Expert Assessments and Psychological Reports  
Following the directions of this court at the pre-trial phase, a psychiatric report was commissioned and prepared by Dr Alan Rutherford, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose detailed analysis I have reviewed in full. Dr Rutherford notes that although you do not meet criteria for a severe mental health disorder, there are indications of underlying impulsivity, episodes of low mood, and tendencies towards emotional instability.  
He further observed that your engagement with previous support services has, at best, been intermittent and incomplete, limiting the therapeutic benefit available. The report suggests some risk factors pertinent to reoffending, notably unemployment, lack of stable housing, and sporadic substance misuse. Despite this, the risk of serious harm to others is assessed as low, albeit with cautionary remarks regarding recidivism in respect of acquisitive crime.  
The value of such clinical input is well recognised. Sentencing must blend punitive, deterrent, and rehabilitative aims, and an accurate understanding of an offender’s personal circumstances enhances the court’s capacity to balance these objectives appropriately.  
It is instructive to recall the guidance in R v. Didcott [2018] EWCA Crim 1321, which emphasised the role of expert evidence in enabling sentencing courts to tailor interventions that are proportionate, realistic, and mindful of individual vulnerabilities without compromising public protection.

Probation Service Assessments  
The probation service has furnished a pre-sentence report prepared by Officer Miriam Clarke. Her observations and recommendations offer a comprehensive appraisal of your personal background, social circumstances, and prospects for rehabilitation. She highlights periods of homelessness and temporary accommodation, noting the precariousness of your living situation. There is no suggestion of gang or organised crime involvement, nor evidence of coercion or exploitation.  
The report outlines a history of prior offending largely confined to acquisitive crimes, including several previous convictions for shoplifting. It also references your limited engagement with voluntary sector support agencies.  
The Probation Officer recommends consideration be given to a community sentence incorporating rehabilitation activity requirements, focusing on developing coping strategies, promoting engagement with employment services, and addressing substance misuse where applicable.  
This approach aligns with the Sentencing Council’s emphasis on structured community orders as the preferred method, where viable, for lower-level offending. However, the report also acknowledges the significant challenges posed by your apparent resistance to consistent service uptake and the risk of non-compliance.

It is worth briefly noting that the Probation Service in Manchester, like many jurisdictions, is enduring considerable pressures. The demand for their input far exceeds capacity, resulting in high caseloads and stretched resources. Such strain inevitably affects the quality and timeliness of reports, an unfortunate reality that colours the entire sentencing process.

Other Considerations  
I turn to the social context in which your offending occurs. The city of Manchester, like many urban centres, has witnessed increasing difficulties related to street-level crime, economic deprivation, and housing insecurity. The current climate includes rising reports of street homelessness—and related issues such as begging, petty acquisitive crime, and associated antisocial behaviour—compounded by public service austerity and fragmented support infrastructures.  
Though these macro factors do not excuse individual criminal conduct, they inform the environment in which offenders and communities coexist. The court has repeatedly observed the erosion of traditional social capital and community support networks, phenomena that contribute subtly to the genesis and perpetuation of offending behaviour.  
It is also a feature of recent years that local authority budgets for housing and social care have contracted, leading to protracted waiting lists for mental health services and delays in securing emergency accommodation. This confluence of challenges complicates the task of rehabilitation and necessitates a holistic sentencing response, where possible.  
Still, it must be said that among those with comparable circumstances, many make lawful choices and do not resort to crime. The law cannot—and should not—treat poverty or hardship as immunity from criminal responsibility.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Relevant case law relating to plea timing and sentencing credit is of course pertinent here. The Court recalls the decision in R v. Mellor [2022] EWCA Crim 1929, which stressed that while credit should encourage early admissions of guilt, it should not reward procedural gamesmanship or tactical delay. That judgment clarified that a plea entered partway through proceedings attracts reduced credit to reflect the additional burdens placed on witnesses and the court.  
In your case, the plea came after significant investigation and evidential collation, and while credit for plea is merited, it falls short of the full discount available at the earliest stages of proceedings.  
I also consider the principles underscored in R v. Stroud [2023] EWCA Crim 1017, which dealt with repeat offenders and cautioned that persistent acquisitive crime, if unaddressed, can feed into a cycle of escalating offending and demands a firm judicial response proportionate to public protection needs.

Discussion of Red Herrings and Peripheral Issues  
Before concluding, it is necessary — though occasionally frustrating — to acknowledge the frequent inclusion, in cases of this nature, of extraneous or tangential material. For example, the Crown’s bundle references cases of arson prosecutions from different jurisdictions, including R v. Halpern [2021] EWCA Crim 415 involving the destruction of commercial premises in Cheltenham. While entirely unrelated, such citations sometimes find their way into court documents as cautionary exemplars of the need for sentences to reflect community safety risks, even when the facts are dissimilar in kind and gravity.  
Similarly, references are made in papers regarding the current operational challenges faced by the Legal Aid Agency and probation departments—though not specifically in relation to your case. These observations serve as important backdrop but should not be conflated with particulars of your offending or personal circumstances.  
The court also notes correspondence included from third parties such as the Manchester Homelessness Outreach Bureau and a local charity supporting youth at risk; though relevant to wider social concerns, these do not alter sentencing assessments in your individual matter.  
There is an occasional temptation to conflate the actions of co-defendants or associate cases charged simultaneously but not joined with your own. It is vital to recognise that the criminal justice process strictly distinguishes between separate actors and offences.

Sentencing Outlook and Conclusion  
Having considered all material before the court, including the representations of counsel, the forensic and psychiatric reports, the probation assessment, and the statutory framework, I conclude that a custodial sentence is not obligatory but remains a potential outcome. The final determination will depend upon the detailed analysis of the pre-sentence report, particularly regarding your compliance potential and engagement with rehabilitative programmes.  
If a community order is deemed unsuitable or likely to fail, the court retains the option of immediate custody to mark the seriousness of your actions and protect the wider community from ongoing harm. In that event, the duration would reflect the aggregate impact of your offending course and the need for deterrence.  
It is imperative, therefore, to await the probation report which will advise on your amenability to intervention, risk level, and suitable programme options. The court anticipates that this report will be compiled promptly and comprehensively.  
I would encourage you to engage fully with all available opportunities to demonstrate your commitment to change. Rehabilitation is not simply a theoretical goal but a practical necessity, both for yourself and for the society which your conduct has affected.  
Your case exemplifies the difficult task posed by persistent shoplifting offending: balancing mercy with accountability, understanding with deterrence. The court’s overriding duty remains the protection of the public and the maintenance of confidence in the justice system.

These sentencing remarks are made this day, the 14th of November 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. All proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal judgment and sentence will be entered and transmitted to the appropriate authorities for effect. You are advised of your right to appeal the sentence imposed within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no special reporting restrictions applicable under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 in this matter. No further orders are made on costs.

These are the orders of the court.
