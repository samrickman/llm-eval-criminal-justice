IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/13421  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. L. FARNWORTH  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced in respect of a charge of theft under the Theft Act 1968, specifically relating to shoplifting offences which took place over a period extending from late 2023 through the early months of 2025, primarily within the Brighton and Hove metropolitan area. This case has been the subject of considerable procedural attention and complexity, as will be outlined in these remarks.

Procedural History  
Your arrest on 5 March 2025 followed the culmination of a multi-faceted investigative operation conducted by the Brighton Metropolitan Police’s Retail Crime Unit in cooperation with the Coastal Business Crime Initiative and local council licensing authorities. This operation was notable for its deployment of intelligence-gathering techniques including analysis of numerous closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems deployed across multiple retail outlets, a practice which continues to invoke debate regarding proportionality and privacy concerns. While such discussions are beyond the court's remit, it is worth acknowledging the tension between effective crime prevention and the safeguarding of civil liberties that increasingly characterises contemporary policing.

Your first appearance in this court was on 15 March 2025, at which time you were legally represented pursuant to a legal aid order. The origins of your representation are themselves a narrative worthy of consideration: the Legal Aid Agency's processing of your representation requests was protracted, requiring two formal hearings to resolve administrative ambiguities pertaining to eligibility criteria. The delays occasioned thereby resulted in the adjournment of the initial plea and trial preparation hearing from 5 April to 26 May 2025.

The court notes with some regret that such delays remain a persistent obstacle to the timely administration of justice. It is no secret that the Legal Aid system is under immense strain, as recognised in recent reports by the Justice Committee. While not directly attributable to the conduct of individual officers or staff, such bottlenecks erode public confidence and can have disproportionate effects on defendants, victims, and witnesses alike.

At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 26 May, you entered a not guilty plea. This plea was maintained until the morning of the trial listed for 14 September 2025, when, following receipt of further evidential material from the Crown, you changed your plea to guilty. The timing of this late plea is unremarkable in the context of acquisitive crime cases, where defendants frequently delay admissions of guilt until the cumulative weight of evidence becomes incontrovertible. This practice, acknowledged within sentencing jurisprudence, warrants consideration when assessing credit for timely remorse and procedural economy.

The Better Case Management (BCM) framework, introduced following the Lord Chief Justice’s 2010 review, seeks to streamline criminal proceedings and ensure the expeditious resolution of cases. In this regard, the accommodation of your trial and subsequent plea change fell within the parameters of expected BCM timescales; however, the intervening delays caused by defence applications for further disclosure and psychiatric evaluation invariably extended the overall timeline.

The court warmly acknowledges the efforts of the Coastal Business Crime Initiative, which has provided victim impact statements and collaborated meaningfully with police and prosecution teams. Their vigilance and sustained engagement with retail premises across the jurisdiction is a testament to public spiritedness and institutional resilience, especially within the context of the current economic pressures on the retail sector. These pressures have been well documented in recent trade publications, which note a pronounced vulnerability to shrinkage and staff burnout exacerbated by the aftereffects of the pandemic and supply chain disruptions.

Similarly, the council’s licensing department furnished reports addressing the implications of retail theft for local business viability, referencing the provisions of the Licensing Act 2003 and associated regulatory frameworks. Though ancillary to the criminal proceedings, such perspectives contribute beneficially to the wider context within which offending takes place.

Experts and Probation Reports  
A pre-sentence report was ordered and provided by probation officer Ms Helen Giddings. The report offers a comprehensive overview of your personal circumstances, background, and risk factors. It notes your current unemployment, residence in temporary accommodation provided by Brighton Housing Trust, and a history of episodic unstable housing. It also observes a lack of engagement with support services, including social welfare advice schemes and mental health outreach programmes currently operating at or near capacity in this area.

Dr Sanjay Mehta, consultant psychiatrist, provided an independent psychiatric evaluation. His detailed and professionally written report characterises your mental health profile as demonstrating features of mild depressive disorder accompanied by elements of impulsivity, though no formal diagnosis of major mental illness or psychosis was established. Dr Mehta remarks on your reluctance to engage consistently with therapeutic interventions and recommends a cautious approach to community-based rehabilitation with frequent monitoring.

Such assessments are invaluable in distilling complex human material into actionable insights, yet the court cautions against over-relying on clinical findings in isolation from behavioural evidence and broader social context. The balancing of therapeutic and protective considerations is a perennial challenge.

In accordance with the principles enunciated in the Sentencing Council’s definitive Theft guideline effective since 2022, the court must weigh aggravating and mitigating factors in adjudicating appropriate disposition. Your previous record, constituting five convictions for shoplifting over a ten-year span, including two conditional discharges and a community order, elevates the seriousness of the present offence. Prior community orders have afforded you the opportunity to desist, but repeated breaches, as documented in probation and police records, indicate limited compliance.

The Crown has relied upon evidence including alarm activation logs, CCTV footage from premises within the Regency Square shopping area, and witness statements from staff and customers. The surveillance material demonstrates sophistication in modus operandi, including the use of distraction techniques and concealment of goods beneath outer garments. Items targeted include electrical accessories, personal care products, and small electronics.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Elevated public concern regarding offences occurring in proximity to vulnerable populations—for example, in retail environments adjacent to schools or shelters—is reflected in sentencing jurisprudence, though no such determinative proximity is present here. The court makes reference, albeit tangentially, to the case of R v. Grayson [2018] EWCA Crim 1111, in which proximity to a youth facility was an aggravating factor in possession charges. No equivalence should be drawn to the present facts, yet such cases serve to illustrate the layered considerations courts navigate.

Victim Impact and Support Services  
The court has before it victim impact statements tendered by the Coastal Retail Partnership on behalf of affected stores. These documents articulate the psychological toll experienced by retail employees, who report heightened anxiety, reduced morale, and considerations to reduce hours or seek transfers. While no direct threat or violence was directed at staff in relation to your offences, the cumulative effect of multiple incidents has fostered an atmosphere of unease.

The Retail Support and Recovery Network, a voluntary charity operating within the region, submitted written representations outlining the systemic challenges faced by shop workers subject to repeated low-level theft. Their insights highlight the widening gap between statutory enforcement capacity and the demands placed on voluntary organisations—particularly in the fields of victim support and crime prevention education.

Furthermore, correspondence from the Brighton Business Improvement District acknowledges collaborative initiatives aimed at community safety and crime reduction, emphasising the delicate balance between enforcement and rehabilitative approaches.

Acknowledgement of the contributions by these bodies is appropriate and reflects a judicial commitment to a holistic appreciation of offending impact beyond mere fiscal loss.

Statutory Framework and Relevant Case Law  
The Theft Act 1968 remains the central statutory provision under which your offending is prosecuted. The elements of the offence, including dishonesty, appropriation, and the intention permanently to deprive, require careful judicial consideration, particularly where repeated conduct suggests calculated rather than opportunistic behaviour.

Sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council in recent years have increasingly emphasised tailored responses, recognising the distinct nature of acquisitive offending patterns. Reflecting on established precedents, the court draws attention to R v. Forster [2020] EWCA Crim 679, where a sentence of 10 months’ custody was affirmed for persistent theft from charity shops involving concealment and deception. While the context differs in some respects, the principle that protracted dishonesty increases culpability holds true.

In R v. Mallon [2019] EWCA Crim 837, the Court reiterated the limited extent to which personal hardship mitigates offending in cases of repeated acquisitive crime, affirming that socio-economic disadvantage does not provide immunity from sanction.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

It is worth recalling, at some length, the guidance on guilty plea credit articulated in R v. Hayes [2023] EWCA Crim 1572, which underscores that credit is not a simple entitlement, especially where pleas are entered at late stages in proceedings, depriving the court and victims of the procedural benefits of early acceptance of responsibility.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Further, the court notes the importance of proportionality in sentencing, balancing deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection, as detailed in the preamble to the Sentencing Council’s Theft guideline and upheld in numerous appellate decisions.

Additional Observations on Public Services and Institutional Performance  
It has come to the court’s attention that the Probation Service in Brighton and Hove, as with many jurisdictions nationwide, is facing chronic understaffing and case overload, a matter documented extensively in the Ministry of Justice quarterly workforce reports. These systemic pressures inevitably limit the scope and frequency of offender supervision and engagement. It is acknowledged that probation officers operate under increasingly challenging conditions, striving to maintain caseloads sometimes exceeding recommended maximums.

Similarly, mental health services within the local NHS trust have reported unprecedented demand, resulting in extended waiting times for initial psychosocial assessments and limits on follow-up interventions. Dr Mehta's report correctly places your lack of engagement within this systemic framework, though, as noted, individual responsibility remains paramount.

The trial experienced a further procedural delay when an urgent application was made on 8 July 2025 for the attendance of an intermediary to assist with communication challenges identified by your legal team. The court accommodated this request in the interest of fairness, rescheduling the trial to September. While this adjournment ensured compliance with your rights under the Equality Act 2010, it also highlights the complex interface between criminal justice procedures and accessibility requirements.

The court also records appreciation for courtroom staff and ushers who have adapted to recent refurbishment works within Courtroom 5, including the installation of enhanced audio-visual facilities for evidence presentation.

It is noteworthy that no media representatives attended the hearings despite the public’s right to open justice. This absence reflects a wider trend identified in research on media coverage of acquisitive crime, which often favours dramatic or violent offences at the expense of more mundane yet socially consequential matters.

Finally, reference is made to a letter submitted on your behalf by a youth charity, ‘Bright Futures,’ advocating for community-based sentencing options that would facilitate engagement with educational and vocational programmes. While the court welcomes such proposals, any determinations on their suitability await fuller consideration, including the forthcoming pre-sentence report.

As to legal representation, Counsel for the defence, Mr Dean Whitaker, has presented timely, cogent submissions in mitigation, emphasising your personal vulnerabilities, financial hardship, and the potential for rehabilitation outside custody. Crown counsel, Ms Ingrid Lawson, has responded with balanced argument, acknowledging difficulties faced by defendants while affirming the necessity of appropriate deterrent measures.

It cannot be overstated that acquisitive offending, while often framed in terms of necessity or survival, undermines the fabric of consumer trust and disrupts the livelihoods of small businesses. The cost of shrinkage is borne not just in sterling sums but in reduced staff morale and community cohesion.

This court is, regrettably, well acquainted with criminal cases exhibiting complex constellations of socio-economic deprivation, mental health challenges, and persistent offending. The judicial role in these matters requires navigating competing interests and imperatives, a task made more difficult by systemic resource constraints and procedural complexities.

The court has examined a number of precedents, some of considerable gravity and involving much higher levels of culpability. For instance, in R v. Henderson [2023] EWCA Crim 2254, an immediate custodial sentence was upheld where the defendant committed aggravated burglary inflicting actual bodily harm. While obviously not on all fours with the present case, such authorities demonstrate the gradations of seriousness courts must calibrate.

Similarly, the Court recalls R v. Faulkner [2021] EWCA Crim 365, concerning possession of a bladed article in a school car park, underscoring the harshness of sentences where public safety is imminently threatened by reckless conduct.

Historical overview of the Theft Act 1968 notes the evolution from common law theft to codified statutory provisions, including successive amendments meant to accommodate modern retail environments, digital commerce, and expanded definitions of proprietary rights.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}. {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

The behavioural analysis contained within the probation report highlights recurring impulsivity, periods of employment interrupted by substance abuse, and associations with peers engaged in petty criminality. Similar dynamics were explored in R v. Phillips [2020] EWCA Crim 1098, a case concerning scrap metal theft, where social embeddedness in offending networks contributed to recidivism.

Notably, the court has considered letters of support from family members and community organisations. While these attest to facets of your character and suggest latent potential, they cannot be viewed as overriding the legal imperatives incumbent on this court.

The cumulative nature of your conduct, seen in the context of prior court interventions, compels an approach that balances rehabilitation with accountability.

In conclusion, the court recognises your plea of guilty and any expression of remorse that may accompany it, but notes its late timing and limited manifestation prior to trial preparation. Credit will accordingly be applied within the recognised judicial framework.

Sentencing options remain open pending receipt of the final probation assessment, with particular attention to identifying whether community orders incorporating rehabilitative programming may suitably address underlying factors and reduce further criminality.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, section 108, and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
