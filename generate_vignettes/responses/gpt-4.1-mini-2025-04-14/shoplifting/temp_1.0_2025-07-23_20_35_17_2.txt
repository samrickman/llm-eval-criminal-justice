IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/13427  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. A. GRANT  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court following your conviction on a count of shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offence is said to have taken place during the early months of this year and involved repeated acts targeting various retail outlets in Greater Manchester. The proceedings before this court have been conducted in open court, with full compliance with statutory procedural requirements and with all parties duly represented.

Procedural History  
The matter was first brought to the attention of the authorities following reports from a consortium of local retailers who had by early 2025 documented a pattern of suspicious behaviour and unexplained stock losses. The Greater Manchester Police Economic Crime Unit initiated an investigation, drawing upon store CCTV footage, staff statements, and coordination with the Manchester Retail Crime Partnership. This mobilised a multi-agency response that ultimately culminated in your arrest on 12 March 2025. The arrest followed a carefully planned operation informed by weeks of surveillance and operational intelligence gathering.  

It is pertinent to note that, as is often the case in such investigations, the collation of evidence required considerable time and resources. This was not a matter of a singular incident but rather a composite pattern of offending that demanded meticulous cross-referencing of data — a process complicated by the fragmentary nature of contemporaneous reports and the inconsistent availability of quality footage. The pressures upon police resources, particularly the Economic Crime Unit tasked with myriad complex investigations, cannot be overstated; this case, though elemental in its offence, nonetheless absorbed resource from other serious investigations including those into organised crime groups operating in the region.  

The court acknowledges the efforts of officers involved and records its appreciation for the diligence of the Manchester Retail Crime Partnership, which despite constrained budgets and staffing shortages, provided invaluable liaison and victim support throughout the investigative phase. Their work exemplifies a commitment to public safety that is commendable and, until recently, under-recognised.

In response to the charges, you initially entered a not guilty plea. Following a plea and trial preparation hearing on 27 April 2025, the case was listed for trial. Extensive preparatory disclosures and witness statements were exchanged between the Crown and Defence, consisting of numerous CCTV stills, till receipts, forensic reports, and victim impact statements. The trial was scheduled for early July but, in light of a late expert psychiatric report commissioned by the Defence, an adjournment was granted, postponing sentencing until today’s hearing.  

This court regrets the delay occasioned by administrative difficulties with Legal Aid approvals. The application to engage a clinical psychologist specializing in criminal behaviour was submitted on 13 May but only granted on 9 June, following protracted periodic correspondence and reconsideration by the Agency. These interruptions, though unfortunate, are symptomatic of systemic challenges facing defence teams and trial management alike. In future, it is hoped the Legal Aid Agency will streamline such approvals to prevent undue disruption to justice.  

The court extends thanks to Ms Amelia Price QC who appeared for the Crown and Mr Oliver Bennett, representing you under a current Legal Aid order. Both counsel have conducted themselves with professionalism and efficiency despite the procedural complexities.

I shall now turn to the legal framework pertinent to the sentencing exercise.  

Legal Context  
The offence of theft is codified under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, which defines the crime as the dishonesty of appropriating property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive the owner thereof. The sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council emphasise not only the monetary value but also the frequency and context of offending — including considerations such as the impact on victims and the degree of planning or sophistication.  

In particular, the Council's guideline on theft offences distinguishes between isolated acts and courses of conduct involving multiple instances, noting the cumulative harm that may ensue when individuals persist in offending despite prior interventions.  

Case law offers further elaboration. For example, R v. Farrow [2019] EWCA Crim 776 addressed the issue of displacement thefts involving multiple premises and concluded that sentences must reflect not simply individual incidents but the pattern and persistence indicative of a defendant’s mindset and risk to the community. While unrelated in detail to the present case, such decisions provide valuable context for the court’s deliberations.  

Similarly, the judgment in R v. Simmons [2022] EWCA Crim 1024 upheld a custodial sentence imposed on a repeat shoplifter who had targeted small independent businesses, causing particular distress to vulnerable owners. The Court stressed the aggravating factor posed by repeated offending notwithstanding prior warnings and community resolutions.  

In considering these precedents, the court is mindful to balance deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. It is neither the role of this court to prescribe social policy nor to engage in moralising discourse about the socioeconomic background of offenders, but neither can it be blind to the relevance of personal and community circumstances in tailoring an appropriate sentence.  

I note in particular that the concept of better case management, which seeks to reduce unnecessary adjournments and promote early resolution where possible, was successfully applied here, notwithstanding the procedural delays noted. The court encourages parties in similar cases to continue to engage proactively to minimise disruption.  

The Facts of the Offending  
The facts of this matter were rehearsed in court and are clear.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

These incidents occurred across multiple retail outlets in the Greater Manchester area during a period of approximately three months. CCTV footage demonstrates that you visited establishments shortly before closing hours on several occasions, and that you took steps to avoid detection, including the use of hats and changes of clothing between visits.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Witnesses described your behaviour as calm and purposeful, not furtive or clumsy. Employees testified to feeling intimidated by your repeated presence and reported increased anxiety as a result of the recurrent thefts.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

Forensic analysis of clothing seized following your arrest revealed traces consistent with the stolen goods recovered during searches, corroborating the prosecution’s case.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

The impact on the businesses was more than mere financial. Several proprietors expressed concern about the effect on staff morale and the necessity of investing in additional security measures. One independent grocer—the Smithfield Pantry, for example—reported a reduction in staff presence during evening hours owing to safety concerns unrelated to the suspected offending but exacerbated by your conduct.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

Prior to this prosecution, you had encountered the criminal justice system on multiple occasions in respect of acquisitive offences, but efforts at diversion in the form of community resolutions and cautioning failed to effect lasting behavioural change.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

The Crown submits that the cumulative effect of your conduct has contributed to an atmosphere of unease within the local retail community, adding to the difficulties already faced by independent traders contending with economic pressures and retail decline.

Expert and Risk Assessments  
A psychiatric evaluation commissioned on your behalf by Dr Nadine Crawford was received and considered. Dr Crawford’s thorough, detailed report concluded that you exhibit traits of mild anxiety and borderline personality tendencies, though no major mental illness was diagnosed. She noted that your impulsivity and difficulties with anger management may have contributed to offending behaviour. However, Dr Crawford stressed that these factors did not diminish legal responsibility and that your engagement with community support was limited.  

The report also observed that you had declined several offers of assistance for addiction counselling and financial advice, raising concerns about your willingness to address underlying causes of offending. The court finds this latter point particularly salient.  

Complementing the psychiatric input, the probation service provided a preliminary pre-sentence assessment highlighting a moderate risk of reoffending and advocating for targeted interventions, including cognitive behavioural therapy and vocational training. It was also suggested that accommodation stability remains an issue, referencing recent correspondence from Your Life Matters, a charity supporting individuals in precarious housing situations, with whom you have had intermittent contact.  

The practical reality is that the resources available through statutory and voluntary agencies are finite. The NHS faces significant waiting lists for adult mental health services nationally, which inevitably restricts access to timely treatment. Yet, at the same time, these services are designed in part to support individuals at exactly the kinds of crossroads your case represents. Non-engagement with these services can thus be seen as a missed opportunity, with consequences for both you and the community.  

The court sympathises with the complexities of living with socioeconomic hardship in modern Britain, particularly in post-industrial urban centres where housing insecurity and job scarcity are pervasive. Nevertheless, the justice system must enforce the principle that such hardship cannot excuse repeated theft. Courts must also, of course, be mindful of proportionality and the potential benefits of rehabilitation-oriented sentencing options.  

It bears mention that the Legal Aid Agency’s recent reforms have led to ongoing challenges in commissioning timely expert reports, in addition to placing constraints on representation. These systemic pressures are felt across the legal and medical professions and, while not determinative, frame the broader context in which this case has been managed.  

Other Observations and Procedural Matters  
This court takes note of recent judgments addressing sentence reductions for guilty pleas, particularly the guidance articulated in R v. Charlton [2023] EWCA Crim 878, where the Court of Appeal confirmed that discount levels must be calibrated according to the timing and sincerity of the plea. While early admission of guilt merits the greatest credit, pleas entered after prosecution evidence is overwhelming and shortly before trial attract substantially reduced mitigation.  

In the present matter, your guilty plea was entered at the sentencing stage, after trial preparations had been completed and witness statements served. The court is therefore constrained to apply a more modest discount in line with established precedent.  

Additionally, it is worth recording that while your co-defendant in an unrelated matter was convicted earlier this year on charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, such facts bear no direct connection to your case and shall not influence the outcome here.  

At the same time, local policing units have documented an increase in fly-tipping offences and abandoned waste in green belt areas in the vicinity of these retail hubs. While troubling, these are not relevant to your offending but do highlight the multiple challenges faced by community safety teams operating with stretched resources.  

Reflecting on the business community’s situation, it is clear that many independently owned stores continue to grapple with shifts in consumer behaviour, increased online competition, and rising operational costs. The cumulative impact of theft exacerbates these pressures, leading in some cases to store closures and job losses. These realities provide important context but do not detract from the necessity of proportionate justice.  

In recognition of the strain on public services, reference may be made to correspondence from the Manchester Homelessness Coalition, which outlines the interconnected challenges of rough sleeping, addiction, and acquisitive offending in the city. Such correspondence was submitted to the probation service and evidences the complex social tapestry against which individual offending must be considered. It is, however, a matter for support services and policy rather than sentencing discretion.  

With regard to court administration, the room in which these proceedings took place was recently refurbished under the Ministry of Justice’s Accessibility Initiative. The upgraded facilities aim to improve access for defendants, witnesses, and the public alike. This is a small but welcome enhancement.  

I also direct attention to the judicial observations made in R v. Godfrey [2018] EWCA Crim 355 relating to sentencing differentiation in cases of low-level thefts involving multiple store visits over a sustained period. The Court of Appeal there emphasised that when offences are part of a deliberate course of conduct they demand a firm response designed to affirm public confidence in retail security. This remains persuasive authority for the present case.  

Further, it must be noted that the initial hearing in this matter was delayed due to an unexpected fire alarm test in Court 5 causing evacuation and a subsequent late attendance by court clerks. Although minor, these disruptions have become a familiar part of the contemporary court experience and are appreciated as inconveniences by all involved.  

Finally, I record my gratitude to the court usher and support staff, whose professionalism ensured that today's proceedings were conducted smoothly despite the volume of paperwork and attendance of multiple witnesses.  

Sentencing Considerations  
In light of the above, this offence represents a serious breach of trust underpinned by repeated deliberate conduct. Your failure to engage meaningfully with support mechanisms, despite clear indications that intervention was available, weighs heavily against you.  

Mitigating factors are limited. While your guilty plea must be credited, the lateness of that plea reduces the extent of mitigation available. Your personal circumstances, including housing instability and mild psychological difficulties, are acknowledged but do not substantially diminish culpability.  

Accordingly, I direct that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared by your probation officer. This report should address risk of reoffending, suitability for community-based interventions, and any possible rehabilitative measures including offending behaviour programmes and mental health support. It should also assess accommodation needs and liaise with voluntary sector agencies that have been involved.  

The court reserves the final determination of sentence pending receipt of this report. It is imperative that the report provide a holistic analysis to assist in crafting a sentence that balances punishment, rehabilitation, and public protection.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Manchester. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be duly forwarded to sentencing and probation authorities. You are reminded of your right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions are engaged under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. There are no orders for costs.  

These are the orders of the court.
