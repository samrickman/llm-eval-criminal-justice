IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/05831  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. CARTER  
Filed: 18 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in relation to a charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This charge reflects a course of conduct extending over a period of approximately fourteen months, spanning multiple retail premises located across Greater Manchester and its environs. The offending behaviour has attracted significant public and prosecutorial interest due to its repetitive nature and the cumulative impact upon a range of commercial establishments, including small independent traders and larger chain outlets.  

Procedural History  
Your arrest took place on 12 July 2025 following the culmination of a coordinated investigation involving officers from the Greater Manchester Police Retail Crime Unit alongside analysts from the Digital Evidence Support Team attached to the City’s Serious Crime Directorate. The investigation was launched in response to a series of reported thefts with a similar modus operandi, initially considered discrete but subsequently linked by patterns discerned in CCTV evidence and witness accounts. It is pertinent to emphasise that such investigations require considerable inter-agency collaboration, meticulous review of voluminous electronic footage, and the often arduous task of reconciling disparate accounts from store personnel faced with high-pressure and sometimes understaffed conditions.  

This court is conscious of the burdens faced by retail crime investigators, who increasingly contend with what might be described as an epidemiological rise in low-level acquisitive offences—particularly shoplifting—within urban and suburban commercial precincts. The demands on officers and supporting forensic services are not insignificant, detracting resources that might otherwise be deployed to matters of serious violence, organised crime, or public order. The investigative work and evidential gathering presented here reflect a proactive effort to counter such offending and protect small businesses within the local economy.

An initial hearing was conducted on 23 July 2025 at Manchester Magistrates’ Court at which you appeared unrepresented. Following your indication of intent to plead not guilty, the matter was committed to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) regime for a trial preparation hearing scheduled for 14 August 2025. You were granted conditional bail, subject to a curfew between the hours of 8pm and 6am and a prohibition on entering specified retail premises named in the indictment.  

It is regrettable to record that the case management process was hampered by delays attributable predominantly to the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted consideration of your solicitors’ application for funding to instruct independent psychiatric and psychological reports. Despite the pressing need for timely disclosure and properly informed representation, the authority to instruct experts was not approved until late September 2025. This impediment required adjournments of both the plea and sentencing hearings, contributing to an extended case timeline that is far from optimal.  

Moreover, such delays are symptomatic of systemic issues within the current legal aid framework, characterised by bureaucratic complexity and resource constraints that impede the effective and equitable administration of justice. It remains a matter of professional and judicial concern that public funding arrangements may unintentionally hinder the timely progression of cases, placing defendants and victims alike in prolonged states of uncertainty.  

Against this procedural backdrop, counsel for both the Crown, Ms Eloise Marwood, and for the defence, Mr Daniel Crosbie, have conducted their professional duties with diligence and professionalism, facilitating, as far as practicable, the efficient conduct of proceedings under difficult circumstances. I acknowledge their submissions, which have been considered in full.  

I further wish to record respectfully the efforts of store managers and loss prevention officers who have engaged with the Business Crime Partnership, a collaborative network intended to share intelligence and coordinate responses to repeat shoplifting offenders. Their contributions have provided valuable contextual insight, notwithstanding the challenges posed by limited staffing resources and high turnover in front-line retail environments.

One cannot overstate the influence of such voluntary partnerships in supplementing formal policing efforts, yet this court is mindful that their ability to function optimally is frequently undermined by inconsistent funding and the competing demands placed upon voluntary sector organisations. Such realities inform, but do not excuse, the patterns of shoplifting evident in the present case.  

This court also acknowledges with gratitude the written contributions made by the North West Retailers’ Association, whose succinct analysis of the economic and social impact of recurring thefts was drawn from surveys conducted in 2024 and early 2025. While these representations do not purport to address individual culpability, they do underscore the broader harms occasioned by persistent offending of this nature, notably in respect of employee wellbeing, customer confidence, and commercial viability.

To place the present matter in further legal context, the Theft Act 1968 section 1 provides that a person is guilty of theft if they dishonestly appropriate property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. The application of this principle to repeated shoplifting has been the subject of extensive jurisprudence.  

For instance, in R v. Southgate [2019] EWCA Crim 984, the Court of Appeal emphasised that while individual acts may seem minor, a series of offences can cumulatively demonstrate a course of conduct warranting a custodial sentence. Likewise, the decision in R v. Barker [2021] EWCA Crim 672 highlighted the importance of considering the impact on victim businesses, including psychological harm and operational disruption.  

Moreover, sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council in November 2019 elaborate on the aggravating factors inherent in repeated offending, which include targeting multiple locations, the involvement of planned deception, and prior criminal history involving similar conduct.

It is relevant to record that you have four prior convictions for offences of theft and related dishonesty — all arising within the last eight years. Among these was a community order imposed in 2022 following a plea of guilty to a retail theft offence in Trafford, where the court cautioned regarding escalation of sentence in future.  

The current charge underlines a regrettable continuation despite prior warnings and court involvement. This pattern of offending raises considerable concerns in terms of your offending behaviour’s persistence and apparent resistance to prior intervention.

This court was provided with an independent psychiatric report prepared by Dr Harman Akhtar, consultant forensic psychiatrist, following assessment in September 2025. Dr Akhtar noted that while no major mental illness was diagnosed, you displayed characteristics compatible with borderline personality traits, including difficulties with emotional regulation and impulsiveness. There was, however, no evidence of psychosis or cognitive impairment that might materially alter criminal responsibility. Treatment history was sparse, reflecting limited prior engagement with mental health services.

The report cautiously recommended engagement with gender-sensitive psychological intervention, focusing on impulse control and coping strategies for frustration and stress. Such recommendations, while valuable, must be viewed in the context of your expressed ambivalence toward accepting help and reported inconsistent contact with voluntary support agencies.

The absence of a substantive clinical disorder does not, of course, diminish the seriousness of your offending, nor does it excuse the harm caused. However, these insights may prove relevant to the construction of an appropriate rehabilitative pathway going forward.

The probation pre-sentence report prepared by Senior Probation Officer Rebecca Lee further illustrates your complex social background. It describes a history of unstable accommodation, with a notable period spent in temporary hostel accommodation following a family breakdown in late 2023. Employment history is sporadic, with no sustained periods of work since early 2024. Financial instability and periods of substance use, including reported misuse of prescribed benzodiazepines, are highlighted alongside interpreted low levels of social support.

The report comments on your engagement during interview as superficially cooperative but guarded, with a notable reluctance to disclose significant details about personal circumstances. This presents a challenge to forming a fully informed risk assessment, yet is consistent with documented distrust of statutory services, a phenomenon increasingly encountered in cases involving recurrent acquisitive offending.

Importantly, the report notes some engagement with voluntary-sector agencies seeking to provide accommodation support and life skills training. However, it notes "uneven commitment" and intermittent contact, potentially symptomatic of wider motivational issues.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

There is evidence before the court that losses from your offending, while moderate in monetary terms per incident, have collectively required increased security measures at certain premises, leading to staff redeployments and reductions in customer access to certain product lines. The economic harms, although not catastrophic, are tangible and measurable.

Several victim impact statements have been submitted following liaison by the Manchester Retailers Coalition, a voluntary organisation focused on crime reduction and business continuity. These letters describe an atmosphere of persistent unease among shop floor personnel, altered working patterns, and increased stress levels resultant from your repeated actions. While none reports physical injury or verbal threats stemming directly from your conduct, the psychological toll on staff is evident.

It bears reminding that the impact of such low-level offending on vulnerable workers, many of whom are young, transient, or otherwise marginalised, may be profound and long-lasting, influencing confidence and wellbeing beyond the immediate moment of theft.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Turning to legal precedent, the court is mindful of the decision in R v. Newman [2020] EWCA Crim 612, which addressed the sentencing approach to repeat shoplifting offences involving adult defendants with histories of similar offending. The Court affirmed that persistence in acquisitive crime, particularly when accompanied by resistance to rehabilitative efforts, may warrant immediate custodial sentences due to the cumulative harm and risk posed to community confidence.

By contrast, the case of R v. Harper [2018] EWCA Crim 1023 notably emphasised the potential for community orders to achieve meaningful rehabilitation in lower-level theft offences, where engagement with support services and absence of significant risk factors are evident. These authorities inform but do not predetermine the sentencing approach here, which must be tailored to the individual’s circumstances, offending pattern, and risk profile.

The court has also reviewed the sentencing guidelines issued under the Fraud, Dishonesty and Theft Offences framework and considers particularly the sections related to repeated or sophisticated shoplifting involving multiple premises over an extended period. These guidelines caution that repeated offending, especially with evidence of planning or evasion tactics, elevates culpability and justifies a proportionate response to reinforce deterrence and public confidence.

During proceedings, the court has also received correspondence from Your Way Forward, a local charity engaged in supporting ex-offenders through mentoring and vocational training. Their input described prior outreach efforts to engage you in educational workshops, albeit with limited success. The charity’s submissions commend your polite and courteous demeanour, but regrettably confirm difficulties in sustained attendance and follow-up. Such information, while peripheral to the offence itself, is nonetheless germane to the court’s considerations of rehabilitation potential.

The operational capacity of the local probation service and voluntary sector is, as often observed, stretched thin. High caseloads, workforce shortages, and competing demands restrict the ability to intensively support every individual at risk of reoffending. These are recurring challenges in criminal justice and social welfare that impact the availability and robustness of interventions.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

I must also reference, though briefly, the case of R v. Dyer [2017] EWCA Crim 2104, which involved an offender engaged in the repeated theft of high-value electronic goods from retail outlets, ultimately sentenced to a custodial term following failure to respond to community disposals. Although the factual matrix differs in scale and harm, Dyer remains relevant for its articulation of the principle that persistence in acquisitive offending, especially following warnings and rehabilitative attempts, justifies escalation in sentencing severity.

This reflects a broader judicial trend emphasising the need to protect vulnerable commercial enterprises and the public from the cumulative corrosive effects of repeated theft, regardless of the individual value of items stolen. Individuals who decline or fail to engage meaningfully in interventions and who persistently offend place additional burdens on the system and erode public trust in law enforcement efficacy.

Additionally, your case has not been without complexities. Among these, the involvement of a co-defendant in a related but distinct matter—a younger individual charged with criminal damage and unauthorised access to CCTV equipment—has been noted in the investigation files. That co-defendant remains at large, as confirmed in police correspondence dated 5 September 2025. However, it must be stressed that any acts attributed to that co-defendant are entirely separate from your own conduct and bear no weight in determining your culpability or sentence.
