IN THE CROWN COURT AT CLIFTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. C2025/08419  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. Wentworth  
Filed: 19 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence concerning a course of offending involving theft from retail premises, one count, alleged under the Theft Act 1968, section 1. This offending spans from May 2023 to April 2025, with incidents taking place in the Clifton city centre and its suburban commercial periphery. Your pattern of repeat shoplifting has attracted the attention of police and multi-agency partners owing to both the frequency and persistence of the conduct.

Procedural Background  
You were arrested on 15 April 2025 following an investigation led by Clifton City Police in coordination with the Business Crime Reduction Taskforce. The operation, initiated in early March, relied heavily on collaboration with retail security managers, CCTV analysis, and a series of targeted patrols. The police case file, comprising over 400 pages including CCTV stills, witness statements, and forensic reports, was submitted in accordance with criminal procedural mandates. Upon arrest, you were interviewed under caution; initial denial gave way to an eventual change of plea before trial proceedings commenced. This court acknowledges the cooperation of both prosecution and defence counsel throughout these pre-trial phases under the Better Case Management regime. There was an initial listing for the plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) scheduled for 8 July, subsequently adjourned at the request of defence counsel to permit the completion of a psychiatric evaluation.

The evolution of court structures, from magistrates' courts to the establishment of Crown Courts such as this one, represents an essential tier for offences bearing significant public and penal gravity. This court is acutely aware of the increasing caseload pressures confronting judicial officers nationally — an issue exacerbated by staffing shortages within both court staffing and probation services. Recent reforms, including the progressive rollout of digital case management systems and remote hearings, have somewhat alleviated these pressures but have not eliminated them. The retention of judicial discretion and the fundamental principles of open justice ensure that cases like yours receive thorough and transparent consideration.

It is not without regret that the court must again register concern regarding the protracted process of securing Legal Aid funding for expert reports. The counsel appearing on your behalf, Mr Andrew Collins, has at multiple stages had to issue formal reminders and inquiries to the Legal Aid Agency concerning the instruction of a forensic psychologist with experience in acquisitive offending behaviours. The delays experienced here, amounting to over six weeks between application and approval, represent a regrettable deficiency in case progression and raise questions about the current administrative efficacy of publicly funded defence resources. Such systemic inefficiencies inevitably risk compromising timely access to justice, something this court must guard against zealously.

In mitigation, the defence has submitted three statements from community workers affiliated with the Clifton Street Outreach Project, an organisation offering assistance to individuals facing social exclusion, substance misuse challenges, and unstable housing. Those statements outline your intermittent engagement with such support, highlighting sporadic attendance at drop-in sessions and a general ambivalence regarding longer-term intervention.

Multi-Agency Engagement  
It should be noted that this matter has involved a degree of coordination between various local services beyond the police and courts. The Clifton Business Crime Reduction Taskforce convened a stakeholder meeting on 31 March 2025, which included attendance by representatives of the local Safer Neighbourhoods Team, the probation service, community housing officers, and Retailers Against Crime (RAC). This collective reviewed incident reports, encompassing CCTV footage, store loss summaries, and behavioural observations. An intelligence report dated 10 April 2025 summarises these inputs and recommends tailored intervention strategies addressing repeat offending in retail settings. While such meetings are resource-intensive, they serve an important role in promoting informed responses and support for both victims and offenders.

I am conscious of the often-overlooked workload borne by retail staff and security personnel in processing and reporting instances of shoplifting. Particularly in busy urban centres, such staff face elevated demands, often compounded by low pay and limited institutional recognition. Retail Worker Wellbeing assessments prepared by the Clifton Retail Partnership, submitted under separate cover, commend the resilience of these workers despite recurring reports of verbal abuse and intimidation from some offenders. These observations, while peripheral to your individual case, provide important context in understanding the downstream effects of repeat theft.

It falls to this court to balance those societal costs against the rehabilitative prospects for defendants such as yourself. The probation service, despite widespread caseload pressures, has endeavoured to provide a comprehensive pre-sentence report. I shall return to that later in these remarks.

Relevant Legal Context  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, under which you were charged, sets the fundamental parameters for offences of dishonest appropriation of property, with intent to permanently deprive. While shoplifting can, in single, low-value cases, be attended to summarily, persistent and deliberate thefts across multiple premises, which cause cumulative harm, attract the full weight of criminal sanction.

The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, updated in 2022, provides a framework for assessing culpability and harm, taking account of the nature of the offence, the value of stolen goods, any breach of trust or exploitation of vulnerability, and the impact on victims, including staff and business owners. The guideline also emphasises the importance of considering offender mitigation, including early guilty plea, personal circumstances, and likelihood of rehabilitation.

Judicial consideration of late pleas is orthodox, as set out in recent authority. In R v. Penhale [2023] EWCA Crim 1192, the court emphasised that not all guilty pleas are equal, with the timing often dictating the level of credit. For example, pleas entered only at trial may warrant reduced discount, reflecting the increased burden placed on victims, witnesses, and the court system. Though Penhale concerned fraud offences, the principle of assessing plea timing is apposite here.

This court also recalls the decision in R v. Wilkes [2021] EWCA Crim 897, involving a repeat offender convicted of vehicle theft. Wilkes held that repeated offending demonstrates a degree of volitional persistence and challenges the assumption of spontaneous lapse, increasing culpability. Though the offences differ in modality, the broader principle of weighing offending pattern remains significant.

Parallel to these cases, I note the judgment in R v. Chambers [2020] EWCA Crim 1546, where the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence for a defendant who repeatedly trespassed and stole from community allotment sites, leading to sustained distress among vulnerable participants, including elderly volunteers. This case serves as a distant comparative example of how non-violent property offences can nonetheless injure social cohesion and community trust.

On the statutory front, reference is made to the amendments made by the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which influence the determination of sentence length and structure, including custodial thresholds and the consideration of community sentences. The integration of Rehabilitation Activity Requirements (RARs) and unpaid work obligations is routinely considered alongside bespoke interventions such as Cognitive Skills Programmes.

It is worth noting that the legal and institutional landscape within which this offence and its adjudication occur is complex and mutable. The Criminal Procedure Rules, under Part 5, mandate the accuracy and accessibility of transcripts and court recordings, ensuring transparency and preserving procedural justice. The Law Commission’s ongoing consultation on sentencing reform, due for publication later this year, may, in future, alter the frameworks within which courts operate, though that is not presently determinative for the matter at hand.

Victim Impact and Retail Sector Response  
Victim impact statements submitted from two affected retail establishments underscore the strain placed on their operational capacity, staff morale, and financial viability. While not presenting direct physical harm, the repeated thefts have induced a climate of unease and precaution, including the introduction of additional security measures and changes to staff rotas. One manager noted an increase in employee turnover and difficulty recruiting part-time staff due in part to the stress engendered by the ongoing risk of theft and confrontation.

These concerns echo findings by the Retail Safety Alliance, a voluntary sector body, which notes that retail crime impacts multifarious dimensions of staff wellbeing, business resilience, and customer confidence. The phenomenon of 'shrinkage'—loss of stock through theft or mismanagement—is a significant economic factor, with national estimates placing annual losses in the billions.

Furthermore, the ongoing repercussions extend beyond immediate retail losses. The societal cost includes the redirection of police resources and business investment away from community development toward security measures. It is unsurprising, then, that the Home Office-funded Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP) continues to prioritise intelligence-led policing and multi-agency collaboration in this area. This case forms part of that continuous effort.

In a somewhat tangential vein, I acknowledge the strategic guidance issued by the Ministry of Justice in their February 2024 policy paper on 'Community Engagement and Crime Prevention,' which speaks to integrating voluntary and statutory bodies to mitigate low-level acquisitive crime through proactive engagement. While those broad imperatives are difficult to translate into individual sentencing decisions, they provide a backdrop to the wider context of the case.

Prior to detailing the specific offending conduct, it is necessary to address certain points of clarification in case management. There was an administrative delay occasioned by an unexpected shortage of court clerks and interpreter services in May 2025, which postponed the final plea hearing by a fortnight. At no time did this materially prejudice the defence’s preparedness.

The defendant’s handwriting, submitted in several letters to the court, is distinctive — meticulous, neat, and legibly formatted. While this observation may seem digressive, it reflects a degree of personal orderliness potentially relevant to risk assessment.

The probation report, compiled by Officer Rebecca Mitchelson, is comprehensive. It outlines your background, personal history, offending behaviour, and social circumstances. I express gratitude to Ms Mitchelson and to Dr Gerard Somerville, the independent forensic psychologist who performed the psychiatric assessment, both of whom have provided detailed and professionally rigorous contributions. Their reports, although lengthy, assist the court in tailoring appropriate sentencing measures.

The psychiatric assessment found no evidence of major mental illness or severe personality disorder but noted tendencies towards impulsivity, situational anxiety, and mild polysubstance use. That said, the report comments on your fluctuations in engagement with support services and warns of potential relapse into offending absent active intervention. It recommends, cautiously, a structured community sentence with specialized cognitive behavioural therapy to address offending cognitions and behavioural triggers.

In considering the facts of the offending, I am conscious that the case must be viewed holistically. The pattern of your conduct, timing, and choice of locations demonstrates a degree of premeditation and deliberate intent.

A collateral observation: contemporaneous to your offences, Clifton City Police continued their investigation into an unrelated matter involving a co-defendant in a separate burglary offense on 7 June 2024. That co-defendant, now at large and charged with criminal damage to a church noticeboard during the same incident, stands outside the scope of this trial and your responsibility. Such distinctions between defendants, especially where names and locations coincide, underscore the necessity of precision in legal adjudication.

The matter of co-defendants is occasionally pertinent. However, in your case, you act alone. There was no evidence of collaboration, conspiracy, or involvement in complex or organised theft rings. No charges related to possession of bladed articles on school premises or drug trafficking were brought or proven.

The court notes also that, in February 2024, an unrelated roommate of yours was found in possession of cannabis during a police search for weapons in a separate matter. The roommate’s prior record and conduct have no bearing on your offences or culpability, but were reviewed in safeguarding assessments.

The use of surveillance technology in this case, including mobile device geolocation and integrated CCTV systems, reflects wider advances in policing methodology. It also imposes stringent requirements on data protection and investigative ethics, particularly in the context of judicial oversight.

The public discussion often fractures between those who view surveillance as an indispensable tool for crime prevention and civil libertarians wary of privacy infringement. This case falls squarely in the former camp, given judicial authorisation and proportionality.

Further afield, I acknowledge that around this time, the Probation Service nationally has faced systemic staff shortages, with vacancy rates estimated at 12% and corresponding increases in caseload sizes. This reality underscores the immense challenge faced by officers tasked with supervising and rehabilitating offenders exhibiting complex needs, such as those manifest in your case.
