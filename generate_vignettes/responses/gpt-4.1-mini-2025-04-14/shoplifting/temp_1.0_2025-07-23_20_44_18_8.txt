IN THE CROWN COURT AT HUNTINGDON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14398  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. HARWOOD  
Filed: 16 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear for sentence before this Crown Court, charged with offences under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, concerning a course of conduct amounting to shoplifting in multiple retail outlets within the Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire area. The offending behaviour, as outlined in the indictment, spans a period extending from November 2023 through June 2025.

Procedural History  
Your case first came before the Magistrates’ Court at St Neots on 12 July 2025, a date notable both for its sweltering heat and the ongoing strike action affecting court staff in the East of England. This strike action precipitated unavoidable delays in administrative processing and hearing listings across this jurisdiction. Your initial appearance was adjourned on that occasion, a procedural necessity that regrettably extended the pre-trial period by several weeks. On 16 August 2025, you entered a not guilty plea and were remanded on conditional bail subject to a curfew between 7pm and 7am. 

It must be noted that subsequent case management hearings, scheduled on 5 September and 10 October respectively, were impacted by changes in court list availability, with marked effects on the pace at which this matter progressed. The Better Case Management (BCM) arrangements, designed to expedite and streamline cases such as yours, operated with some measure of success—though not without the typical fragilities attendant upon resource constraints and competing judicial priorities. 

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) offered substantial disclosure on 2 October 2025, including witness statements from retail staff, CCTV footage, and analysis of recovered property. Your legal representatives applied for a forensic psychiatric report to clarify mental health status and potential mitigating factors, an application granted by the court following correspondence between defence solicitors and the Legal Aid Agency, itself subject to multiple rounds of administrative review and appeal from 12 August through 8 September 2025. The delays in funding authorisation of the psychiatric assessment have nonetheless been satisfactorily resolved with a report submitted by Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist Dr. Lorna Whitfield on 14 October 2025, for which the court is grateful.

The case came on for plea and sentence hearing before this court on 16 October, at which you entered a guilty plea on the basis of the evidence served. This plea, while appropriately acknowledged, came after prolonged pre-trial proceedings. Whilst not a breach of your procedural rights, the timing inevitably affects the credit available for reduction in sentence.

At this juncture, I owe thanks to Ms K. Stanhope, appearing on behalf of the Crown, for her detailed submissions and cooperation throughout these proceedings. I similarly acknowledge Mr D. Price, representing the defence by Legal Aid order, whose professionalism and assiduity have been unflagging, notwithstanding the travails imposed upon the process by multiple external factors.

It is incumbent upon this court to frame its sentencing remarks not merely as a response to the particular facts of your case, but within the broader context of shoplifting and its implications for individuals, businesses, and public order.

The wider social context cannot be disregarded. The court hears frequent representations that retail theft should be treated as a trivial matter, often viewed through a lens of economic hardship and criminal justice overreach. Yet, even the most cursory examination reveals a mosaic of harms — tangible and intangible — extending far beyond the immediate loss of goods.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

In considering these dimensions, the court is mindful of the considerable strain placed upon retail staff, many of whom are low-wage employees operating under intense customer-facing pressure, compounded by the psychological toll exacted when victimised frequently. Victim personal statements submitted herein attest to increased anxiety, adjustments to shift patterns, and a pervasive sense of vulnerability. Emotional impact must be given weight, even where physical harm is absent.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

As one reflects on the evolution of the legislated offence, it is pertinent to recall that the Theft Act 1968 was conceived during a period when shoplifting was less prevalent and retail environments markedly different. Subsequent amendments and sentencing guidelines have sought to adapt to the changing landscape of acquisitive crime, acknowledging the cumulative effect of repeated thefts and the sophistication of offending techniques.

The Sentencing Council guideline on Theft and Handling of Stolen Goods, first issued in revised form in 2022, stresses the necessity of proportionate but firm sentences in cases involving persistence, planning, and impact on vulnerable victims. 

Parallel case law informs the approach detailed herein. In R v. Fenwick [2020] EWCA Crim 1456, the Court considered “the cumulative psychological impact on small traders targeted over time” and affirmed that the degree and frequency of offending are inescapable considerations even in the absence of direct confrontation or violence. Mr Fenwick’s conduct, involving repeated theft of consumables and toiletries from multiple retail units, warranted a custodial sentence, notwithstanding his lack of prior convictions.

Furthermore, in R v. Tayeb [2023] EWCA Crim 312, the Court reiterated that the presence of aggravating factors such as use of distraction methods and failure to desist following warnings aggravate culpability. Similar principles apply here.

The influences of these judicial precedents should neither be overstated nor mechanistically applied, but rather serve as guideposts consistent with the overarching need for proportionality, public confidence, and rehabilitative potential.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

In the criminal justice system, we also observe a regrettable but persistent legacy of delays in securing timely assessment and intervention. The chronic underfunding of mental health services and routine obstacles within the Legal Aid framework have featured prominently in this case. 

While Mr Price’s diligent endeavours to obtain expert psychiatric evaluation were commendable, the protracted administrative hurdles encountered exemplify a broader systemic challenge. This court is compelled to note the growing body of critique directed towards the Legal Aid Agency’s approval processes for expert reports, often described as labyrinthine, slow, and bureaucratically inaccessible — even for cases with clear potential benefit from early clinical assessment.

The mitigation report supplied by Dr. Whitfield provides a detailed clinical formulation. She notes, among other observations, {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

Her conclusion, while refraining from a diagnosis of major psychiatric disorder, highlights personality features consistent with impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and situational stress related to housing instability. Nonetheless, Dr. Whitfield stresses the absence of an acute mental illness of such severity as to mandate hospitalisation or preclude criminal responsibility. This nuanced position offers some insight, though it necessarily leaves the court to weigh the mitigating utility of these findings against the public interest in deterrence and protection.

The remarkable and tireless efforts of local voluntary sector organisations assisting victims and defendants alike deserve recognition. The correspondence received from the Huntingdonshire Business Support Trust attests to the preventative work conducted, often under tight fiscal constraints. Their staff, who frequently engage with victims of retail crime, espouse a pragmatic approach that neither dismisses the offence as trivial nor rushes to punitive excess. Such balanced engagement is essential in both supporting recovery and reducing recidivism.

Alongside this, the Probation Service faces continued resource challenges. Probation Officer Felicity Sharp’s pre-sentence report, delivered on 15 October 2025, candidly addresses these systemic pressures, noting staff shortages have resulted in increased caseloads and delays in intervention delivery, particularly within the realm of acquisitive offending. Despite this, Officer Sharp’s report underlines a sincere willingness within the service to craft individually tailored supervision and rehabilitation plans aimed at addressing criminogenic needs comprehensively.

It would be remiss not to comment on the pervasive social malaise underpinning conditions such as those evident in your case. The courts are increasingly cognisant that insecure housing, economic precarity, and early adverse experiences contribute to vulnerability. However, such contexts can neither excuse nor absolve repeated infringement of the law. The delicate balance between understanding and accountability remains at the heart of sentencing deliberations.

The facts, as established, are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

I take note that you have no convictions for violent offences, nor have you been associated with organised crime or coercive groups, factors which, while not definitive, assist in contextualising your culpability.

Conversely, in R v. Farrar [2019] EWCA Crim 903, the Court underscored the necessity for firm sentences where shoplifting crosses the threshold into a persistent pattern of behaviour that disrupts community confidence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

It is instructive briefly to consider comparative offences cited in other case law and proceedings. For instance, the proceedings in R v. Galloway [2024] EWCA Crim 419 involved aggravated burglary of a private dwelling during a family holiday, resulting in a prolonged custodial sentence, reflecting the gravity of violation of the home environment. Though unrelated in nature, such offences underscore the gradient of community harm perceived by the judiciary. Similarly, in R v. Davies [2023] EWCA Crim 776, an unlawful deposit of waste in green belt land attracted a substantial penalty due to the environmental damage caused, demonstrating that even non-violent regulatory offences can merit custodial sentences when persistent and blatant.

Other considerations include R v. Bennett [2022] EWCA Crim 1114, where possession of a bladed article in a school car park was met with a custodial determination due to the presence of risk to vulnerable young persons. None of these cases bear directly on your culpability here but serve to illustrate the broader public safety imperatives that flow through sentencing jurisprudence.

Additionally, this court acknowledges a co-defendant in a wholly separate proceeding, whose charges for affray involving pool cues following a pub confrontation remain outstanding, their absence from this hearing notwithstanding.

Nor does this court attribute to you any wrongdoing in respect of a co-tenant’s prior conviction for benefit fraud, which while unfortunate for your immediate environment, is beyond your personal conduct.

In regard to your personal history, you are a 34-year-old individual, with previous convictions limited to theft and anti-social behaviour offences. There is no indication of gang affiliation or extremist ideology. You have disclosed a background of unstable housing and prior transient employment in warehouse and retail roles.

Regarding mitigating factors, I note the letters submitted from community support agencies, alongside a letter from your sister, Ms Dana H., which describes familial efforts to support you amidst challenging circumstances. You have also furnished a handwritten letter to the court, which, while emotionally earnest and legible, does not dismiss your responsibility.

It must be reiterated, however, that the failure to engage proactively with available support services has been noted as a factor reducing mitigation in this matter.

Turning to sentencing principles, the court is bound to apply the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, alongside the guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council. The primary considerations remain the seriousness of the offence, the degree of culpability, the impact on victims, the need for deterrence, the protection of the public, and the promotion of rehabilitation.

Community sentences incorporating rehabilitation activity requirements, unpaid work, and cognitive skills programmes must be considered in preference to immediate custody where no significant risk of serious harm exists. However, the persistent and deliberate nature of the offending, coupled with your non-engagement previously, weighs heavily.

Your guilty plea reduces the sentence discount applicable. Given the timing of your plea, credit will be awarded at no more than 20% in line with the principles articulated in R v. O’Connor [2021] EWCA Crim 1505.

I pause to note with some regret that the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted handling of defence requests for instruction of expert psychiatric input has caused substantial delay and additional procedural burden, a fact lamented by all involved and symptomatic of an ever-strained system.

The court, too, acknowledges the work of the clerk staff, ushering team, and courtroom security personnel who have maintained order and facilitated today’s proceedings, especially in the recently refurbished Court 5 at the Huntingdon Crown Court complex.

I will now adjourn further sentencing until receipt of a detailed pre-sentence report, which will assist in a holistic assessment of your personal circumstances, previous history, offending pattern, and viable rehabilitative options. The report should also consider any risk posed to the public and the appropriateness of available intervention programmes within the local Probation Service.

In conclusion, I intend to reserve sentence pending receipt of that report. This will allow for proper consideration of all relevant factors and will enable me to impose a sentence which balances justice, reparation, and reform.

These sentencing remarks have been delivered on 16 October 2025 in Court 5 of Huntingdon Crown Court. A formal transcript has been recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal sentence within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 currently apply. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
