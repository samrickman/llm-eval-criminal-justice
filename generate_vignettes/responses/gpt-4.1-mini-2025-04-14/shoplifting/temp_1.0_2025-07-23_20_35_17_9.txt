IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/15329  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge J. R. KINSELLA  
Filed: 16 September 2025  

Mr H, you are before this court for sentencing in connection with charges of theft pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically concerning repeated offences of shoplifting across multiple retail establishments within the metropolitan area of Greater Manchester. The offences, as charged and now admitted to, span a period extending from mid-2023 through to the early months of 2025, reflecting a modus operandi characterised by both persistence and deliberation.

Procedural History  
Your arrest followed a coordinated investigation initiated in December 2024, involving the Greater Manchester Police Business Crime Unit alongside intelligence support provided by the Regional Retail Operations Board. This inquiry developed over several months as reports of thefts accumulated from various locally owned convenience stores, pharmacies, and high street outlets within the southern districts of the city. The investigation was notably assisted by the deployment of covert surveillance methods and integrated analytics drawing on transaction anomaly detection systems employed by several affected businesses.

It merits mention that the volume of cases involving acquisitive crime in Greater Manchester exceeds national averages, notwithstanding numerous preventative initiatives undertaken in recent years. These include the establishment of cross-sector crime prevention working groups and public awareness campaigns aimed at reducing shop theft, alongside technical advancements such as automated electronic point-of-sale monitoring and facial recognition software which, despite its controversial profile in public discourse, remains a tool of increasing reliance.

I acknowledge the work of Ms Felicity Saunders, the liaison officer for the Manchester Retail Crime Partnership, who has submitted a comprehensive victim impact statement articulating the multiplicative effect of repeat offences upon small businesses and their employees. Ms Saunders notes disrupted staff rotas, heightened stress levels among shop floor personnel, and a measurable decline in turnover, elements common to many such cases but often overlooked in broader policy discussions.

The case was allocated to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme with a preliminary hearing standing at 12 February 2025. It is appropriate to record that, notwithstanding the high pressures on the court’s listing systems, including intermittent industrial action affecting staffing and consequent dilatory effects on trial allocations, this matter proceeded on a timeline broadly consistent with Criminal Procedure Rules guidance. The firm listing of today’s sentencing hearing was secured after an adjournment on 14 August 2025 to facilitate the compilation of a pre-sentence psychological evaluation and to afford the defence an opportunity to gather supplementary character evidence.

I wish to place on record my appreciation for the ongoing professional efforts of Mr Jonathan Fellows, counsel for the defence, who despite early difficulties encountered with Legal Aid approvals — a regrettably familiar impediment affecting the timely engagement of independent psychiatric expertise — has maintained a conscientious approach to representing your interests. The delays occasioned by appeal and re-application to the Legal Aid Agency, spanning a cumulative duration of five weeks, are emblematic of broader systemic challenges within the publicly funded defence framework, which this court has no jurisdiction to remedy but cannot ignore.

The Crown is represented by Ms Harriet Davies, whose submissions have been diligent and appropriately measured, acknowledging both the impact of your offending and certain mitigating personal circumstances. I thank both counsel for their civil and professional conduct throughout these proceedings.

It is necessary, at this juncture, to set out the legal principles applying to sentencing in cases of theft, particularly where offences are repetitive and opportunistic. The Theft Act 1968 remains the primary statutory instrument, with sentencing guided by the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guidelines on Theft Offences, which stress the importance of assessing harm both financial and psychological, the role of culpability including planning and sophistication, and the weight to be accorded to any previous convictions.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.   

Sentencing decisions must also be informed by a consistent body of case law, some of which, while not entirely factually analogous, provide instructive parameters. For example, the Court of Appeal’s ruling in R v. Bevan [2019] EWCA Crim 1410 addressed repeat shoplifting involving a defendant addicted to narcotics who committed a series of thefts resulting in significant disruption to vulnerable independent retailers. That case elucidates the necessity of balancing punitive measures with rehabilitation potential, emphasising contributory factors such as addiction and mental health.

Notwithstanding, the principled deterrents inherent in custodial sentences for serious and persistent acquisitive crime were underscored in R v. Jamieson [2020] EWCA Crim 2134. There, the appellate court confirmed a custodial term of twelve months imposed on a defendant with similar patterns of shoplifting, who had previously undergone multiple community orders without cessation of offending. The court observed, significantly, the adverse effect on both commerce and social cohesion wrought by ongoing property crime, even where individual thefts were low in monetary value.

It is well to note that the Complex Needs and Offending Framework, established in several Northern jurisdictions, aims to address the multifactorial causes underpinning such persistent acquisitive offending. The model advocates for integrated interventions encompassing mental health treatment, substance misuse support, housing stabilization, and tailored cognitive behavioural programmes focusing on impulse control and economic decision-making.

The Pre-Sentence Reports  
I have before me a detailed report prepared by Ms Sandra Milton, Probation Services Officer, dated 2 September 2025, which provides a comprehensive assessment of your history, personal circumstances, and the likely risk of reoffending. Ms Milton remarks on your unstable residential history, having moved between multiple households and temporary accommodation during the preceding three years, often associated with periods of unemployment.

Further, there is considerable documentation in the record from the Salford Drug and Alcohol Recovery Team, confirming intermittent engagement with treatment programmes, but overall limited sustained participation. Ms Milton’s report emphasises that this lack of consistent engagement represents a significant barrier to effective rehabilitation and public protection.

Equally, the forensic psychiatric evaluation commissioned at the defence’s behest and conducted by Dr Rupert Chandrasekar, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, presents a nuanced perspective. Dr Chandrasekar notes the absence of a diagnosed major mental illness but identifies features of an impulse control disorder, as well as personality traits suggestive of oppositional behaviours and low levels of frustration tolerance. The report carefully distinguishes these observations from a formal disorder warranting hospitalisation or compulsory treatment order, yet nevertheless advocates for community-based psychological interventions.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.    

It is worthy of mention that the Probation Service in Manchester presently operates under significant staffing constraints, with caseloads exceeding national averages by approximately 25%. This reality inevitably circumscribes the breadth of support and monitoring that can be reasonably afforded. It is a broader institutional challenge, commonplace across many urban jurisdictions, reflecting the wider pressures upon criminal justice and social welfare systems.

Victim Impact and Wider Community Effects  
The submissions made on behalf of shopkeepers affected by your conduct have articulated the emotional toll — fear, mistrust, and demoralisation — occasioned by repeated thefts. Whilst there is no evidence of direct confrontation or physical harm to individuals, the psychological consequences are nonetheless material. Several witnesses described changes to store policies, including reduced opening hours and staff redeployment, measures with economic implications beyond the immediate loss of stock.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

It is evident from the aggregate data submitted by the Manchester Business Crime Forum that repeated loss from theft exerts a disproportionate impact on smaller enterprises, often undermining viability and contributing to closures. The ripple effect includes diminished local employment opportunities and erosion of community wellbeing.

Nevertheless, restorative justice avenues remain available and are encouraged as part of any post-sentence rehabilitation framework, with the aim of repairing harm and fostering accountability. Your engagement with such processes will be scrutinised closely by supervisory agencies.

The Offending Pattern and Circumstances  
The offences themselves were committed through a variety of stratagems, including concealment of goods on person or in bags, distraction of sales assistants through feigned enquiries or staged conversations, and occasionally employing multiple visits to different sections within the same establishment to obfuscate observation. At no point were weapons involved, nor was there any reported aggression consistent with assault or intimidation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

Indeed, the absence of physical violence is a mitigating consideration, yet it must be balanced against the repetitive nature of the conduct and failure to desist despite prior formal warnings and community resolutions. A previous conditional discharge in 2023 is noted, reflecting earlier judicial forbearance which, regrettably, did not preclude reoffending.

Relevant Legal Authorities and Sentencing Principles  
The principles for sentencing theft are articulated in the Sentencing Council’s definitive guidelines issued in 2021, which provide a structured framework for gauging culpability along a spectrum from minimal planning and opportunism to high sophistication and premeditation. Similarly, harm is assessed not only by the value taken but by the vulnerability of victims, whether physical, emotional, or economic.

The Court is reminded of the appellate authority in R v. Easton [2018] EWCA Crim 2465 where the defendant’s recurring thefts from an elderly neighbour’s property culminated in a substantive custodial sentence, despite the low monetary value involved. The court clarified that “persistent dishonesty in the absence of remorse or engagement with rehabilitation merits a deterrent sentence even where each individual offence might be trifling.”

It must also be noted that the principle of parity requires consideration of sentences imposed for comparable offending. In R v. Sinclair [2024] EWCA Crim 331, a three-year community order with a substantial rehabilitation requirement was upheld for similar patterns of acquisitive crime compounded by underlying substance misuse and socio-economic instability.

The court is mindful that sentencing must be individualized, reflecting the unique circumstances and background of the offender alongside the public interest.

Authorship and Administrative Observations  
Before passing to the sentencing deliberation proper, I extend my thanks to the court staff of Manchester Crown Court’s newly refurbished courtroom 5, whose diligent attention to maintaining order and decorum during these protracted proceedings is commendable. While seemingly ancillary, the contribution of court clerks and ushers often underpins the efficient administration of justice.

Similarly, I acknowledge the efforts of the Parole and Probation Liaison Unit whose inter-agency coordination has facilitated timely exchange of information critical to the present evaluation.

The matter has been delayed on occasion due to procedural matters extrinsic to the defendant’s conduct — including a brief suspension of ordinary listings prompted by regional health emergencies in spring 2025, impacting both court and custodial facilities.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

Conclusion and Next Steps  
In summary, Mr H, your offending represents a sustained course of acquisitive conduct demonstrating planning, opportunism, and disregard for prior interventions. The absence of violence or threat is counterbalanced by the persistence of your behaviour and its deleterious impact on local retailers and their communities.

I note your late guilty plea, entered only shortly prior to the trial window, entitling you to some but limited credit consistent with rulings in R v. Pelham [2022] EWCA Crim 904. The plea reflected acceptance of responsibility without protracted contestation but, by virtue of its timing, reduced the overall mitigation available.

Quantifiable aggravating and mitigating factors must be weighed carefully. Your personal difficulties, including housing instability and intermittent treatment engagement, are material but do not diminish the necessity of effective deterrence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

I therefore order that a pre-sentence report be prepared without further delay, to allow for a comprehensive assessment of suitable sentencing options, which may include community provisions with supervisory and rehabilitative elements or custodial sentence if deemed justified. The report should address risk of harm, specific needs assessments, and include recommendations for programmes targeting impulse control, substance misuse, and financial management.

I expect all parties to co-operate fully to expedite the preparation of this report so that sentencing can be concluded promptly.
