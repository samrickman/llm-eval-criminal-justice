IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/14579  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge S. R. LINTON  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today to be sentenced following your conviction arising from a course of conduct involving theft from retail premises, offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct for which you have been convicted spanned several months and encompassed multiple shoplifting incidents across the Bristol metropolitan area, encompassing both high street stores and smaller independent outlets.

Procedural Background  
Your first police contact in this matter began on 15 February 2025 after reports were collated by several retail security teams and a coordinated response involving the Bristol Retail Crime Reduction Scheme was initiated. The initial police notice was prompted by multiple reports from separate businesses indicating repeat thefts of small but commercially significant items, such as personal care products and over-the-counter medications. These reports were collated and compared to establish consistency in modus operandi, timing, and physical description, which ultimately led to your identification.

It must be noted that such cases, though often dismissed colloquially as “minor,” impose a significant administrative and financial burden upon local policing and retailers alike. The court, with informed perspective, acknowledges the painstaking efforts required to collate and cross-reference security footage, inventory discrepancies, and witness statements, often drawn from personnel simultaneously managing customer demands and understaffed shifts. The reality is that the combination of technology and human oversight falls short of the ideal, with cameras often misaligned or obstructed and timestamps subject to drift, necessitating laborious manual checks to create a prosecutable narrative.

Following your arrest on 10 March 2025, conducted by officers of the Avon and Somerset Police under the authorization of a Magistrates’ Court warrant, you were interviewed. During your police interview, you exercised your right to silence but subsequently, after consideration of forensic evidence linking you to the items on security footage, you entered a guilty plea at the Crown Court arraignment held on 17 August 2025.

The case management and progression adhered, with some delay attributable to an application for legal representation funding and the scheduling constraints endemic to the Bristol Crown Court list, which, like many regional centres, experiences significant pressures due to ongoing industrial disputes and resource shortages. Of note, the Legal Aid Agency was slow to process your application for expert psychiatric assessment funding, with initial correspondence delayed by over five weeks, resulting in an adjournment of the sentencing hearing.

The Bristol Crown Court operates within the framework of Better Case Management, which is designed to streamline case progression, reduce unnecessary delay, and encourage early resolution. While this matter was not expeditiously brought to hearing, due principally to factors outside the parties' control, the court is satisfied that overall case handling was reasonable given the competing demands on judicial and prosecutorial resources.

It is a regrettable but unavoidable feature of modern criminal justice that cases involving acquisitive crime consistently compete for scarce courtroom time against matters involving, for example, serious violence, sexual offences, or large-scale fraud. The persistence of a growing volume of such offending, often by the same individuals, carries a substantial impact on public resources, personnel allocation, and, importantly, victim confidence. Recognition of that reality informs the court’s approach to sentencing in this, and similar, cases.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

By way of background, theft offences under statute and principle extend to the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner thereof. The Theft Act 1968 Section 1 establishes the basic offence, but the reality of sentencing in shoplifting cases is markedly shaped by recent guidance from the Sentencing Council and relevant case law.

The Sentencing Council guideline, last updated in 2022, emphasises the importance of considering harm — both economic and psychological — the nature and quantity of goods stolen, any breach of trust or position, and the presence of aggravating factors such as repeat offending, targeting particularly vulnerable victims, or use of threats or deception.

The importance of remorse and early pleas cannot be overstated. Cases such as R v. Matthews [2023] EWCA Crim 1321 affirm that early admissions of guilt materially reduce the burden on witnesses and the court, affecting sentencing discount rates accordingly. Conversely, late pleas, especially when entered at the commencement of trial, attract scant reduction.

In the present matter, your guilty plea was entered at the first Crown Court hearing; thus, credit will be due, subject to consideration of your conduct and history.

It is instructive to recall the judgment in R v. Ellis [2019] EWCA Crim 845, where repeated shoplifting over an eight-month span from multiple outlets attracted a custodial sentence, reflecting an aggravating pattern of behaviour. Although Mr Ellis had no previous convictions for theft, the Court of Appeal endorsed the trial court’s emphasis on deterrence given the sustained nature of offending. The present case, while not identical, shares features that caution against undue leniency.

Moreover, in R v. Rogan [2021] EWCA Crim 1920, a custodial sentence was deemed appropriate where the defendant’s repeat offences included theft of medication from a pharmacy, raising concerns about public health and vulnerability. That is relevant here given your targeting of items of similar nature, including over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, suggesting an understanding of consumer patterns and resale value.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

In considering your personal circumstances, the court has received and reviewed the pre-sentence report provided by the Probation Service, as well as the psychiatric evaluation prepared by Dr Helen Faraday, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist. Both assessments are of considerable importance in guiding the court’s sentencing approach, especially concerning your risk profile and potential for rehabilitation.

The probation report describes you as a 34-year-old male with a history of intermittent council tenancy, periods of homelessness, and sporadic engagement with mental health services. Your employment history is sparse, with multiple short-term engagements in the retail and hospitality sectors, none of which appear to have provided stable income or routine.

Dr Faraday’s report is detailed, having involved clinical interview, review of historical medical records, and application of standardised psychological measures. Her conclusions find no severe mental illness but highlight significant difficulties with impulse control, low self-esteem, and signs consistent with mild depressive disorder. There is also mention of substance misuse concerns, specifically episodic alcohol use, possibly contributing to poor judgment.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

Dr Faraday notes cautiously that while there is no evidence of a compulsive stealing disorder — such as kleptomania — your offending behaviour appears impulsive and linked with situational stressors. That diagnosis, or rather lack thereof, diminishes the prospect of wholly medicalised mitigation but opens avenues for targeted cognitive-behavioural interventions.

Intriguingly, the report also touches on your history of childhood adversity, including prolonged periods of familial instability. It is accepted that such factors may have enduring psychological effects, albeit these are by no means determinative of present conduct. Recent studies, including those cited in R v. Simons [2024] EWCA Crim 329, support the view that context matters in sentencing but cannot excuse repeated breaches of the law.

The Nottinghamshire Probation Service has, within its constraints, attempted to engage you with both accommodation support and financial advice. However, the report notes several unsuccessful appointments and a general reluctance to participate in structured interventions, raising concerns about your motivation.

The court, in accordance with established jurisprudence, acknowledges the systemic pressures on such services. Reduced budgets, staff shortages, and increasing caseloads limit available support, and yet even where such help exists, uptake remains critical to successful rehabilitation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

It should be stressed that in the wider public interest, sentencing must balance the objectives of punishment, deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation. Leveraging community-based programs aimed at breaking cycles of acquisitive offending remains preferable where circumstances allow.

The court is compelled also to acknowledge the economic and social pressures facing many in urban environments like Bristol. We are, regrettably, contending with a demonstrable rise in street homelessness and casual begging, both symptoms and exacerbators of the social fragility that breeds low-level crime. Unsheltered individuals are frequently subject to exploitation, health risks, and destitution, with mental health services struggling to meet demand amid rising referrals and overstretched resources.

This context should not diminish personal responsibility but provides explanatory framework that the court does not disregard.

I feel moved to place on record some reservations regarding the effectiveness of the Legal Aid Agency’s procedural handling. Delays in funding approvals for interdisciplinary assessments and specialist advice have been a recurring and regrettable feature in cases like yours. In this instance, the near two-month wait for approval of independent psychiatric evaluation disrupted timely case progression. These administrative impediments impede not only judicial efficiency but also erode defendants' rights to prepared representation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Further, I acknowledge the diligent contributions of the Avon and Somerset Business Crime Reduction Partnership. Their collaborative approach facilitated early information sharing, victim liaison, and evidence gathering that was instrumental in securing conviction. Without such partnerships, cases of low-level acquisitive crime are more difficult to dismantle, given evidential fragility and operational constraints.

Victim personal impact statements were received from several store managers and frontline staff. These contained candid reflections on the strain caused by repeated thefts: the erosion of trust in local communities, the scaling back of opening hours reducing access for vulnerable customers, and the demoralisation wrought by persistent apprehension of theft. While no physical harm resulted, the psychological effect upon those working in retail and community settings cannot be overstated.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

It is pertinent also to remark on the broader judicial landscape in which your case is set. For instance, R v. Harris [2017] EWCA Crim 3012 addressed an instance of persistent shoplifting accompanied by minor assault on staff, ultimately resulting in an immediate custodial sentence owing to the aggravation of threat and violence. Though your offending lacks such violence, the court reminds that there is an increasing intolerance of repeat acquisitive offending not least due to its destabilising effect on local commerce and public perception.

Comparable is the decision of R v. Moran [2016] EWCA Crim 2297, which upheld a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment where the defendant’s multiple thefts contributed to a loss exceeding £1,500 cumulatively, despite each individual theft being of low value. The collective impact of your conduct approaches similar proportions.

It is germane therefore for this court to consider the cumulative nature of these thefts. While the individual value may have been modest, the aggregate disruption and cost are appreciable—both financially and socially.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

I turn now to consider sentencing options within the scope of the Sentencing Council’s guidelines. Custodial sentencing is reserved for serious cases where offence or offender characteristics justify such deprivation of liberty. In shoplifting matters, a custodial sentence typically follows where offending is persistent, planned, or escalates and where community-based orders have proven ineffective or are inappropriate.

There is evidence that you have failed to desist despite earlier interventions, including a conditional caution issued in 2024 and a community resolution the previous year, suggesting limited engagement with rehabilitative attempts.

At present, probation resources remain under acute strain, with staff shortages and increasing caseloads tempering the availability and intensity of supervision. Nevertheless, some programmes remain operational, such as those targeting acquisitive offending, covering cognitive behavioural techniques, financial skills, and behavioural modification, which may yet serve to reduce your risk of reoffending.

Your engagement with such programmes is a matter the court expects the probation service to explore fully in their forthcoming pre-sentence report.

In crafting this sentence, I must reflect on the fact that while custodial sentences carry manifest restrictions on individual liberty, they also represent a means of public protection and deterrence. Shoplifting impacts extend beyond the immediate loss to businesses; they generate a climate of insecurity, reduce community cohesion, and strain public services.

Simultaneously, the court notes that where community remedies and treatment are appropriate and likely to be effective, these are preferred in alignment with the principle of proportionality.

The background of numerous defendants within the Bristol Crown Court echo this tragedy of repeated minor offending escalating where social supports fail or are rejected, further evidencing the complex social matrix into which this matter is situated.

I express gratitude to counsel on both sides. Ms Leah Greenwood, appearing for the Crown, presented her case with clarity and propriety. Mr Damien Callow, your learned defence solicitor, made conscientious submissions drawing attention to your personal circumstances and advocating for a tempered approach. I acknowledge their professionalism throughout these proceedings.

The physical layout and acoustics of this courtroom, recently modified with the installation of advanced sound absorption panels and refurbished witness seating, set an improved environment for clarity and solemnity in judicial proceedings. The court staff and ushers are to be commended for their diligence in maintaining order and decorum, particularly given the expanded daily list and limited break times mandated by resource constraints.

Much has been said in recent years about transparency and public accessibility to justice. Yet it is notable that today's hearing, though open to the public and media, attracted no observers outside those necessary to proceedings. This invisibility reflects a broader societal ambivalence toward acquisitive crime and an unfortunate fading of collective engagement with seemingly “ordinary” instances of criminality.

While this court respects the principle that justice should neither be theatre nor spectacle, the dearth of attention to offences such as yours poses questions about the societal value placed on safeguarding community spaces, business viability, and the dignity of frontline staff.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1} to {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8} embedded above form the core evidential basis for the convictions in this matter. It is neither necessary nor appropriate to rehearse those facts in exhaustive detail at this stage, but their presence and weight are clear.

For completeness, I acknowledge the case law reported at length in R v. Bingham [2010] EWCA Crim 1234 concerning the reduction of discount for late guilty pleas, as well as the principles outlined in the Sentencing Council’s Theft guideline, cited above.

Reference may also be made to historic cases such as R v. Wolfson [1998] 2 Cr App R (S) 36, which, although concerning charge manipulation disproportionate through duplicity, bears some procedural analogy in the management of multiple offences in a representative indictment.

There were delays, as previously noted, occasioned by the defence’s application to obtain expert psychiatric evidence and the corresponding Legal Aid funding issues. Although regrettable, these were ultimately overcome. It serves as a reminder that the whole justice system feels the weight of resource scarcity, affecting all parties including defendants.

I will now adjourn this matter to allow my clerk to prepare a formal order for the preparation of a pre-sentence report from the National Probation Service. This report should consider: your previous convictions and compliance history, the psychiatric input as summarised, any identified risk factors for reoffending, proposed community-based intervention suitability, and accommodation stability.

Following receipt of that report, the matter shall return for the imposition of sentence, which will reflect the comprehensive assessment of both risk and mitigating factors.

This concludes the sentencing remarks in the present case.

These sentencing remarks are made 14 October 2025 in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Bristol. Full transcript has been prepared and recorded pursuant to Rule 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Mr H is hereby advised of his right to appeal the sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are applicable. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
