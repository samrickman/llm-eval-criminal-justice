IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/13429  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. L. Fenwick  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing upon a substantive charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending forms part of a continuing pattern of acquisitive behaviour extending over an approximate eighteen-month period, primarily conducted within retail establishments across the Brighton and Hove area. It is necessary at the outset to situate the matter in both its procedural and wider socio-legal context, reflections upon which may assist in framing the gravity of the conduct before me and the consequent principles to be applied in sentencing.

Procedural History  
The initial allegations arose from a series of reports compiled by the local Safer Retail Partnership, a multi-agency group comprising police officers, local council representatives, and representatives from the Brighton Chamber of Commerce. Their remit includes the collation and analysis of retail crime trends, with a view to deploying tactical measures against persistent offenders. The case attracted attention due to a marked increase in reports of shop theft particularly targeting smaller, independent stores, many of which reported not only monetary loss but significant disruption to staffing routines and morale.  

You were apprehended on 27 May 2025 during an investigative operation led by the Brighton and Sussex Constabulary’s Retail Crime Unit. Your detention was the culmination of an intelligence-led initiative involving covert surveillance, analysis of electronic transaction anomalies, and deployment of plainclothes officers in identified “hotspot” areas. The operational complexity was necessitated by a recurring pattern of thefts executed at different outlets, with varying methods of concealment and timing to evade simple detection or apprehension.  

This case is illustrative of the growing demands placed upon policing resources in respect of acquisitive offences. The Metropolitan Police Service alone noted in a recent report that despite appearing minor in isolation, such offences cumulatively erode community trust and divert considerable operational capacity from other priorities. Evidence from the Sussex Police force’s own internal assessment corroborates this, establishing that between 2020 and 2024, retail theft cases accounted for a sustained 18% of all reported thefts within their jurisdiction, exerting disproportionate strain on investigative resources.  

The procedural journey of this matter has been characterised by adherence to the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, albeit not without delay. The initial listing was set following your first appearance at Brighton Magistrates’ Court on 5 June 2025, with the case duly transferred to this Crown Court for trial preparation and sentencing. An early plea hearing was scheduled for 10 July but was adjourned upon representations by your legal team to permit the commissioning of a psychiatric report.  

Your legal representation, Mr Andrew L. Dyson, of counsel instructed under Legal Aid, applied promptly for forensic assessment funding. Regrettably, authorisation was delayed due to waiting list constraints at the commissioning body, the National Forensic Institute of Clinical Psychology, with formal approval only granted at the beginning of September after a protracted series of administrative exchanges. Such delays, while unfortunate, have become emblematic of systemic pressures within the Legal Aid and forensic assessment ecosystem—factors this court recognises as impacting on the swiftness of proceedings and the wider administration of justice.  

It is right to commend the diligence of both prosecution counsel, Ms Clara Voss, and defence counsel, Mr Dyson, who have pursued this matter conscientiously despite these encumbrances. The courtroom staff have also been exemplary, facilitating remote witness attendance arrangements necessitated post-pandemic, which have proven essential to ensuring procedural fairness and accessibility. Just as important, I note with gratitude the co-operation of Brighton Retailers’ Association which enabled the Crown to secure numerous victim impact statements, essential for a rounded appreciation of the offence consequences.  

To the point of pleas, you entered a not guilty plea initially, delaying acceptance of responsibility until the eve of trial. The evidence presented, including extensive CCTV footage and forensic recovery of items traced to your possession, was incontrovertible. Your eventual change to a guilty plea, though welcome, arrived late. The Court of Appeal’s guidance on plea timing credit as set out in R v. Jarvis [2023] EWCA Crim 1259 is instructive. There, the court reiterated that timely guilty pleas promote not only efficient administration but also serve as a mark of genuine remorse and acceptance. Conversely, pleas entered belatedly, particularly when underscored by unyielding denial, are entitled to less credit.  

Your offending is thus to be assessed against a backdrop of prior engagement with the criminal justice system. You are aged 33 and have a record including three previous convictions for retail theft between 2018 and 2023. Despite earlier formal warnings and community resolution efforts, you resumed offending behaviour. These facts weigh heavily on any sentencing decision.  

Relevant Case Law and Sentencing Context  
This court routinely draws upon the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft, which provides a structured framework quantifying culpability against harm, with aggravating and mitigating factors modulating the ultimate sentence. While acknowledging the monetary value of stolen goods herein may be modest in isolation, the cumulative impact—both economically and psychically—on individuals and community sense of security cannot be discounted.  

The judgment in R v. Tennant [2019] EWCA Crim 1247 is apposite, reaffirming that sustained, repetitive theft from retail outlets, when coupled with evasive conduct and disregard for prior sanctions, moves beyond mere petty theft into a realm warranting greater deterrent response. There, a two-year custodial sentence was upheld as proportionate to the longstanding pattern of offending. It is a principle mirrored in the more recent case of R v. Orchard [2021] EWCA Crim 516, where psychological vulnerability was considered but ultimately insufficient to ameliorate a substantial immediate custodial sentence imposed for serial shoplifting targeting vulnerable neighbourhoods and independent businesses.  

Further, the court notes the significance of the Hoffman principle articulated in R v. Hoffman [2017] EWCA Crim 512, emphasizing that community confidence in retail safety is essential and that recurrent offending which undermines such confidence justifies robust sentencing. While the present case involves no violence or threat thereof, the indirect psychological pressure exerted on staff, many of whom operate in under-resourced environments and face considerable emotional burden, is a relevant subtext to the harm suffered.

The Facts of the Offence  
Turning now to the particulars of your offending, the evidence shows a carefully orchestrated course of conduct designed to maximise theft without detection or immediate apprehension. The selection of items was targeted, with repeated theft of over-the-counter medicines, high-demand personal care products, and small electronic accessories. Expert testimony on the resale value of these goods was adduced, pointing to a motivation rooted in diversion for profit rather than mere subsistence.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

There were clear patterns observable in the timing of offences, often coinciding with shift changes or periods of diminished staff presence, suggesting a calculated awareness of store routines. The modus operandi displayed a degree of sophistication, including the use of layered clothing and deceptive packaging, as well as feigned phone conversations to distract attention upon exit.  

The victim impact statements submitted on behalf of several independent retailers testify to the emotional and financial distress occasioned. I note particularly the statement from Miss Janice Harper, manager of a Brighton-based pharmacy, who reported repeated incursion by persons matching your description, resulting in the adoption of restrictive staff policies, including single-person shifts being cancelled and increased security expenditure.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

There is also evidence that these offences caused other indirect consequences. A local food retailer reported interruption to supply chains due to inventory discrepancies stemming from theft, forcing adjustments to ordering practices and impacting on community access to essential goods.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Moreover, the return visits to the same premises demonstrated a disregard for warnings and informal cautions issued by store management and police liaison officers. It was this flagrant recidivism and absence of contrition during the early phases of proceedings that contributed to the present prosecution.  

The Effect on Public and Institutional Services  
This court acknowledges the wider pressure that acquisitive crime places on public services. The Sussex Probation Service, in a recent operational review, reported rising case loads linked to theft-related offenders and expressed concern at attrition rates partly due to resource shortfalls. This inevitably impedes effective supervision, reduces meaningful intervention opportunities, and undermines public protection goals.  

Similarly, the Local Authority’s Housing Options Team provided correspondence indicating acute strain from increasing homelessness and precarious housing arrangements, circumstances frequently intersecting with offending patterns such as those before the court. It is lamentable, though not unexpected, that the confluence of social determinants often manifests in the criminal justice arena.  

Nonetheless, as was underscored in the judgment of R v. Caldwell [2018] EWCA Crim 289, systemic external pressure, while a relevant consideration, cannot supersede the individual accountability demanded by the law. The court must balance empathy with enforcement, rehabilitation with deterrence.  

The Psychiatric and Probation Reports  
Dr Samantha Milton, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, provided a detailed report following an assessment conducted in September. Dr Milton’s conclusions were nuanced: while dismissing any major psychiatric disorder, she identified traits consistent with intermittent impulsivity, heightened anxiety, and elements of emotional dysregulation. She noted limited engagement with offered support services and a history of inconsistent compliance with prior community orders. Although substance misuse was not diagnosed, the report references episodic alcohol use that may exacerbate underlying vulnerabilities.  

The pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Mr David Coleman set out a thorough criminal history, social circumstances, and identified risk indicators. Mr Coleman recommended consideration be given to structured community rehabilitation with potential inclusion in cognitive behavioural therapy components focusing on acquisitive offending patterns. The report also flagged precarious housing stability and lack of current employment as factors warranting tailored intervention.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Support letters were tendered from local voluntary agencies, including Brighton Outreach and Support Network (BOSN), commending your intermittent engagement with outreach workers but expressing concern regarding your failure to sustain involvement in work readiness programmes. The voluntary sector plays an invaluable role in mitigating recidivism, and their insights here are duly noted.  

The Court must, however, express disappointment at the missed opportunities for meaningful engagement, a failure which limits realistic prospects for diversion or non-custodial remedy at this juncture.

Legal Submissions and Considerations  
Counsel for the defence urged the court to apply maximum available credit for your guilty plea and personal mitigation, emphasising background factors including unstable family circumstances and economic hardship. Reference was made to the case of R v. Simmons [2022] EWCA Crim 345, wherein a community order with intensive support was fashioned for a similarly situated individual.  

The prosecution appropriately submitted that while mitigation exists, persistent reoffending amid multiple chances militates against leniency. She reminded the court of the imperative to send a deterrent message to undermine repeat low-level offending, framing the conduct within a broader suppression strategy endorsed by local policing plans.  

Among the principles engaged is the need to give due weight to the cumulative effect of repeated offending, as elucidated in R v. Teal [2020] EWCA Crim 1982. Courts must also address the reality that low-value thefts, compounded over time, generate significant societal cost and have tangible impact on victims' well-being and security.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The court has considered all submissions, including the additional letters from your family members, which speak of your character in more favourable terms but do not detract from the gravity of your conduct or its consequences.  

It is noteworthy that applications to the Legal Aid Agency for funding of expert psychological evaluation experienced unusual delay, a matter which this court regrets, given the importance of expedient and comprehensive assessment in informing sentencing disposition.

Final Observations and Next Steps  
The legal framework is clear and well-established. While courts retain discretion to divert or adopt rehabilitative strategies where appropriate, the overarching principles of public protection, just punishment, and deterrence remain primary.  

The substance of the offending before me must be addressed with an outcome proportional to the seriousness of behaviour, the impact on victims and community confidence, and your criminal history. Nevertheless, I remain mindful of your personal circumstances and the imperative for treatment-focused opportunity where consistent with public safety.  

I have directed a comprehensive pre-sentence report be compiled by the probation service, encompassing updated assessment of risk, suitability for community-based interventions including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy modules and any specialist addiction treatment if indicated. The report will also explore options for unpaid work and curfew restrictions, assessing feasibility given your current housing situation.  

This sentencing hearing has been conducted in open court, with all parties in attendance, including prosecution counsel Ms Clara Voss, defence counsel Mr Andrew L. Dyson, and representatives from victim
