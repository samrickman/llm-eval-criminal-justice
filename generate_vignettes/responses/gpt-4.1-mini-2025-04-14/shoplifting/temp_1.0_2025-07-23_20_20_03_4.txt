IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14321  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge S. A. Goldsmith  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in relation to a course of conduct amounting to theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending took place over a protracted period extending from the autumn of 2023 through April of this year, and occurred principally within the Birmingham metropolitan area, encompassing outlets in Handsworth, Harborne, and Sutton Coldfield.

Preliminary and Procedural Overview  
The circumstances giving rise to your arrest and subsequent charge are the product of a sustained and multi-agency inquiry, in which officers from the West Midlands Police Commercial Crime Unit worked closely with representatives of the Birmingham Business Crime Partnership, local authority licensing teams, and security operatives employed by affected retail chains. Initial reports of theft — frequently appearing isolated — coalesced, upon diligent collation and cross-reference of intelligence, into a discernible pattern of repeated shoplifting incidents featuring a male suspect who, it is now established, is you.  

This pattern of episodic offending, though low in individual value, demonstrated at scale a serious disruption to local commerce and the wellbeing of retail staff. The investigative process that followed was necessarily time-consuming and resource-intensive. Such efforts are often underappreciated by the public at large. The widely held assumption that retail theft cases are straightforward belies the complex reality: the hours expended by investigators compiling pages of CCTV footage with imprecise timestamps, the necessity of multiple witness interviews with part-time employees continually rotating out of roles, and the need for painstaking forensic analysis of recovered goods and clothing. The notion that modern CCTV technology offers a panacea is a misleading simplification. The reality too often involves grainy, static images, frequently recorded from oblique angles or subject to lighting conditions rendering identification challenging or impossible.  

Furthermore, this allocation of specialist resources detracts from the capacity to respond to more immediate threats to safety and order, including violent crime and organised gang activity. It is a lamentable but unavoidable consequence of the broadening remit borne by policing bodies nationwide.  

You were arrested on the morning of 5 May 2025, subsequent to coordinated surveillance operations and the seizure of personal effects whose forensic examination confirmed associations with multiple incidents under investigation. Your initial interview, conducted under caution in the presence of legal counsel on 7 May, revealed no admission of guilt. Nonetheless, the cumulative documentary and testimonial evidence was, by the time of your arraignment on 19 May, compelling enough to sustain a representative charge consolidating eight separate incidents.  

Adjournments and Legal Aid Issues  
It is regrettable that progression to sentence has been delayed on two occasions, principally owing to applications for funding to instruct an independent psychiatric expert and for the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. Correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency, with whom I shall express my customary disappointment, was protracted and marked by procedural ambiguity, with repeated requests for supplementary information hindering prompt authorisation. Such impediments strain the administration of justice and contribute materially to the congestion in court timetables.  
In respect of this, I record my thanks to Ms Eleanor Chambers, representing you under a Legal Aid representation order, for her patient and professional advocacy amid these procedural challenges. Equally, I am indebted to Ms Fiona Leung, prosecuting counsel, for her clear and measured submissions throughout these proceedings.  
It is also pertinent to place on record the efforts of the West Midlands Business Crime Partnership, whose coordination between affected retailers and local policing units facilitated the assembly of victim impact statements and the collation of evidentiary material fundamental to the Crown's case. Their ongoing liaison with businesses, often in the face of staffing limitations and budgetary pressures, bears testament to the value of public-private cooperation in addressing acquisitive criminal conduct.

The Business Crime Reduction Initiative within Birmingham has endeavoured to establish protocols for early warning and information-sharing. While the aspiration of seamless inter-agency collaboration is laudable, reality often resists such neat coordination, with inconsistent application of data controls, variations in risk assessment standards, and frequent turnover of personnel undermining continuity. That said, in the present matter, the intervention was both timely and proportionate, paving the way for instruction of targeted enforcement resources.

Social Context and Broader Observations  
One cannot adjudicate these offences without acknowledging the wider social environment in which they arise. The current period is marked by escalating housing insecurity, a palpable increase in street-level begging, and pervasive economic precarity. The Court is cognisant of research indicating a correlation between deprivation and acquisitive crime; however, it must also be emphasised that such associations do not translate into determinism. Many confront hardship without resorting to criminality. The law, therefore, enjoins the court to balance compassionate understanding with the imperative of accountability.  
Periodic pressures upon the National Health Service, notably within mental health provision, are well documented. Waiting times for adult psychological services have lengthened substantially in recent years, with access often mediated by complex referral pathways and constrained by limited remuneration frameworks. Such systemic deficits inevitably impact individuals at risk and may exacerbate patterns of offending.  
That said, the present case involves no diagnosed major mental illness, a matter to which I shall return.

Jurisprudential Landscape  
Reference must be made to the prevailing sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council for England and Wales pertaining to theft offences. The framework sets out a structured approach, with tiers calibrated by the monetary value of property taken, the offender’s culpability, and aggravating or mitigating factors.  
In particular, I have considered *R v Chesney* [2019] EWCA Crim 1507, which addressed the issue of repeated shoplifting from independent pharmacies, emphasising that the cumulative impact on both financial loss and staff morale may warrant sentences exceeding the baseline. The Court in Chesney reiterated that community-based disposals should be considered where appropriate, but public protection and deterrence must be paramount in repeat cases.  
Similarly, *R v Aldridge* [2021] EWCA Crim 845 established that late guilty pleas, entered only when the weight of evidence is overwhelming, should receive reduced credit in recognition of the additional burden placed upon prosecutorial and court resources.  
I have also had regard to the observations made in *R v Hassan* [2023] EWCA Crim 2103 concerning coercive and hostile behaviour towards retail staff during offences of theft. Although none of these aggravating behaviours is attributed to you, Hassan remains a salient indicator of the judiciary’s evolving recognition of the broader harms occasioned by such offences.

It is instructive to recall *R v Tremblay* [2017] EWCA Crim 305, wherein the defendant’s use of counterfeit identification to facilitate shoplifting was found to demonstrate a high degree of planning and sophistication. While not directly germane here, that trend towards complexity is something courts must vigilantly monitor as offenders employ increasingly varied tactics.

The Law and Procedural Notes  
The statutory framework under the Theft Act 1968 remains unchanged in its essential features since its initial enactment; however, numerous amendments and interpretative case law have refined its application, particularly relating to the calculation of value and intent. The applicability of community sentencing options has also evolved, following the introduction of Rehabilitation Activity Requirements and the expansion of unpaid work mandates, reflecting a modern emphasis on active reparation and reintegration.

Of note is the relatively recent guidance issued by the Sentencing Council concerning the assessment of ‘Harm and Culpability’ within acquisitive crime, which instructs courts to consider not only the monetary damage but also the emotional and psychological effect on victims, including the disruption to business operations and the knock-on impact upon staff mental health and community confidence.

Infrastructure Observations  
This Court is housed within the Queen Elizabeth Justice Centre, an institution opened in 2011 to consolidate and modernise Birmingham’s criminal and civil justice services. The facilities have been recently refurbished, incorporating digital evidence presentation systems and integrated case management software designed to reduce administrative overhead and facilitate faster case progression. Nevertheless, the pressure exerted by increasing caseloads and staffing shortfalls persists.

I note plaintiffs and defendants disproportionately affected by scheduling delays wrought by the recently implemented Judicial Officers’ training program, which temporarily reduced court availability. Such operational challenges, while temporary, inevitably extend the gestation period of cases—something regretted by all participants.

Victim Impact and Support Organisations  
Victim liaison officers have prepared detailed submissions delineating the impact of your offending on individual workers and retail premises. These accounts describe a palpable deterioration in workplace morale, increased fear of repeated encounters, and the subsequent imposition of costly security measures such as increased staffing, CCTV upgrades, and physical barriers. Staff turnovers and absenteeism linked to fear and stress have added indirect costs.  

Additionally, representations submitted by the West Midlands Retail Workers Forum highlight persistent anxieties caused by repeated business-targeted crime, which in turn contributes to a broader climate of insecurity in commercial districts. The voluntary sector entity ShopSafe Birmingham has also submitted observations on the need for restorative justice approaches in tandem with deterrent sentencing, emphasising the importance of integrating offender rehabilitation alongside victim support.

Expert Assessments and Psychological Evaluations  
Mr H, your case was referred to Dr Lydia Connors, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, whose report dated 27 August 2025 forms part of the court bundle. Dr Connors concluded that while you exhibit traits consistent with impulsivity and low mood, there is no recommendation for a formal diagnosis of major psychiatric disorder or personality pathology. She noted evidence of mild to moderate dependence on alcohol but no active engagement with treatment services.  

Critically, Dr Connors emphasised that your lack of engagement with available social and therapeutic support mechanisms significantly diminishes prospects for community-based interventions unless accompanied by a demonstrable commitment to change. This assessment is consistent with the probation service's observations detailed within the pre-sentence report received on 10 September 2025, which also highlighted your sporadic attendance at appointments and minimal co-operation with assigned case workers.

Your personal circumstances are also of note. You are currently 34 years of age with a history of several convictions for similar offences dating back to 2017. You are presently residing in temporary accommodation provided by the Birmingham City Council Housing Department, following an eviction earlier this year precipitated by rent arrears.  
The difficulties posed by your housing instability, while acknowledged, neither excuse nor justify your actions but do provide context, to which the probation service has attested in its assessment of risk and utility of proposed interventions.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

As to your offending behaviour itself, the prosecution has adduced numerous CCTV recordings capturing your repeated presence in stores during peak hours, often accompanied by furtive conduct such as concealment within clothing or bags.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

Using clear evidence gathered over an extended period, the investigators reconstructed your typical modus operandi: selection of targeted items, timed diversion tactics directed at staff members, and evasive routes to exit points consistent with a deliberate pattern.

The court is mindful that this is not an offence of sudden desperation but rather one exhibiting a degree of premeditation and repetition.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

During interviews, you have sought to attribute your offending to financial stress and unemployment, self-reporting episodic usage of prescribed antidepressants. However, your explanations have been inconsistent and uncorroborated by independent medical records.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

The court also notes the evidence, introduced at trial and reported here for completeness, of your engagement with informal community networks, some of which have expressed frustration at your reluctance to pursue offered support or training opportunities.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

It remains a core tenet of sentencing that personal mitigation—while relevant—must be balanced against the wider public interest and the need for deterrence. Your persistent offending in the face of prior warnings and minimal intervention precipitates concern regarding the risk of reoffending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

The evidentiary record also confirms that, notwithstanding informal cautions and a community resolution imposed in 2021, this course of conduct continued.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Finally, it bears stating that victim impact statements presented at trial from multiple retail workers describe tangible distress and loss of sense of security, which continues to affect their wellbeing and capacity to perform their duties.

Sentencing Framework and Considerations  
The established sentencing framework requires assessment of culpability, harm, and the availability of community-based options. Given your history and pattern, the court sees limited scope for a wholly suspended sentence. The factors militating in favour of custody include persistence, failure to engage with support services, and the ongoing impact on vulnerable retail staff and businesses.

The legal principles underpinning sentencing in such cases are well articulated in the guidance of the Sentencing Council and reinforced by case law, notably *R v Stapleton* [2020] EWCA Crim 950, which confirmed that persistent acquisitive crime is appropriately met with sentencing that reflects both individual culpability and community harm.

Conversely, mitigating factors such as your expressed willingness to accept responsibility at the earliest possible moment—albeit after the presentation of irrefutable evidence—and your current housing difficulties will be factored accordingly.

The court acknowledges the efforts of the Birmingham Probation Trust, which has commissioned a bespoke community rehabilitation programme aimed at addressing offending-related cognition, financial management capabilities, and alcohol misuse. The degree to which you will comply with such interventions remains uncertain but is not, at this stage, determinative.

Public Safety and Rehabilitation  
This court is ever mindful of the dual mandates of public protection and rehabilitation. The Probation Service faces profound challenges: escalating caseloads, staff attrition, and reduced funding exacerbate difficulties in delivering effective and consistent supervision. It must be hoped that these systemic issues do not foreclose opportunities for meaningful intervention in cases such as yours.

Likewise, the NHS’s stretched mental health services pose barriers to timely assessment and treatment of underlying vulnerabilities that may contribute to offending behaviour. While no formal diagnosis is recorded here, it is clear that emotional health and wellbeing remain compromised and merit further clinical attention.

Such complex social and health-related factors underscore the imperative for multi-agency collaboration, yet the reality remains that resourcing shortages and bureaucratic inertia regularly hamper holistic responses.

Closing and Directions  
Having considered all the foregoing factors, I will order a further short adjournment to enable the probation service to prepare an updated report incorporating both risk assessment and the feasibility of immediate community interventions, including unpaid work, rehabilitation activity requirements, and substance misuse support.

I remind all parties that sentence must balance personal circumstances with the wider need to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice, deter future offending, and recognise the impact upon those working within the retail sector.
