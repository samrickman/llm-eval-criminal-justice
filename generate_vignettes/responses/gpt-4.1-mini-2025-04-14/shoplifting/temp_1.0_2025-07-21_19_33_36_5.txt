IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTFORD  
R v. MR H  
Case No. HT2025/13865  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. D. KINSELLA  
Filed: 18 November 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence in relation to a representative charge of theft, namely shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct attributed to you arises from a series of incidents occurring over an extended period, spanning the calendar years 2023 through to March 2025, and involving multiple retail premises in several districts across Hartford and its environs. The matter has proceeded to the Crown Court following transfer from the magistrates’ court pursuant to the severity and repetitive nature of the offending.

Procedural Background  
You were first charged on 10 April 2025 after a lengthy investigation conducted by members of the Hartford Community Policing Unit in coordination with local business crime reduction entities, including the Hartford Retail Safety Consortium. The investigation itself entailed the collation of evidence from diverse sources: surveillance footage from different premises, witness statements from store employees, forensic analysis of recovered items, and corroborative CCTV images. The investigation was precipitated by reports from small independents and pharmacy chains noting a pattern of unexplained losses coinciding with your suspected presence on their premises. The police undertook substantial data analysis, integrating evidence from discrete episodes across time and geography within the borough.

The initial proceedings before the magistrates’ court witnessed a bail hearing on 12 April, at which conditions were imposed restricting your movement pending trial. Thereafter, the case was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 5 June but was adjourned for further forensic processes and the preparation of reports concerning your mental health and social circumstances. At the subsequent hearing, you entered a plea of not guilty. However, following disclosure of predominantly incontrovertible evidential material including multiple instances of matching forensic evidence, statements from victimised stores, and the absence of any credible alibi, you changed your plea to guilty on 7 October 2025, just days before the scheduled trial date.

It is regrettably all too common in cases of this nature for defendants to delay the admission of culpability until the moment when conviction becomes inevitable. This often places significant strain on the court calendar, unnecessarily prolongs proceedings, and compounds the distress experienced by victimised retail staff. The case law — notably R v. Crane [2023] EWCA Crim 260 and R v. Page [2021] EWCA Crim 1184 — emphasises the diminution of credit for guilty pleas tendered late in the process and underscores the importance of early acceptance of responsibility. Whilst you have now entered a plea of guilty, the timing is relevant and will influence any discount afforded.

In R v. Crane, a defendant was convicted of multiple counts of theft involving a structured plan to defraud a regional supermarket chain. Crane’s plea was entered on the first day of trial, after the Crown had disclosed extensive evidence, including insider testimonies and forensic connections to stolen goods. The Court of Appeal re-iterated that credit for late pleas must be moderated and applied with regard to the impact on all parties.

This court benefits from recent guidance within the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Definitive Guideline (effective from 1 April 2021), which sets out a structured approach to assessing culpability and harm, with aggravating and mitigating features clearly enumerated. This document remains the cornerstone of sentencing decisions in theft-related offences and guides the court’s discretionary exercise in your case.

A separate but related matter that has occupied the attention of this court relates to the funding and procurement of expert reports. Your defence counsel applied for funding to instruct Dr Simon Hartford, a clinical psychologist specialising in compulsive acquisitive behaviours and substance misuse. This application, which ought in a case such as this to have been swiftly resolved, was delayed by over five weeks due to administrative bottlenecks at the Legal Aid Agency, a matter about which this court has previously expressed concern. The protracted nature of such authorisations risks prejudice to defendants and hinders the timely administration of justice. Whilst I acknowledge the efforts of your legal team in navigating these hurdles, the delays are lamentable and highlight a persistent systemic issue.

The court also records its appreciation of the submissions provided on your behalf by Mr Alexander Pike of counsel, who has demonstrated commendable advocacy under difficult circumstances, notwithstanding restrictive preparation time. Similarly, Ms Thalia Joyce, appearing for the Crown Prosecution Service, has presented a concise and thorough exposition of the evidential basis for the charges and the impact upon victims.

It may aid understanding to observe that this court was established in 1976 as part of the broader reform of the judicial circuits, with the intention of improving access to justice across the Hartford and surrounding catchment area. The Crown Court, as a second-tier superior court of record, possesses inherent jurisdiction to award custodial sentences of varying duration and to manage complex proceedings, including those involving multiple defendants or intricate factual matrices. You should be mindful that this case falls squarely within the ambit of Crown Court sentencing powers, reflective of its seriousness.

It is a regrettable reality that offences of this category, once dismissed or considered minor nuisances, have in recent years attracted increased public and institutional attention. The phenomenon of repeated small-scale theft — often described as ‘petty crime’ — belies its profound cumulative impact upon individual victims and businesses alike. It is not uncommon for shops to face unquantifiable losses, staff stress, increased security measures, and in some cases, permanent closure. In this context, the court must balance the mitigating factors against the evident harm and the necessity of deterrence.

The notion of ‘community harm’ has gained traction in legal discourse and sentencing frameworks, reflecting the understanding that offences against commerce reverberate through the social fabric. The combination of diminished amenity, increased anxiety among staff and customers, and the diversion of police resources to low-level crimes carries a tangible adverse effect. Though your conduct netted relatively small individual amounts in monetary terms, the aggregate impact is not to be lightly dismissed.

By way of example, it is instructive to consider the case of R v. Callum Hardy [2022] EWCA Crim 1207, which concerned persistent theft from charitable outlets and highlighted the de-stabilising effect of such activity on both recipients and volunteers. The appellate court upheld a custodial sentence, noting that cumulative theft undermined community trust and exhibited a disregard for the vulnerable populations the charities sought to serve.

Other analogous cases include R v. Delaney [2020] EWCA Crim 455, involving low-value theft with an organised modus operandi, and R v. Gascoigne [2019] EWCA Crim 883, a case of aggravated shoplifting with repeated breach of bail conditions. Both cases reinforce the principle that repetitive acquisitive offending reflects heightened culpability.

Mr H, while you may claim personal hardship or social disadvantage as contextual factors, these are not determinative. Courts must consider each case on its merits, informed by empirical evidence and expert opinion alongside prevailing statutory and sentencing guidelines.

Having set this context, I shall now turn to the facts of your offending conduct.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

It is apparent from the evidence that your methods demonstrated tactical awareness; you exploited situational vulnerabilities, often acting during busy periods or when staff numbers were reduced. In at least two incidents, you were seen manipulating security devices or concealing items beneath clothing concealed by an outer garment.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Your actions were not impulsive. Rather, they displayed a pronounced pattern of repetition and planning, with an apparent understanding of store layouts and routine staff behaviour.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

Notably, one affected retailer, the Mapleton Convenience Store, noted an increased incidence of theft coinciding with your visits, prompting staff to request enhanced security patrols and to implement a ban on individuals matching your description.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

Recollections from store employees reveal palpable anxiety and a disruption to the working atmosphere, underscoring the psychological toll such offending exacts.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

Further, despite having received a community resolution for a prior theft in late 2022, you resumed similar behaviour within a matter of months, highlighting a lack of deterrence and disregard for official warnings.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

Lastly, your conduct entailed multiple breach of bail conditions wherein you were prohibited from entering certain retail premises, yet evidence confirms attendance and further offences during this restricted period.

Expert Evidence and Reports  
The psychiatric assessment undertaken by Dr Simon Hartford, to which I have earlier referred, is thorough and provides pertinent insights. Though it explicitly states you do not suffer from a diagnosable major mental illness, it identifies traits of impulsivity, potential mild dependence on illicit substances, and borderline personality features that may contribute to difficulties with self-regulation. Nonetheless, it is emphasised that these do not amount to a clinical excuse and will not absolve responsibility.

The Probation Service pre-sentence report, prepared by Officer Emily Radcliffe, is detailed and drawn from multiple sources, including interviews with yourself, family members, and previous case workers. It highlights your social circumstances: transient housing status, lack of employment, and minimal engagement with support services. Several attempts were made to introduce you to voluntary sector bodies providing budgeting advice, addiction treatment, and mental health support, yet attendance was sporadic.

Such findings are not uncommon in cases before this court and underscore the complex interplay of social, psychological, and economic factors influencing behaviour.

It is noted that you are 34 years of age with a recorded history including five convictions, all for acquisitive crime, the earliest dated to 2017. There is no evidence of gang association or coercion. The court places emphasis on the pattern of recidivism and the failure to utilise available diversionary or rehabilitative pathways.

Broader Context and Institutional Considerations  
As has been remarked upon in previous sentencing remarks, the pressures on the probation service and associated agencies tasked with supporting offenders are considerable. Caseloads have increased markedly in the past five years, while resources remain static or have been reduced. Waiting lists for mental health provision can extend into months, and access to specialised substance misuse services is similarly constrained.

Additionally, the policing of low-level acquisitive crime is increasingly fraught with competing priorities. Officers are often diverted from serious violent crime investigations to deal with persistent retail theft, resulting in effective resource strain and frustration among policing leadership.

Attempts to address these issues in a comprehensive manner, through multi-agency risk assessment conferences and business crime partnerships, have met with mixed success. Variability in engagement, fluctuating staff levels, and procedural inertia can inhibit meaningful progress.

It is in this milieu that your offending must be situated, but without diminishing your accountability. Numerous third sector organisations continue to provide invaluable assistance. For example, the Hartford Shopfront Support Network has offered multiple sessions on crime prevention and victim support with notable professionalism and compassion. Their recent report submitted to the court outlines the heightened impact of shoplifting on small retailers who lack sophisticated loss prevention mechanisms.

This court also acknowledges the pro-bono efforts made by some retailers in providing evidence and testimony, recognising the often difficult and time-consuming nature of giving witness accounts for cases involving relatively modest monetary-value offences.

Turning now to relevant case law again, R v. Thorne [2022] EWCA Crim 323 raised complex issues concerning mentally disordered offenders who commit acquisitive crimes without full appreciation of implications. The court emphasised the need for proportionality, balancing therapeutic interventions with the protection of the public.

Another recent ruling, R v. Elgin [2024] EWCA Crim 1155, considered breaches of bail conditions in the context of repeat theft, concluding that persistent disregard signals an elevated culpability pattern. Such activity undermines trust and risks erosion of normative compliance.

It must be said that while the current court calendar has been affected by industrial action amongst court clerks and some intermittent issues with interpreter availability, these procedural considerations have not demonstrably delayed your case beyond reasonable extents. The judiciary and court staff have worked assiduously to prioritise cases such as yours where there exists a need to address offending behaviour promptly.

Victim Impact and Wider Harm  
Statements from affected retail staff describe increased anxiety, stress-related sick leave, and changes to work patterns resulting from your repeated presence and conduct. One elderly assistant reported feeling “threatened” despite the absence of any overt aggression, reflecting the often unquantifiable psychological consequences of such offending.

The Hartford Business Improvement District forwarded a communication drawing attention to the cumulative economic losses reaching beyond direct theft values, encompassing augmented insurance premiums and security expenditure. These consequences can, in aggregate, threaten the viability of small enterprises and reduce local employment opportunities.
