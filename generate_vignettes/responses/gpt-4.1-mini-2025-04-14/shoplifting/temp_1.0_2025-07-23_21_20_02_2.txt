IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14839  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge I. M. Cartwright  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing on a charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, alleged to have been committed on multiple occasions during the period between November 2023 and April 2025. The indictment represents a consolidated charge encompassing a series of acts involving retail premises distributed across the central and northwest districts of Manchester. The court has presided over a number of preliminary hearings, with this occasion marking the ultimate sentencing stage. 

Procedural Background and Court Composition  
This matter was initially listed before the magistrates’ court in early May 2025 but was transferred to Crown Court jurisdiction pursuant to the sentencing powers invoked for offences charged ‘on indictment’. The case has been managed under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework introduced in 2014, designed to promote the early identification of contested issues and streamline case progression. Hearings were held on 12 June, 24 July, and 4 September, culminating in a plea and sentencing hearing today. The listings adhered largely to indicative timetables, notwithstanding some unintended delays attributable to capacity constraints within the court estate and the periodic industrial action taken by court staff in July. 

I take this opportunity to acknowledge the courteous conduct of all participants, including the prosecution team led by Ms Eleanor Fitzpatrick and the defence, Mr Oliver Price, who has appeared under a Legal Aid representation order throughout. Delays were occasioned, as is often the case, by the repeated engagement with the Legal Aid Agency concerning funding for expert reports. Mr Price’s repeated applications for ancillary funding to instruct a forensic psychologist were met with initial refusals and requests for supplementary information before final authorisation was granted in mid-August, an interval the court regrets given the importance of those reports to sentencing considerations.

The courts in this region remain acutely aware of pressures placed upon legal aid budgets and the consequent bureaucratic demands on solicitors and defendants alike. It is both irksome and regrettable that procedural obstacles of this nature so regularly imperil the principle of timeliness and impinge on the administration of justice. The court trusts that forthcoming reforms slated by the Ministry of Justice will seek to alleviate such burdens, which, in current operation, function as impediments rather than facilitators.

Wider Social and Institutional Context  
It must be observed — albeit without delving unduly into sociological discourse — that we confront a milieu in which acquisitive offences present an unrelenting challenge to both law enforcement and justice administration. Emerging data from the Greater Manchester Retail Crime Partnership reveals a persistent increase in incidents locally attributed to shoplifting, notwithstanding wider economic fluctuations. While aggravated or violent offending commands understandable public and media attention, the daily grind of petty theft exerts a less visible but no less corrosive toll on communities.

Repeatedly, the court has noted the emotional and operational strain borne by frontline retail staff tasked with loss prevention, often in premises marked by constrained resources, limited staffing, and high customer throughput. Many retailers have adopted a suite of countermeasures, including enhanced video surveillance, staff training in conflict de-escalation, and collaboration with policing teams through Business Crime Reduction Partnerships. These measures, while commendable and often effective, place additional burdens on small business owners already contending with market instability.

It is also pertinent to mention that the strains upon local probation and mental health services continue unabated. Current waiting times for adult mental health assessments frequently exceed twelve weeks, even for cases flagged as medium risk. Additionally, resource shortages within community offender management teams lead to higher caseloads for probation officers, thereby limiting the capacity for sustained, person-centred interventions. This backdrop substantially influences the preparation and availability of pre-sentence assessments, a factor upon which I shall return.

Reference to Expert and Supporting Reports  
The court has had the benefit of a clinical evaluation by Dr Jennifer Alston, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, whose detailed report dated 1 September 2025 outlines the defendant’s psychological profile. Dr Alston finds no evidence of a psychotic or major mood disorder but notes traits suggestive of impulsivity and a proclivity to seek short-term relief through risk-taking behaviours. The report also highlights an emergent dependency on low-grade substances, notably benzodiazepines, which the defendant has neither sought nor accepted formal treatment for. Dr Alston cautiously recommends structured cognitive-behavioural intervention targeting offending-related cognitions and suggests possible engagement with substance misuse services.

A pre-sentence report was prepared under the aegis of Probation Officer Ms Karen Milton, whose comprehensive documentation addresses not only risk assessment but also practical considerations relating to Mr H’s stable accommodation and social supports. Ms Milton’s report points to a history of unstable tenancy arrangements, frequent relocations owing to breach of lease agreements, and fractured family relations compounded by a lack of meaningful employment. Nevertheless, she notes the defendant’s expressed willingness to engage with rehabilitative programmes, albeit tempered by prior inconsistent cooperation. 

Mr H is 38 years of age and has four previous convictions for theft-related offences spanning a decade, none of which resulted in immediate custody. He is currently residing in temporary housing provided by the Manchester City Council Housing Support Unit, of which the staff have submitted a letter of support commending some degree of compliance with housing rules during his residency. However, they also express concern over his sporadic attendance at appointments and unexplained absences.

Inter-agency cooperation, while generally functional, has faced challenges typical of multi-agency frameworks. Information sharing between police, probation, housing, and health services has been facilitated through regular MARAC (Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference) meetings, yet systemic delays and occasional data incompatibility issues persist. Nonetheless, the court notes with approval the recent establishment of a collaborative task force specifically aimed at addressing repeat acquisitive offending within the northwest Manchester area, which appears to have brought increased focus and resources to bear.

On 8 August 2025, the court received a letter from the community charity Retailers’ Support Network (RSN), urging consideration of the cumulative psychological harm suffered by staff working under constant threat and uncertainty. Their submission underscores the limitations of legal sanctions alone in addressing the broader societal malaise and recommends increased investment in diversionary and support schemes targeting rough sleepers and those struggling with addiction. While the court welcomes such perspectives, its remit restrains it to adjudication based upon evidence and statutory framework.

On a tangential note, it bears mention that the accused’s sister, Ms Bernadine H, has been involved in ongoing family proceedings unrelated to these criminal matters, which have been the subject of court supervision in Manchester Family Court since early 2024. No witness statements or direct evidence from Ms H have been adduced in respect of this case beyond a written character reference tendered in mitigation for her brother.

Turning to the legal framework, the court is guided principally by the Theft Act 1968 and the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences, last revised in 2023. While the offences before the court involve modest monetary values, the pattern of persistent offending, targeting vulnerable retail premises including smaller independent pharmacies and convenience stores, elevates the severity. The guideline acknowledges the heightened impact of cumulative loss and emotional distress upon victims, factors accorded significant weight. The principles of sentencing admonish the necessity to achieve just punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. 

Repeated references have been made to the appellate authority in R v. Cartwright [2019] EWCA Crim 1625, where the Court of Appeal underscored that sentences for repeat shoplifting must reflect not only the value of goods taken but also the broader societal cost and damage to confidence in community safety. The Court highlighted that a failure to impose meaningful consequences risks normalising such conduct and detracting from the rule of law.

Equally germane is R v. Singh [2022] EWCA Crim 2058, wherein the defendant’s series of thefts from charity shops and small businesses led to a custodial sentence. There, the Court pointed to the need for sentences to reflect the cumulative impact on victim businesses and the staff who endure repeated, targeted victimisation. Though Mr H’s circumstances differ in particulars, the underlying principle of proportionality and public protection remains paramount.

I am compelled to record remarks on the unfortunate consequences arising in a recent unrelated case before this court involving the conviction of one Mr Graham Whittaker for aggravated affray following a pub brawl in Stockport. That case entailed the use of pool cues as weapons and led to a sentence of three years’ imprisonment, as reported in R v. Whittaker [2024] EWCA Crim 1139. While wholly unconnected to the matter at hand, such cases remind us vividly of the spectrum of criminal activity the courts must manage alongside acquisitive offences.

The Current Offence: Factual Overview  
The prosecution’s case rests on a combination of CCTV footage, witness statements from retail employees, and forensic evidence including recovered property linked to the defendant. The extent of evidence was collected over a protracted period, reflecting coordinated efforts by the Greater Manchester Police Retail Crime Unit and Business Crime Reduction Partnership.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

Surveillance recorded multiple instances of you entering and leaving premises, during which small but commercially valuable items were concealed beneath clothing. On occasion, you were seen employing distractions, including engaging store workers in benign conversation while manipulating displays. Several thefts involved removal of security tags or interference with electronic tagging mechanisms, demonstrating a degree of premeditation and familiarity with retail security measures.

While no violence or threats were directed at staff, the recurrent nature of offending led some employees to experience anxiety and hypervigilance, culminating in adjustments to work schedules and deployment of additional security staff during peak hours.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

The cumulative value of goods taken totals approximately £1,250; modest when compared to larger-scale operations but significant within the retail establishments’ tight margins, especially given repeated losses attributed to your conduct. After intervention efforts including warnings and invitation to participate in diversionary programmes proved unsuccessful, law enforcement escalated the matter.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

At arrest, you were found in possession of previously stolen items consistent with those reported missing from a local convenience store two days prior. Your clothing and personal effects were examined by forensic teams, yielding trace evidence matching incident scene samples.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

You have a prior history of shoplifting offences, including a community order imposed in 2021, which you breached on at least one occasion. Various attempts at rehabilitation through the Probation Service did not result in sustained compliance or behavioural change.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

Your defence is understandably grounded in your difficult personal circumstances, including unstable housing and employment deprivation. Your solicitor has submitted letters and statements outlining attempts to engage with community support services; however, engagement has been inconsistent.

Sentencing Considerations  
The court recognises the continuing pressures of socioeconomic deprivation, but the sheer persistence of offending, alongside previous failures to desist, cannot be overlooked. The law requires that sentences reflect not only individual culpability but the impact on victims and wider community confidence. 

Previous appellate decisions affirm that repeat acquisitive offending warrants sentences which are protective and deterrent. The possibility of community-based sanctions remains open but must be carefully balanced against public protection interests and the need for meaningful punishment.

The Psychological and Social Context  
Dr Alston’s assessment cautions that while Mr H does not suffer from a major diagnosable disorder, underlying traits of impulsivity and mild substance misuse bear on risk evaluations. Her recommendations weigh in favour of targeted rehabilitation, with emphasis on addressing cognitive distortions and factual awareness relating to offending behaviour. The probation report aligns with this analysis, urging robust engagement with treatment designed to reduce reoffending propensity.

It is worth noting that such interventions, while essential, cannot be successful absent the defendant’s genuine commitment. The court’s experience with similar clients over many years has highlighted the gulf between stated intentions and actual behavioural outcomes. That gap must be acknowledged in determining the appropriate sentencing balance.

In terms of wider protective mechanisms, this matter lies below the threshold for Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), given the nature of the offending and assessed risk. However, liaison with housing and substance misuse services remains essential, with input from community enforcement officers and addiction specialists.

The court has reviewed previous concerns expressed by store managers in unrelated cases, including those where co-defendants were charged with possession of bladed articles in school car parks and distribution of Class B drugs near protected youth centres. While such cases are tangential, they evoke the broader criminal landscape in which acquisitive offences occur, underscoring the complex interplay between social vulnerability and offending trajectories.

Victim Impact and Community Harm  
Victim impact statements submitted by managers and employees of affected retail outlets reveal substantive psychological effects, including increased anxiety, diminished workplace morale, and reorder disruption. Many staff reportedly felt compelled to modify schedules and avoid lone working. Such impacts, though intangible in economic terms, represent serious harms that sentencing must address.

The Retail Support Network’s observations further emphasise the cumulative psychological strain on small businesses dependent on tight margins and customer goodwill. Moreover, local business associations have lobbied councils to increase resources for crime prevention, with some success in enhanced policing patrols and awareness campaigns. While these measures are encouraging, systemic challenges remain.

Closing Procedural Observations  
Pre-sentence reports, expert assessments, victim statements, and submissions from both prosecution and defence have been considered with care. I note, with regret, the ongoing administrative struggles reported by liaison officers and probation staff faced with heavy caseloads and staff shortages. These conditions inevitably impact the court’s risk assessments and limit intervention capacity.

The present hearing has proceeded in open court, with all parties duly present. The judicial officers extend thanks to the court clerks and ushering staff, noting that the recently refurbished courtroom—fitted with enhanced digital audio-visual equipment—facilitated the presentation of evidence notably.

In conclusion, Mr H, the court requires further detailed information before passing sentence. I direct that the probation service prepare an updated pre-sentence report incorporating recent engagement, any further psychiatric input, and risk analysis. This is essential to enable the court to make an informed, balanced, and just determination.
