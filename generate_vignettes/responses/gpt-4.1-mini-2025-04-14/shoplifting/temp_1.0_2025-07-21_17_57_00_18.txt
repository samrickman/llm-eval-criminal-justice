IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13574  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge V. J. Pembroke  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentencing in relation to the charge of theft by shoplifting, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge concerns a sustained pattern of unlawful appropriation of goods from various retail premises across Greater Manchester, extending over a period from late 2023 to early 2025. As this court well understands, the most seemingly minor of incidents—shoplifting—when repeated, carries consequences far beyond the immediate value of goods taken. It weighs heavily on both the victims of crime and the community’s sense of security.

Procedural History  
This matter has progressed through the criminal justice system over the course of some six months. You were arrested on 11 March 2025 following a series of intelligence-led enquiries carried out jointly by Greater Manchester Police’s Retail Crime Unit and local Business Crime Reduction Partnership operatives. The investigation utilised an array of investigatory tools—from swathes of CCTV footage drawn from multiple premises to witness statements and forensic analysis of seized items.  

The procedural journey of this case has been complicated by various factors, not least of which were complexities arising from Legal Aid authorisations. Your legal team lodged an early request for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist with expertise in repetitive acquisitive offending. Regrettably, despite repeated applications, that request was mired in delays, with funding only authorised in late July 2025. Such procedural inertia within the funding agency is a serious concern, mirroring troubling delays documented elsewhere throughout the courts and legal aid literature. It impedes case preparation and inadvertently burdens judicial resources. These delays are well documented—in Pritchard v Legal Aid Agency [2023] EWHC 1143 (Admin), the court expressed judicial disquiet at systematic lag in processing such requests. I trust that lessons learned will lead to more timely authorisations in the future.

In the meantime, I wish to record the court’s gratitude to your instructing counsel, Mr Toby Simmons, who has conducted himself with consistent professionalism under challenging circumstances. Similarly, the prosecution advocate, Ms Amina Chowdhury, is thanked for her detailed and measured submissions. The listing of this matter has followed the increasingly familiar process of successive case management hearings, with this sentencing hearing fixed for today, 14 September 2025. Earlier adjournments arose from necessary procedural considerations, including the psychiatric reports and additional witness statements from community charities.

Such procedural complexities highlight the resource burdens the court system is currently under. The judiciary continues to grapple with increasing volumes of lower-tier offences being escalated to the Crown Court, particularly cases of repeated acquisitive offending, which often place strain on already overstretched police and prosecutorial services.  

In addressing the material before me, I take note of the established Better Case Management (BCM) framework, as originally introduced with the aim of improving case throughput and reducing delays. In this case, the BCM process ensured early disclosure of witness statements and relevant expert reports, although certain expected milestones—such as full disclosure of CCTV footage from all implicated shops—were received with delay. The BCM model, while laudable in principle, encounters limitations where limited staffing and procedural pressuring conspire; these realities shape the context in which factual and sentencing findings are made.

Further, the court acknowledges the role of the Retail Support Network of Greater Manchester in liaising with businesses impacted by initial incidents. Their input has proven valuable in understanding the wider ramifications beyond monetary loss, encompassing psychological distress experienced by shop floor staff and the cumulative operational disruption caused by persistent thefts. Such organisations increasingly fill a gap where formal institutional support falters, their voluntary nature underscoring both their worthiness and vulnerability. Reports from these bodies describe heightened employee anxiety, increased staff absences, and a marked reduction in service morale.

It is trite though necessary to repeat that offences of this nature do not occur in a vacuum. They unfold within a complex matrix involving social deprivation, mental health challenges, and shifting community dynamics. Yet, the law stands firm in its dual role: to uphold accountability and to recognise deserving mitigation where appropriate. I shall return to this balance in due course.

Established Case Law and Sentencing Framework  
The court must sentence having regard to the Sentencing Council’s definitive guidelines for theft offences. The principles emphasise proportionality, recognition of harm (both tangible and intangible), and the need for deterrence—both specific and general. In the present context, while the monetary value of stolen goods may often be modest, repeated offending, use of distraction techniques, and targeting vulnerable small businesses are aggravating features yielding increased culpability.

Considerable guidance arises from precedent. In R v. Thornhill [2022] EWCA Crim 1340, the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of treating repeat shoplifting offences with a deterrent approach, especially where the offender evinced little insight or engagement with rehabilitative measures. Although distinct, the factual matrix of Thornhill resonates with the circumstances in which repeat offending burdens victimised businesses and staff.

Similarly, R v. Jansen [2021] EWCA Crim 1827 cautioned that where 'late' guilty pleas are tendered, courts should carefully scrutinise whether true remorse has been demonstrated or if the plea is tactical. The more belated the admission, the smaller the credit. The court must reflect on these principles given your plea was entered only after receipt of irrefutable evidence.

Other cases of note include R v. Miller [2019] EWCA Crim 965, relevant for its elaboration on the application of sentencing discounts and the balancing of domestic hardship considerations against public interest objectives. Mr Miller’s sentence was materially affected by the court's recognition of his unstable housing situation, but critically the court did not treat this as a carte blanche exemption from lawful behaviour.

Turning from precedent, it is worth an historical note that the Theft Act 1968 itself—now approaching six decades in operation—has seen incremental modifications in sentencing scope. The principle of 'dishonesty' remains foundational, supported by the competing frameworks of common law and statute. The framework is periodically revisited by the Sentencing Council and has recently been the subject of consultation concerning further guidance for repeat acquisitive offenders.

Social and Policing Context  
In reflecting on the broader social environment in which these offences occur, it cannot be ignored that local policing resources are increasingly pressured. A recent report by the Home Office (March 2025) warns of rising demands on neighbourhood policing units due to a surge in acquisitive crime reports. Yet, despite these increased reports, officer numbers have not scaled proportionally, leading to prioritisation dilemmas.

The Greater Manchester Police Service’s Retail Crime Division has seen a marked increase in workloads related to low-level shoplifting. The deployment of digital forensic analysts—specialists in video and data analysis—has become critical but is by no means limitless. The court notes the considerable investigative effort made in this case, inclusive of digital triage of anonymised mobile device histories, which is not lightly undertaken and requires judicial sanction. Such invasive techniques require a high evidential threshold but demonstrate the
