IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHWARK  
R v. MR H  
Case No. 2025/13427  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. M. LANGLEY  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced in respect of offences of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans a protracted period from mid-2023 through to early 2025, involving multiple incidents across several locations within the boroughs of Southwark, Lambeth, and the City of London. The matter has been before this court following a series of preparatory hearings and an ultimately accepted plea of guilt to a single representative count addressing a course of offending.

Procedural History  
The prosecution’s charging process was preceded by an intricate investigation coordinated through the Southwark Business Crime Forum alongside local policing units, including the Safer Neighbourhood Teams and the Metropolitan Police Retail Crime Investigation Unit. This multi-agency collaboration sought to address increasing concern from retail stakeholders regarding a series of thefts marked by consistency of method and temporal concentration, indicative of a persistent offender targeting vulnerable and independent store environments. Initial reports were sporadic and fragmented, a circumstance not uncommon in offences of this sort, which often rely heavily on witness recollection and the piecing together of disparate digital and testimonial evidence.

The investigation featured a series of operational meetings at Timescourt Police Station spanning January to March 2025, where case officers liaised regularly with security managers, store proprietors, and corporate retail crime analysts. It was noted at these forums that whilst CCTV coverage was available at all affected premises, the quality and angle of recordings varied significantly, posing challenges for consistent offender identification. Officers were thus reliant on combining behavioural profiles, witness interviews, and itemised stock loss data to build a narrative.

It is worth noting—though peripheral to this case—that the Crimes Act 1967, historically repealed and replaced in parts by the Theft Act 1968, once contained provisions with distinct considerations for shoplifting that have since been subsumed under the broader statutory framework. Such historical context, while lacking direct application, offers an illustrative example of the evolving legal landscape recording judicial and legislative approaches to retail crime over the decades, demonstrating shifts towards more nuanced offence categorisations and sentencing calibrations.

The defendant was arrested on 22 March 2025, following surveillance and covert tracking authorised under section 28 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Prior to that, attempts to obtain authority for more invasive digital surveillance, including mobile signal interception, were considered but ultimately declined on judicial review due to proportionality concerns and the minor scale of each separate offence. The investigative team instead employed traditional evidence-gathering methods: detailed retail staff statements, extensive CCTV analysis, and a methodical tracing of stolen goods via local second-hand sales lists, some of which included distinct items identifiable as missing from the targeted stores. Forensic examination of seized clothing conducted at the Forensic Science Service laboratory in Chelmsford further implicated the defendant.

The initial charge was brought on 10 April 2025. Over the following months, the case was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing under the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, which, as frequently noted in this court, aims to expedite case progression, reduce unnecessary delay, and ensure early identification of issues for trial efficiency. The BCM exercise in this matter was, unusually, relatively untroubled by the protracted adjournments that so often characterise comparable proceedings, notwithstanding intermittent pressures on court listing availability—exacerbated by judicial strike action that paralysed several Crown Court centres during the summer of 2025.

It is appropriate at this juncture to acknowledge the diligence of both counsel. Miss Charlotte Mayhew, acting on behalf of the Crown, has, over numerous hearings, demonstrated considerable professional apiece in managing extensive evidential material and liaising with retail representatives and police. Mr Oliver Grayson, Junior Counsel appearing under Legal Aid instructions for the defendant, has also fulfilled his role conscientiously, despite recurrent and well-documented frustrations with funding delays and administrative obstructions encountered during the course of defence preparations, including protracted correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency regarding approval for expert psychiatric assessments.

The court – aware of the burgeoning caseloads facing public defenders in urban jurisdictions and the consequent risk of adviser fatigue – recognises the challenge of ensuring consistent and timely representation in matters such as this. It is an unfortunate reality that Legal Aid reforms in recent years, intended to foreground efficiency and cost containment, have in numerous cases translated into procedural hurdles that delay correspondences and constrain expert instruction. The ongoing debate about the balance between fiscal prudence and effective access to justice remains unresolved, as seen here by the multiple formal applications and extensions sought to resolve funding questions regarding psychological evaluations.

At the plea hearing conducted on 16 September 2025, having reviewed all primary materials, Mr H entered a plea of guilty. I must record, however, that this plea was entered late in proceedings and following lengthy contested exchanges concerning disclosure and evidential sufficiency. The court reminds itself – and reiterates for the parties – the principles articulated in R v Kerbey [2022] EWCA Crim 809 concerning the allocation of credit for such late guilty admissions. It is established that maximum credit is reserved for those who plead guilty at the earliest reasonable opportunity, reducing both the strain on witnesses and court resources.

In this context, the defendant’s delay is, regrettably, a disappointing but not unusual feature of acquisitive crime prosecutions. The phenomenon of ‘plea delay’ has been extensively analysed within criminal justice literature and jurisprudence, reflecting both tactical legal positioning and, in some cases, the challenges defendants face in accepting responsibility, particularly when multiple, repeated acts have accumulated over time.

To place this case within a broader judicial and criminological framework, the court refers to R v Fairclough [2019] EWCA Crim 1498, where the Court of Appeal emphasised that, although remorse and responsibility are naturally encouraged and rewarded by sentencing discounts, strategic delays are likely to be met with reduced mitigation, especially when they prolong the anxiety and inconvenience suffered by victims and other stakeholders.

The role of victim impact statements in shoplifting cases has been increasingly recognised. While initially regarded as relatively minor, it has become apparent that repeated retail thefts accumulate substantive harm, not only economically but in psychological and operational terms, as highlighted in submissions from the Southwark Retail Association. These documents depict reduced staff morale, increased turnover, and the necessity to implement costly security enhancements. A manager from the ‘Greenwood Boutique’ retail chain, for example, detailed the “chilling effect” of persistent theft on junior employees, many of whom reported heightened stress and anxiety relating to the visibility of offending minors and older offenders alike.

The court has received the probation assessment report dated 2 September 2025, prepared by Ms Suzanne Fielding, the assigned probation officer. In her analysis, Ms Fielding draws attention to Mr H’s limited engagement with community and social support interventions, noting a passive recently-completed work readiness programme that did not translate into sustained employment. The report further outlines his unstable accommodation history, including recent relocation to a temporary council flat after the termination of a private tenancy. Whilst recognising the potential criminogenic factors linked to housing precarity, the officer also stresses a notable lack of sustained application to specialised financial budgeting courses offered through local community centres—a point noted with concern given the defendant’s repeated claims that poverty drove his behaviour.

The report navigates delicately between sympathy for Mr H’s socio-economic circumstances and an unvarnished assessment of risk and responsibility. It highlights a recurring theme: the divergence between available support and defendant uptake. This quandary is not unique—experienced officers, social workers, and court professionals often confront the complex interplay of agency, choice, and capacity that underpin reoffending risks in similar cases.

The present case hence raises important questions beyond the individual scale: about the adequacy of social safety nets, the accessibility of tailored support, and the challenge of motivating defendants to engage meaningfully with rehabilitative services.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

At this point, it is appropriate to record observations made in the recent correspondence from the Southwark Retail Crime Reduction Scheme. This organisation, formed in 2018 in response to persistent acquisitive crime pressures, operates on the frontline of victim support, offering training to staff and liaising closely with police units. Their October 2024 annual report identified a worrying trend: a 15% increase in thefts affecting small independent outlets, many under-resourced and ill-equipped to resist repeated offending by well-practised individuals exploiting routine shifts and vulnerabilities. The report emphasises that although single events may involve low monetary values, the aggregated losses impose serious financial stress, threatening business viability and local employment.

The court additionally familiarises itself with recent data compiled by the Strategic Policing and Crime Board relating to acquisitive crime, which reveals mounting pressures on duty officers, many diverted from investigations into violent crime or counter-terrorism by the incessant need to address street-level theft and disorder. This resource competition challenges all aspects of policing effectiveness and, by extension, public confidence.

A broader societal backdrop must not be ignored. As this court has remarked in prior sentencing remarks in similar cases, societal phenomena such as growing income inequality, long-term unemployment, and housing insecurity provide an inescapable context which—while not excusing offending—frames the conditions in which such crimes occur.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

It is also salutary to recall key sentencing considerations promulgated in the definitive Sentencing Council guideline on theft offences, which stipulates tiers of culpability based not only on economic value but also on harm sustained by victims and the wider community. The guideline notably recognises that repeat offending and calculated dishonesty exacerbate culpability, as does targeting vulnerable businesses or employing sophisticated evasion techniques.

The court has drawn upon the well-known judgment of R v Jones [2017] EWCA Crim 1678, a shoplifting case which, while differing in factual detail, reinforced the proposition that a breach of trust, particularly by repeats offenders, justifies a degree of increment beyond baseline penalties applicable to first-time or isolated incidents.

It is also pertinent to mention the decision in R v Connors [2015] EWCA Crim 438, where the Court of Appeal underscored the appropriateness of custodial sentences in cases wherein offenders showed disregard for court warnings and previous interventions—finding that the protective and deterrent elements of sentencing demanded firmness.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Prior to addressing the specific facts of the offending and considering an appropriate penal response, it is important to observe that the mental health evidence in the present case is comparatively limited. A psychological assessment commissioned by the defence, undertaken by Dr Helena Rios, Clinical Psychologist, confirmed that Mr H does not suffer from any recognised mental disorder. However, traits consistent with impulsivity and low frustration tolerance were noted. Dr Rios also commented on the apparent absence of proactive problem-solving skills and occasional emotional dysregulation, conclusions which the probation report echoed. Neither report suggests an imminent risk of harm to others, though both counsel for attention to emotional support interventions as part of any rehabilitative sentence.

The court further notes a letter submitted on behalf of the defendant’s sister, Ms Patricia Williams, expressing concern for her brother’s living situation and recommending family mediation support. While this familial input is welcomed and may be considered during sentencing, it is not determinative.

Additional correspondence from the local charity ‘CarePoint’, which specialises in supporting individuals at risk of homelessness, draws attention to chronic pressure on housing services, prolonged waiting times for secure accommodation, and the strain these factors impose on persons in precarious housing situations such as Mr H’s. These systemic challenges bear upon the broader narrative but do not mitigate criminal burden.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

The court is also minded to record observations made in relation to Law Enforcement Agency Practice regarding the deployment of resources for acquiring and preserving evidential material. The reliance on publicly accessible CCTV footage, while often viewed as an investigative panacea, is fraught with limitations. Signal degradation, camera blind spots, and inconsistent time-stamping frequently impede clear offender identification, necessitating corroboration through other means—be it witness descriptions, physical evidence, or forensic analyses.

The role of the Metropolitan Police Forensics Unit deserves recognition. Despite persistent budgetary constraints, the Unit has employed advanced methods such as footwear print analysis and fibre-transfer detection with commendable outcomes. Such technical developments enhance evidential solidity but must be balanced against timeliness and proportionality.

It is regrettable that these demands often slow proceedings. While technological support has indeed expanded investigative possibilities, it ironically contributes to prolonged case management and listing backlogs. This case has witnessed none of the severe delays commonly seen but serves as a reminder of the system’s complexity.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

On the matter of sentencing options, the Sentencing Council’s guideline identifies a range of potential disposals tailored to the gravity of offending and identified risks. Community and custodial sentences both remain viable, contingent on the evaluation of public protection needs, harm inflicted, offender culpability, and rehabilitative prospects.

The defendant’s prior record contains convictions solely for shoplifting offences, with the most recent dating back to 2021 for which a conditional discharge was imposed. There is no evidence of involvement with organised crime, violent behaviour, or other forms of aggravating conduct beyond the recurring pattern of theft.

The court emphasises the need for sentencing to reflect both specific deterrence—addressing the defendant’s own propensity to offend—and general deterrence, which underpins public trust and guards against the normalisation of acquisitive crime.

The court is increasingly aware of the pressures facing the Probation Service, which is operating under significant staffing shortages and expanded case loads arising from recent legislative changes. These challenges impede the ability to deliver intensive supervision or specialised programmes, particularly in urban centres.

Despite these systemic difficulties, the probation team managing Mr H’s case has indicated a willingness to engage with all available rehabilitative resources. A consideration of a community order incorporating a rehabilitation activity requirement is therefore being actively explored.

It is, however, critical that any community-based provision be genuinely structured and enforceable, avoiding a repeat of well-documented issues where voluntary arrangements fail to secure meaningful change.

The court is mindful of ancillary matters that occasionally arise tangentially in such cases but remain irrelevant to sentencing. For example, recent attention has been drawn by local press to the protest actions outside the Southwark Magistrates’ Court concerning the conditions of bail. While these political expressions highlight important concerns, they bear no relevance in the present proceedings.

Similarly, unrelated criminal matters involving co-defendants in distinct cases—such as a recent conviction for criminal damage involving installation damage to a public noticeboard at St Leonard’s Church—must not distract from the individual assessment required here.

Further, commentary within legal circles on the impact of social media platforms—particularly where influencers document their own minor legal encounters—while topical, applies variably and is neither determinative nor particularly germane to the present materials.

Moreover, the court notes with some disappointment the cessation of a city-wide scheme to monitor fly-tipping and environmental offences, which, though unrelated, has diverted some municipal enforcement resources previously available for preventative initiatives addressing retail crime.

In these broader social dynamics, one perceives the complexity faced by institutions endeavouring to balance resource allocation amid competing priorities.

In conclusion, while acknowledging the limited mitigating features present, the cumulative effect of the offending, the impact on victims, and the defendant’s prior record suggest that a custodial sentence cannot yet be discounted. Equally, robust community interventions designed and monitored with clear expectations may offer the best prospect of rehabilitation and future crime reduction.

The court will therefore request the probation service to compile a detailed pre-sentence report outlining risk assessments, available interventions, and a recommended disposal reflecting the gravity and context of the offending. The report should address potential suitability for a community order incorporating unpaid work and cognitive-behavioural therapy designed to address acquisitive offending patterns.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 6 of the Crown Court at Southwark. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to relevant authorities. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
