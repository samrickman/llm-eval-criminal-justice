IN THE CROWN COURT AT EPSOM  
R v. MR H  
Case No. E2025/14387  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. L. BROOKS  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction on a single representative count of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge represents a pattern of offending over an extended timeframe, during which you engaged in repeated shoplifting incidents across multiple independent and chain retail outlets in the Surrey Hills area.  

Procedural History  
Your case was transferred from the Magistrates’ Court to this Crown Court pursuant to the Serious Acquisitive Crime Protocol, given the multiplicity and persistence of offending, alongside the complexity of the evidential picture compiled by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. Your arrest took place on 14 May 2025, following an investigation led by the Surrey Hills Business Crime Reduction Unit, who acted upon intelligence reports and coordinated liaison with affected retailers. This multi-agency effort was designed to assemble a comprehensive offender profile and facilitate a timely prosecution.  

Such cases, though appearing minor at first glance, invariably generate significant cumulative burdens on the justice system, commercial retailers, and local communities. The volume and repetition of theft, regardless of individual item value, merit considered judicial response due to the broader disruption caused. It is notable, regrettably, that offences of this nature occupy an outsized proportion of policing resources and trigger extensive administrative work in preparing disclosure for the defence and court. The detailed examination and verification of CCTV footage, witness accounts, and forensic evidence are time- and labour-intensive. While advances in digital forensics have improved evidential accessibility, the cost—both in monetary and human terms—remains significant.  

On 20 May 2025, you were interviewed under caution. Initially, you denied involvement but later admitted to the offences in interview following presentation of indisputable security footage. You were charged on 28 May 2025 with multiple counts consolidated into the single charge now before this court. The case progressed through the Better Case Management (BCM) process in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules.  

The BCM initiative is intended to reduce delays, ensure early identification of issues requiring expert input, and promote meaningful engagement by all parties. It was with some measure of appreciation that this court noted the efficient conduct of case progression. Hearings, including plea and trial preparation, were listed within standard indicative timeframes, albeit with some adjournments occasioned by the defence's late disclosure of additional mitigating materials and a succession of Legal Aid funding requests.  

I acknowledge counsel on both sides for their professional diligence. Ms Sarah Williams appeared on behalf of the Crown with commendable clarity and thoroughness, while Mr Adam Feldman represented you, securing legal aid under a representation order. The delays occasioned by repeated and protracted Legal Aid Agency correspondences drew judicial observation. Requests to instruct a forensic psychologist specialising in acquisitive offending were met with administrative inertia, necessitating multiple resubmissions and delayed authorisation by over four weeks. Such procedural hurdles, though regrettably recurring in this jurisdiction, cannot be said to assist the administration of justice, nor the timely disposal of your case.  

It is a well-documented reality that the current climate of constrained public funding, combined with increasing caseloads and staffing shortages, places unacceptable strain on the Legal Aid system. The capacity and responsiveness of this agency go directly to the heart of the right to a fair and expeditious hearing, especially where expert opinion materially informs sentencing outcomes.

Against the backdrop of your proceedings, it is worth noting that the Surrey Constabulary has reported a 23% increase in recorded retail theft incidents over the past three years. Much of this increase is accounted for by repeat offending and the proliferation of third-party handlers who profit from stolen goods. The Business Crime Reduction Unit has expressed concern about declining staff morale and the increasing reticence of smaller retailers to engage with police investigations, citing fears of intimidation and a lack of confidence in securing effective sanctions. Such systemic challenges inevitably permeate individual cases, amplifying their significance beyond the immediate factual matrix.  

The legal framework within which I must exercise my sentencing function includes reference to the Theft Act 1968, the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences promulgated in 2018, and relevant case law. The Theft Act establishes the core elements of the offence: dishonesty, appropriation, property belonging to another, and the intention to permanently deprive. The present charge is predicated on these elements, with evidence showing clear intention, premeditation, and repeated breach of trust toward commercial operators.

In interpreting the sentencers’ discretion in such cases, I consider the guidance set out in R v. Ellis [2023] EWCA Crim 2021, which took into account the cumulative effect of multiple episodes of shoplifting, the vulnerability of victims involved, and the defendant’s previous record. The Court of Appeal emphasised the proportionality of sentencing in the context of the offender’s personal circumstances balanced against the need for deterrence and public protection.  

Similarly, R v. Cartwright [2022] EWCA Crim 1195 underscored the importance of distinguishing between opportunistic, one-off offences and protracted patterns of theft that demonstrate planning and calculated behaviour. While the nature of the property stolen may be modest in individual transactions, the overarching conduct often warrants a custodial or community-based rehabilitation sentence, depending on mitigating factors.  

It is also appropriate to note, briefly, the principles articulated in R v. Sandover [2020] EWCA Crim 871, where the Court cautioned against an overly lenient view of repeat acquisitive offenders on the grounds of purported financial hardship. The judges recognised the interplay between socio-economic factors and criminal behaviour but reaffirmed the necessity of upholding public confidence through consistent and appropriately robust sentencing.  

Of course, relevant precedent encompasses cases far beyond theft alone. Reference may be made to R v. Martell [2017] EWCA Crim 618, involving aggravated burglary with no direct connection to your case, but which nevertheless informed principles of credit reduction for late guilty pleas and the balance of risk and rehabilitation. These tangential references serve to illustrate the broader contours of sentencing jurisprudence within which this court operates.  

Turning to the detailed evidential record, the facts of the offending are as follows:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

The incidents involved various retail locations, including well-known convenience stores, pharmacies, and a small independent grocery operated by a local cooperative. Supermarket security footage demonstrates a pattern of conduct involving concealment of goods beneath clothing and in personal bags, timed to coincide with periods of staff distraction and shift changes. Staff witnesses have provided statements corroborating the footage and detailing the emotional toll exacted by your repeated visits and the consequent heightened workplace vigilance. Several employees reported increased anxiety and altered rotas to mitigate opportunities for theft during times you were likely to attend.

There is evidence of the removal or deactivation of security tags on merchandise, and some incidents involve coordination that suggests either pre-existing knowledge of shop layouts or a degree of sophistication in undermining in-store loss prevention measures.

The victim impact statements produced by the affected stores describe not only financial losses but also the cumulative effect on staff morale and the delicate balance of trust required in small retail operations, particularly those run by community cooperatives or charitable organisations.

The Crown highlights that, despite prior diversionary initiatives and a community resolution in 2023, you have persisted in this course of conduct, thereby undermining the preventative intent of rehabilitative efforts.

Expert Assessments and Ancillary Reports  
I have had the benefit of a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Fiona Kavanagh, a consultant clinical psychologist with expertise in criminogenic behaviour relating to acquisitive offences. Dr Kavanagh’s assessment, dated 12 September 2025, is thorough, professionally composed, and notes that you do not suffer from a diagnosable major mental illness. However, traits of impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and elements of mild substance use — specifically in relation to alcohol on weekends — were identified. Dr Kavanagh observed that these factors may exacerbate risk but do not wholly account for your offending pattern. She further noted a lack of engagement with mainstream social support services, including those providing assistance with budgeting, housing, and employment, despite multiple referrals from police liaison officers and welfare agencies.  

The report recommends a programme of cognitive behavioural therapy focussed on addressing impulsivity and decision-making, coupled with closer monitoring by probation services and the potential inclusion in a community-based drug and alcohol support scheme, though the clinical priority is on behavioural change rather than medical intervention.  

It bears mention that the local probation service is operating under intensive pressure, with reduced staffing levels due to recruitment shortfalls and increased caseloads across a broad spectrum of offenders. You are to be commended in general terms for the cooperation of the probation officer assigned to your case, Ms Heather McBride, who has diligently produced a pre-sentence report amid these systemic difficulties. That report, circulated on 10 September 2025, articulates the challenges facing individuals like yourself, highlighting particularly the multiplicity of unmet social needs alongside enduring offending behaviour. The officer notes your current residency in temporary accommodation provided by the Surrey Housing Authority, the receipt of limited welfare benefits, and the absence of stable employment. The report expresses concern over your failure to fully engage with offered support services — a finding consonant with Dr Kavanagh’s psychiatric observations.  

In the preparation of this report, Ms McBride has consulted with several voluntary sector agencies, including SafeStart Surrey, a charity specialising in supporting individuals at risk of repeat acquisitive offending. Their recent letter to this court acknowledges your involvement but emphasises your reluctance to participate in scheduled programmes aimed at debt counselling and work readiness.  

It is an unfortunate but persistent reality that the vast majority of defendants in cases such as yours are offered access to such resources or similar, yet compliance rates remain modest. The reasons for non-engagement vary but may include distrust of formal institutions, the chaotic nature of some individuals’ daily lives, and coexisting struggles with mental health or substance use disorders. Nonetheless, the system cannot indefinitely extend assistance where willingness on the part of the recipient is wanting. The balance between support and accountability remains a fundamental tension within criminal justice.  

This court has also received correspondence from the Surrey Retailers’ Federation dated 3 September 2025, expressing collective frustration at repeated theft incidents within the jurisdiction. They demand stronger deterrents and highlight the disproportionate impact on small, independent outlets which lack the resources to implement extensive security measures. While their position is understandable, it is also notable that they acknowledge the efforts of local police and courts to deal expeditiously with such matters, validating the present prosecution in the eyes of the business community.  

I should note the timely intervention of the Legal Aid Agency in authorising the funding for expert psychologist Dr Kavanagh was secured only after persistent applications by your defence team. The delay occasioned represents but one example of the broader institutional bottlenecks impacting the administration of justice in this locality.  

It would be remiss not to acknowledge that in R v. McAllister [2019] EWCA Crim 1531, the Court of Appeal reiterated the principle that delays in expert reports due to administrative difficulties should not count against the defendant when assessing credit for plea or cooperation. Nonetheless, the extended procedural timespans inevitably create anxiety and uncertainty for all parties involved.  

It has also been brought to this court’s attention in recent months that the Surrey Constabulary’s Digital Forensics Unit operates at near-full capacity, with a backlog of cases awaiting review. While this has not directly affected this case, it reflects systemic pressures that indubitably inform the pace and manner in which criminal investigations, particularly those dependent on CCTV analysis and mobile device examination, proceed at the local level.  

The court further notes the absence of co-defendants in this matter. However, it is worth recording that a recent unrelated prosecution in the adjacent district of Banstead, heard in February 2025, involved a co-defendant who failed to appear after being charged with an aggravated violent offence, prompting a warrant for arrest. Such examples, while tangential, serve as cautionary tales regarding the risks of non-compliance. Your own acquiescence to the process is therefore a procedural positive but must not be conflated with substantive mitigation.  

Victim and Community Impact  
The residual impact on retail staff and owners resulting from your offending cannot be understated. While the property values involved may appear modest in isolation, the repetitive nature of the offending has caused tangible distress. The court was provided with statements from a number of employees who reported feelings of vulnerability and emotional strain, leading in one case to staff turnover and in another to requests by shop managers for additional training in conflict avoidance and security awareness.  

One victim, a proprietor of a family-operated convenience store, described having to invest in additional security infrastructure at personal cost, an expense not readily recuperated through insurance or public grants. The cumulative economic effect, alongside the disruption to daily operations, merits serious consideration in sentencing.  

It is an unfortunate truth that acquisitive crime at this level often escapes the sustained public attention that more sensational offences attract. There are no headlines or headlines-grabbing narratives. Yet the quiet attrition upon ordinary lives and community spaces is no less real. Indeed, there is a growing body of academic scholarship emphasizing the corrosive effect of such persistent offences on social cohesion and trust, with particular reference to the erosion of perceived safety in local commercial environments.  

Sentencing Considerations  
In determining an appropriate sentence, I bear in mind the applicable statutory provisions, the Sentencing Council’s guidelines, and the principles well established in case law. The prolonged and repetitive nature of your offending, the effect on victims, and your previous criminal record weigh heavily in the overall calculus.  

Mitigating your culpability, the court notes your eventual acceptance of guilt and the absence of violence or threats in the commission of these offences. Your personal circumstances, including financial hardship and unstable housing, are relevant contextual factors, although, as noted above, they do not excuse persistent offending or refusal of available support.  

Previous case law reiterates that early plea affords significant discount. The courts are, however, increasingly reluctant to grant full credit where pleas come after the accumulation of evidence renders contest untenable. Your initial not guilty plea delayed the earlier conclusion of proceedings and imposed additional burdens upon witnesses and the system.  

The report from Ms McBride recommends that any sentence include a supervisory element accompanied by tailored cognitive behavioural programmes aimed at reducing reoffending through structured support and monitoring. It further advocates exploring access to employment and housing services in parallel.  

It is the court’s view that a purely punitive approach is unlikely to serve the broader objectives of rehabilitation and public protection. Conversely, unwarranted leniency risks failing the victims and community who bear the brunt of these offences. The sentence must therefore strike a balance between deterrence, rehabilitation, and proportionality.  

The court is mindful that in the current socio-political climate, the overextension of custodial sentences for low-level acquisitive crime is a subject of legitimate debate. Nonetheless, the facts of your case, taken cumulatively, approach a threshold where immediate custody or a substantial community order merits serious consideration.  

In advancing towards sentence determination, I shall seek an updated pre-sentence report incorporating any further recent developments, in particular your engagement with support services and any change in circumstances. The probation service is directed to assess the feasibility of a Community Order with a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, inclusive of cognitive skills work and substance misuse support, alongside potential unpaid work obligations.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Epsom. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant agencies. You are reminded of your right to appeal against sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs remain reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
