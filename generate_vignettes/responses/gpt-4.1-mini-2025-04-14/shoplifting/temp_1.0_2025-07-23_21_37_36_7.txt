IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/14503  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge B. L. Wainwright  
Filed: 18 August 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence in respect of an indictment charging you with theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, arising from a series of shoplifting offences committed over a protracted period extending from late 2023 through to the early months of 2025. The Crown alleges that your offending took place primarily within the greater Manchester area, encompassing a variety of retail establishments from convenience stores to independent pharmacies.

Procedural Background and Investigative Overview  
Your arrest followed the conclusion of a lengthy and multifaceted investigation commenced by the Greater Manchester Police Retail Crime Unit in conjunction with local licensing bodies and supported by the Manchester Business Crime Reduction Partnership (MBCRP). The partnership, established in 2012, seeks to coordinate law enforcement, retailers, and community safety teams to deliver a coherent response to the chronic problem of retail theft and associated consequences for victims and vulnerable communities.  
One recognises that such partnerships, though ostensibly proactive, often struggle against myriad operational challenges: limited staffing, competing priorities, and the administrative burden inherent in collating and distributing intelligence products. The MBCRP has over the years developed platforms for shared reporting and facilitated multi-agency meetings; however, feedback from participating retailers frequently cites variable responsiveness and a lack of real-time enforcement action. While it is not for this court to arbitrate these complex dynamics, it is fitting to acknowledge the work of those who seek to create an effective framework amid enduring constraints. On this occasion, the collaborative effort successfully culminated in your identification and eventual apprehension.

Procedural steps have followed the standard trajectory for business crime cases of this nature. Initial charges were laid following your interview under caution, conducted on 3 April 2025, at which point you denied the allegations. Subsequent forensic examination of the seized items of clothing, including footwear and outer garments noted on several security videos, facilitated a link between you and multiple incidents. You were formally charged on 15 April 2025. The matter was transferred to this Crown Court list under the Better Case Management provisions, which aim to ensure expeditious handling of cases, particularly those with voluminous evidentiary materials.

Owing to a defence application for disclosure clarification and the instruction of expert evidence, the case has seen several adjournments. While such procedural delay causes frustration among all involved, it is regrettably common in cases requiring comprehensive technical assessment and diligent preparation by legal representatives.

In this regard, an application was made on 11 May for Legal Aid funding to instruct a forensic psychologist with expertise in acquisitive offending and associated mental health issues, to assess your suitability for community-based sentencing. The Legal Aid Agency’s processing of this request, which, regrettably, extended through June with multiple rounds of requests for additional information, exemplifies ongoing administrative challenges within that system. The resulting delay underscores systemic vulnerabilities in access to specialist input that courts and practitioners repeatedly encounter.

Various witness statements, including those from retail staff, have described the adverse effect your offending has had on their work environment, company policies, and emotional wellbeing. The Crown also called upon representatives of the Manchester Retail Rights Coalition, who have been active in lobbying for enhanced local measures to combat recurring shoplifting and its spillover effects on public perceptions of safety.

The Better Case Management process for shoplifting offences, as codified in Part 3 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, facilitates an allocation of responsibility across prosecuting authorities, defence counsel, and the court to ensure efficient preparation for trial or plea. Here, full disclosure was served by 2 June, and a case management hearing was convened on 10 June 2025. It was noted at that hearing that your plea remained not guilty; however, the Crown anticipated a realistic prospect of conviction based on evidential strength.

A plea and trial preparation hearing scheduled for 20 July had to be vacated following a late application by defence counsel to admit character references and family statements. Subsequent listing fixed today’s date for sentence following your own late guilty plea, entered on 12 August 2025.

Considerations on the Court’s Role and the Broader Societal Context  
It would serve no proper judicial purpose to deliver a reductive enumeration of the theft counts alleged. Rather, this court must situate the offending within the broader social and institutional context in which such offences arise and recur. It is now well-established that shoplifting, albeit often minimised in popular discourse, has real, palpable impacts far beyond the immediate transactional loss. Staff may endure increased stress and anxiety, often multiplied by inadequate resourcing and high turnover. Retailers face shrinking margins, compounded by insurance pressures and reputational harm. Ultimately, local economies suffer.

Studies commissioned by the National Retail Federation in 2024 underscore a worrying upward trend in petty theft incidents, correlating with economic fluctuations, poverty indicators, and social fragmentation. Multiple agencies, including the Probation Service, have signalled the strain placed by serial acquisitive offenders on rehabilitation resources, necessitating bespoke interventions that link offending behaviour with underlying causes such as substance misuse, mental health issues, financial exclusion, and housing instability.

The court is also conscious of the unheralded but sterling work undertaken by the Manchester Shopfront Support Network, a coalition of volunteers providing practical advice and emotional aid to shopkeepers affected by retail crime. In their representations, the Network highlighted the frequent sense of helplessness amongst their members, caught between the necessity to safeguard premises and the absence of robust systemic backing.

It is a truism that judicial sentiment cannot replace legislative or policy action; yet the courts remain at the fulcrum where societal reflection and individual accountability must be balanced. It bears emphasizing that accusations implying wholesale culpability based on socio-economic status risk clouding the fact that offending choices are made against that backdrop. Explaining causes cannot be conflated with excusing conduct.

At this juncture, it is pertinent to recall that your offending pattern was characterised by calculated targeting of vulnerable retail outlets. An intelligence profile assembled by the police and the local business watch groups revealed not only repetitions in time and place but also similar modus operandi. Tactics appear to have included the use of concealed compartments within jackets and backpacks, along with purposeful timing during periods of staff shift change.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

The pattern of offending, as indicated by statements from shop personnel, was psychologically impactful despite an absence of physical threat or violence. The cumulative stress led to at least one employee seeking a transfer, and others reporting diminished job satisfaction. This is consistent with findings in occupational studies such as the 2022 Manchester Retail Health Survey, which links repeat store theft to elevated rates of anxiety and absenteeism.

It warrants acknowledgement that your offences differ materially from some ancillary criminal activity proliferating in the wider borough, including an unrelated spree of fly-tipping on green belt land in the Upper Cheshire area. While the latter represents a serious environmental regulatory breach prosecuted separately and adjudicated in 2024, it holds no connection to your conduct save as a reminder of the multifarious nature of criminality taxing local resources.

A further consideration, alluded to earlier, concerns the role of mental health and rehabilitative assessment in informing sentencing outcomes. Following your conviction, a psychiatric evaluation was undertaken by Dr Harriet Cullen, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, who submitted a comprehensive report dated 29 July 2025.

The report notes that you do not meet criteria for any major psychiatric disorder, but identifies features consistent with impulsive behaviour and emotional dysregulation. There is mention of a history of mild depressive episodes, attributed in part to socio-economic instability and fractured family relationships.

Dr Cullen further recommends that any custodial sentence, should one be imposed, be supplemented by validated rehabilitative programmes targeting offending-related cognition and behavioural patterns. However, she also notes the need for continued social support to address housing and employment barriers. Such observations align with current probation service priorities but rely heavily on the availability of sufficient funded interventions—a facet of systemic capacity often in flux.

The sentencing framework for theft offences is articulated clearly within the current Sentencing Council guidelines, which necessitate a careful assessment of culpability, harm, and mitigating or aggravating features. Given the multiplicity of offences involved, the court must balance the overall criminality of the conduct against the personal circumstances and the prospects for rehabilitation and deterrence.

Having regard to the statutory framework governing reductions for guilty pleas, the principles established in R v. Gibbons [2019] EWCA Crim 1234 remain instructive. There, the Court of Appeal reasserted that credit for a guilty plea must correspond proportionally to the timing and sincerity of the admission. Late pleas, especially those entered at or shortly before trial, are entitled to less credit than early, unqualified admissions.

It is worth noting that your plea was only tendered after the completion of forensic evidence testing and the service of full disclosure. While it spared the need for a contested trial, it does not reflect the expeditious acceptance of responsibility this court would ordinarily hope to encourage.

Several letters of support have been submitted on your behalf, including correspondence from staff at the Manchester Homeless Outreach Project and Crisis Together, two voluntary sector organisations providing front-line assistance in the city. These letters testify to your engagement with limited services offered, although contact remains inconsistent.

The Pre-Sentence Report prepared by Ms Emma Rogers, probation officer, dated 12 August 2025, provides extensive background on your social history. At 32 years of age, you have a record including prior convictions for theft and a community order issued in 2021 for similar offending. You remain unemployed and report intermittent accommodation in temporary housing.

Case supervision was curtailed in 2023 after you disengaged from allocated services. Attempts to re-establish contact were hindered by frequent changes to telephone numbers and unstable living conditions. Ms Rogers highlights this as a significant challenge to effective rehabilitation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

The defendant’s family environment is described in the report as complex, with some estrangement and ongoing unresolved conflicts, particularly concerning a sibling who faces unrelated criminal proceedings for benefit fraud and was recently remanded on remand conditions that include curfew and monitoring. Such familial issues, while potentially impactful, do not diminish personal responsibility.

The report also flags a history of substance misuse, primarily alcohol, that has contributed to difficulties in maintaining employment and stable accommodation. Referral to specialised addiction treatment has been recommended.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

The Crown has emphasised the cumulative harm arising from your ongoing pattern of acquisitive offending, noting the disproportionate drain on police and community resources. Particular reference is made to the considerable time spent by analysts reviewing digital evidence, the costs associated with enhanced store security measures, and the distress caused to retail workers and customers.

By way of illustration, this court recalls the well-regarded judgment in R v. Moreton [2020] EWCA Crim 1783, which addressed persistent theft involving offending at transport interchanges in the West Midlands. The court there underscored that continuous offending, even absent violence, had wider community impacts that demanded sentences reflecting the need for both deterrence and rehabilitation.

In your case, the evidence points towards sustained, deliberate and opportunistic theft affecting multiple business premises. Had your offending involved more violent or threatening conduct, the sentencing range — and consequential custody threshold — would, of course, be significantly higher.

The court must further consider the impact of your offending on the confidence of the local population in the security of their shopping environment, an intangible but genuine harm recognised in contemporary sentencing literature.

Charges against co-defendants or associates linked to other unrelated investigations, such as a separate case involving aggravated affray at a licensed premises in Denton during a New Year’s Eve disturbance in 2023, are noted in the records but hold no relevance to your conduct or culpability, and will not be considered here.

In approaching sentence, the court acknowledges advocacy from your counsel who has highlighted factors including your personal difficulties, efforts to engage with support agencies, and indications that this offending stems partly from economic desperation.

Nonetheless, it behoves this court to apply the law with measured firmness. Repeat acquisitive offending must be met with consequences that both protect the public and encourage genuine desistance. It is evident that prior community disposals have not been successful in altering your behaviour.

The court commends the thoughtful approach taken by counsel on both sides, including Ms Amina Halkani appearing for the Crown and Mr Jonathan Bellamy appearing on your behalf. Both have provided detailed and reasoned submissions, reflecting the time-honoured adversarial process, even in cases of this nature.

The physical layout and arrangement of this courtroom, recently refurbished through public funding allocations in 2024, has facilitated an efficient hearing today. Court ushers and clerical staff have likewise contributed to the smooth administration of justice, for which the court is thankful.

In summary, the matters before this court are complex, mixing legal, social, and individual factors against a backdrop of community harm not always apparent in the telegraphed charge sheet.

I shall, therefore, adjourn sentence pending the full benefit of the pre-sentence report, including further exploration of your amenability to intervention and any updated clinical assessments that may assist the court in tailoring an appropriate disposal.

This sentencing hearing is adjourned to a date to be fixed, at which time all relevant reports and representations must be brought before the court. This court emphasises that any deviation from strict deadlines must be supported by cogent reasoning and with counsel’s cooperation.

These sentencing remarks are entered on this 18th day of August 2025, in Court 6, at Manchester Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of their statutory right to appeal this sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
