IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEICESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. LCR 2025/13658  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J. Eastwood  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing following your conviction in respect of shoplifting offences under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charges relate to a series of thefts committed over a considerable time frame, involving multiple retail premises within the Leicester city centre and surrounding boroughs. This court has given careful consideration to the facts as proven, the reports filed on your conduct, and the relevant sentencing guidelines, all of which will inform the deliberations that follow.

Procedural History  
Your case was initially listed for a preliminary hearing on 19 May 2025 but was adjourned on application of the defence to facilitate the commissioning of a psychiatric assessment to explore underlying factors potentially relevant to sentencing. The court notes the additional delays occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency’s prolonged processing of the grant for instructing an independent forensic psychologist, a matter which gave rise to considerable inconvenience and delay in progressing these proceedings. Cross-referencing correspondence submitted indicates significant administrative backlog at the Agency’s headquarters throughout the spring and early summer months, which, while regrettable, is an issue beyond this court’s immediate remit but worthy of formal remark.

Following receipt and consideration of the psychiatric report from Dr Martin Ellison, consultant forensic psychiatrist, the matter was relisted for plea and trial preparation hearing on 14 July 2025. At that hearing, you tendered a guilty plea to the sole representative count embodying a course of conduct charge. The Crown and the defence have both submitted detailed position statements, and there has been the benefit of a probation report summarising your background, risk factors, and rehabilitation prospects. This hearing is listed to consider the appropriate disposal.

It is worth noting that these proceedings have been conducted under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, duly adopting the protocols which seek to avoid excessive delay, reduce unnecessary court time, and promote timely case resolution. Although this case has not proceeded with optimal expedition owing to the factors detailed above, the court has noted the efforts of the prosecution team, led by Ms. Caroline Finch, and the defence, represented by Mr. Andrew Cole, to keep the case moving forward in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules provisions on timetabling and case management.

The court is conscious of the burden placed on the wider justice system by matters of this nature, including the demands upon police, forensic analysts, and retail security staff, all of whom have contributed evidence or operational input. The Leicester Business Crime Partnership, in particular, made considerable efforts to provide victim impact statements and electronic submissions reflecting the cumulative effect of shoplifting incidents on local businesses and their employees. These contributions are noted with the seriousness they deserve.

In addressing the legal context, the court acknowledges that section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the cornerstone legislative provision against which these offences are prosecuted. The actus reus of the offence is the appropriation of property belonging to another, dishonestly, with the intention to permanently deprive. The nature of shop theft as an aggravating offence lies in its repetitive potential and the wider implications for victim businesses, local communities, and the sense of public order.

Notwithstanding the ostensibly "minor" monetary value involved in individual transactions, the courts have long acknowledged the significant cumulative impact of persistent retail theft on small and medium enterprises. In R v. Galloway [2017] EWCA Crim 2004, allowing a custodial term for persistent shoplifting where the defendant targeted elderly retailers, the court emphasised the wider social and economic harm, even where the sums involved were modest.

A further important authority is R v. Trent [2022] EWCA Crim 1323, where the defendant’s use of diversion techniques and covert collaboration with co-offenders was held to escalate culpability despite relatively low individual item values. This principle is germane insofar as consideration of modus operandi and planning often informs sentence severity in acquisitive offences. Although co-defendants are not involved in your case, the principle remains apposite.

Legal precedents dealing with the timing and character of guilty pleas consistently reinforce that early pleas are more likely to attract substantial credit than those entered at a late stage, close to trial. The Court of Appeal in R v. Ferguson [2019] EWCA Crim 1187 restated the importance of early acceptance of responsibility and the effect on sentencing mitigation.

The Crown has submitted that your plea, though entered in a timely fashion relative to many acquisitive crime cases, occurred only after the Crown’s evidential case had been substantially developed. The defence contends that the plea reflects genuine remorse and a wish to engage constructively with the court process.

In terms of background and risk, the probation pre-sentence report paints a complex picture. You are a 34-year-old man with several previous convictions, including three for theft-related offences dating back over five years, but no prior custodial sentences. You are currently unemployed and residing in supported accommodation provided by the city council. The report notes sporadic engagement with support services and hints at ongoing substance misuse concerns, particularly with alcohol, for which you have not consistently sought or accepted treatment.

The volatile nature of your familial relationships and a history of childhood instability may contribute to understanding, though not excusing, your conduct. The reports emphasise your ambivalence toward intervention and a measured assessment by specialists that engagement with rehabilitative programmes is critical if reoffending is to be curtailed. This challenge is not unique and echoes long-standing systemic issues within probation and social support networks.

Notably, the court has received letters from the Leicester Community Aid Group outlining their efforts to offer assistance with financial management and housing stability, but these letters acknowledge the limitations imposed by underfunding and stretched personnel. Such challenges are widely recognised in the public sector, exacerbated in recent years by budget cuts and increasing caseload demand.

The wider societal context of these offences cannot be overlooked. National statistics published recently by the Home Office indicate a steady increase in retail theft reports, with a marked impact on independent traders, some of whom have had no option but to curtail opening hours or reduce staffing levels, leading to broader community effects.

Similarly, it is worth recalling the complex evidential and procedural challenges posed by modern retail crime. CCTV footage, while invaluable, often suffers from poor quality, intermittent coverage, and accessibility issues due to varying store policies and third-party data protection concerns. This court notes with appreciation the dedication of the Leicester Police Retail Crime Unit, whose officers have balanced these investigative demands with other pressing priorities, including serious violence and organised crime.

It is also pertinent to note that the current case has been affected by administrative delays related to the temporary absence of a probation officer assigned to your file, who was placed on administrative leave following an unrelated internal disciplinary proceeding. This occurrence, while unconnected to your matter, exemplifies the complexities and vulnerabilities of public services relied upon in cases such as yours.

The court makes no criticism, merely an observation, that such external pressures invariably have knock-on effects on case management, report preparation, and the capacity of officers to provide consistent supervision.

The psychiatric assessment by Dr Ellison, commissioned at the defence’s request, sets out carefully reasoned conclusions. While dismissing any diagnosis of major mental illness, it notes a pattern of impulsivity and poor coping mechanisms in relation to stress and financial hardship. The report suggests that these vulnerabilities might be amenable to structured community-based intervention programmes, should you consent to participation.

The report also highlights episodes of low mood and social isolation, factors often common in repeat offending cohorts but not sufficient to amount to diminished responsibility or mitigation warranting departure from conventional sentencing principles.

The court is also aware of the national shortage of funded places for such interventions, as well as long waiting lists within substance misuse programmes. This systemic shortfall is a vexing issue to which no easy solution is apparent, though criminal justice agencies and partners continue to strive to optimise service delivery within means available.

In determining sentence, it is necessary to balance the seriousness of the conduct against both personal mitigation and the broader public interest. The persistent infringement upon the business community’s economic and psychological wellbeing weighs heavily. This court is acutely conscious of the growing number of cases in which vulnerable employees report heightened anxiety, and in some cases require trauma support, as a consequence of recurrent acquisitive offending.

Among the evidence presented, statements from shop floor staff and managers demonstrate not only tangible loss through stolen goods but also intangible damage—staff turnover, increased security expenditure, and diminished customer confidence. These are attendant consequences too often overlooked in formulaic sentencing considerations.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

It is worth reflecting that the court has before it several victim correspondence letters, including one from Ms Priya Desai, manager of a community pharmacy, who articulates the fear and disruption occasioned by repeated thefts targeting over-the-counter medication, some of which is integral to vulnerable customers’ wellbeing.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

The pattern of your offending reveals a troubling disregard for such consequences. Multiple incidents show a modus operandi involving concealment of goods within personal bags and intermittent use of distraction tactics. These techniques suggest a degree of premeditation and sophistication beyond a spur-of-the-moment misjudgement.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

Although your counsel has endeavoured to contextualise your actions within a narrative of financial hardship and chaotic personal circumstances, the court must stress that such context does not excuse the calculated breach of the law inherent in your conduct.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

The court has also reviewed the pre-sentence report’s recommendations regarding rehabilitation programmes. In line with this, engagement with a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) course addressing impulsivity and decision-making is advisable. Such an intervention targets underlying behavioural tendencies that contribute to acquisitive offending but requires your willingness and commitment.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Likewise of note is the report’s observation that financial instability and lack of employability skills compound the risk of recidivism. Liaison with community employment schemes and budgeting advice services may support desistance.

Some of these support features might be valueless or even unobtainable in jurisdictions where social funding has been drastically reduced. It is imperative that courts, practitioners, and supporting agencies pursue collaborative efforts to bridge these gaps wherever possible.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Turning to your previous convictions, it is clear that despite earlier warnings, cautions, and a conditional discharge issued in mid-2023, similar offending behaviour has persisted without significant interruption. This pattern demonstrably increases culpability and suggests limited deterrent effect from prior interventions.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

In reaching its conclusions, the court has also been mindful of unrelated criminal matters posited in ancillary briefing and legal argument. Cases such as R v. Langley [2018] EWCA Crim 1789, dealing with serious child sexual offences, and R v. Hobbins [2020] EWCA Crim 1404, concerning aggravated robbery with violence, were cited by defence counsel in passing, seeking comparative mitigation.

Such analogies, while legally noted, carry no persuasive weight here. The gravity of those offences and their attendant societal harm are vastly distinct from the theft course before this court and are not germane to the assessment of culpability or appropriate sentencing level for acquisitive crime.

Similarly, mention of co-defendants in entirely separate proceedings involving possession of bladed articles at school premises, fly-tipping on protected green belt land, and theft of copper cabling from railway depots serve only as peripheral noise—irrelevant to your individual responsibility or risk profile.

The court is also aware of ongoing investigations into matters connected tangentially to your extended family, including a sibling’s involvement in a benefit fraud inquiry. I emphasise no connection between those allegations and your current case, but enumerate these observations to capture the comprehensive nature of information considered.

Your case also coincided chronologically with an unfortunate arson event in Court 4 of this complex, which delayed listing options temporarily. While this is regrettable, it is an externality unrelated to your proceedings but indicates the multifaceted demands placed on court resources.

It is further regrettable that the assigned probation officer who compiled your pre-sentence report was herself temporarily suspended following a complaint concerning conduct unrelated to client matters, a circumstance necessitating reassignment and ultimately contributing to report preparation delays.

In the face of systemic pressures, it is appropriate to thank the court staff, ushers, and court clerks for their steadfast commitment to maintaining orderly proceedings and proper record-keeping during challenging periods.

Similarly, credit is due to the judiciary administration team that has striven to accommodate the increased caseload, notwithstanding the recent refurbishment of this courtroom and the necessary introduction of upgraded security protocols which, while fortuitous in the long term, have added logistical complexity to daily sittings.

The court notes, without elaboration, that the defendant's letter to the court was presented in neat handwriting and was thoughtfully composed, expressing remorse and the wish to make amends.

It is imperative to note the importance of sound record-keeping and judicial transcription services, which assisted this court in maintaining a clear contemporaneous record of all submissions and findings, ensuring compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

In conclusion, this court is tasked with imposing a sanction reflecting the gravity of your offending, the need for deterrence, both personal and general, the protection of the public, and the promotion of your rehabilitation. The court is acutely mindful that custodial sentences for acquis
