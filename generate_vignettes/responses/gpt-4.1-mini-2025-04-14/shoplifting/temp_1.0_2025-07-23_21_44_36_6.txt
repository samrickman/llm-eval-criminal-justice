IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14439  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. G. STERLING  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing following your conviction on a representative charge of theft, specifically relating to shoplifting offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The pattern of offending materialised over a period spanning eighteen months and encompassed multiple commercial premises located within the Manchester metropolitan area, including both high street retailers and smaller independent businesses.

Procedural Background  
The proceedings in your case were initiated by your arrest on 12 April 2025, following an extended and multi-layered investigation coordinated by the Manchester Business Crime Unit (BCU) acting in collaboration with local police ward teams and the Greater Manchester Retail Crime Alliance. This enquiry involved the collation of evidence deriving from various sources: closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage; witness statements collected by store managers and retail staff; and forensic analysis including the examination of clothing and personal belongings seized during a search of your residence under warrant. The investigative effort was notable for its breadth and cross-agency dimensions, with input from retail security experts as well as digital forensic specialists.

The wider context within which these offences occurred is one marked by a constant challenge to retail establishments in urban centres, where resource limitations among police forces and pressures on community safety teams have conspired to render even apparently minor acquisitive crimes disproportionately taxing in terms of investigative time and manifold operational resources. It is well understood within law enforcement circles that shoplifting, whilst routinely dismissed as "low-level" or "victimless," in fact imposes a persistent strain on staff wellbeing, store security, and ultimately the viability of smaller independent businesses that serve local communities. This case typifies the strain visited upon the system in such circumstances.

A plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 15 May 2025. You entered a not guilty plea at that stage. However, the trial was listed for 14 July 2025 in this court, at which point you tendered a guilty plea, accepted by the Crown as appropriate. It is regrettable but not uncommon, as this court has observed in many matters of this kind, that pleas are delayed until the eve of trial, diminishing the opportunity for meaningful victim engagement and protracted judicial economy. This phenomenon has been judicially scrutinised in the Court of Appeal, including in R v. Saunders [2023] EWCA Crim 1712, where it was highlighted that belated pleas impact heavily upon the administrative and emotional burden borne by victims and services.

The Legal Aid Agency's involvement in the pre-trial phase warrants mention. The initial application for funding to instruct a forensic clinical psychologist to produce a report addressing key areas of risk, mitigation, and rehabilitative pathway suitability was met with considerable delay. Despite timely submission on 22 May 2025 by Mr Alan Grieves, defence counsel, the funding authorisation was not granted until 2 July 2025 and placed under close scrutiny, involving multiple rounds of correspondence which considerably postponed the producing of an expert report on your mental health and risk profile. Such procedural encumbrances, while not determinative, are symptomatic of systemic challenges confronting Legal Aid administration and expose not only defendants but the courts and counsel to unnecessary burden. This court reiterates the calls endured for reform aimed at streamlining expert evidence authorisation to ensure timely progress.  

It is also significant to remark on the ongoing pressures affecting the Probation Service. Current staffing shortages and elevated caseloads—as reported in the Probation Board’s annual review of 2024—have impeded the rapid preparation of pre-sentence reports. The present matter is scheduled for sentencing on 5 October 2025, pending receipt of the Probation Service’s assessment, which will address risk, personal circumstances, and the feasibility of community supervision options.

Broader Context  
We are now in an epoch characterised by persistent strains across statutory and voluntary agencies alike. The National Business Crime Reduction Framework (NBCRF) continues to pursue the integration of data-sharing protocols and cross-sector liaison. Yet the reality remains that in many localities the challenge of inter-agency coordination is complicated by varying levels of institutional memory and resource allocation. The Greater Manchester Safer Communities Board report of 2023 noted ongoing gaps between strategic intent and operational delivery. Meanwhile, frontline retail staff endure elevated incidents of low-level theft, sometimes complicated by threatening or intimidating behaviour, highlighting the psychosocial toll beyond mere monetary loss.

Meanwhile, local voluntary sector organisations, such as the Manchester Retail Recovery Network (MRRN), have sustained efforts to provide support and advocacy for affected business owners and employees. Their written submissions in this case evidence their cautious optimism toward rehabilitation initiatives but note concerns about repeat offenders who demonstrate inconsistent engagement with intervention programs.

Procedural Digressions  
The court is also mindful that the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme under the Criminal Procedure Rules continues to evolve. The precise implementation of BCM in this case was broadly compliant with Rule 3.1’s objectives regarding early disclosure, management of expert evidence, and trial preparation. However, the inevitable adjournments occasioned by late disclosure of CCTV footage and the Legal Aid delays referenced earlier inevitably compromised the overall efficiency to some extent.

A notice to the court dated 10 August 2025 from the Lancashire Criminal Defence Solicitors Association detailed recent issues with court listing constraints owing to industrial action and simultaneous complex hearings in neighbouring jurisdictions, contributing to the bottleneck in trial availability. While unrelated directly to this case, these factors are a relevant backdrop to understanding contemporary procedural realities.

Further anecdotal correspondence from the office of the local Retail Crime Commissioner (issued 3 September 2025) highlights the enhanced use of intelligence-led policing initiatives to tackle frequent offenders. The correspondence drew attention to data compiled from 2023-2024 indicating substantial increases in retail theft reports in metropolitan boroughs similar to Manchester, particularly among demographics vulnerable to economic hardship. It is a matter of judicial record that repeated acquisitive offending is often a proxy for deeper socioeconomic and public health challenges.

It may also be noted for completeness that the court received a letter dated 7 September 2025 from the Defendant’s sister, Mrs Joanne H., articulating her support for engagement with community resources and expressing hope for a rehabilitative outcome in this matter. Such communications, while genuinely heartfelt, do not displace the due consideration to be accorded to the offending conduct before the court.

Legal Framework and Relevant Authority  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the statutory underpinning for the offences with which you have been convicted. The key elements—dishonesty, appropriation, belonging to another, and intention to permanently deprive—were established beyond reasonable doubt.

The Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences (effective from November 2023) categorises seriousness according to a range of criteria including the value and nature of the goods stolen, the frequency and premeditation involved, and aggravating factors such as targeting vulnerable victims or employing threats.

Notably, the Court of Appeal’s decisions in R v. Foster [2022] EWCA Crim 954 and R v. Doyle [2024] EWCA Crim 1013 demonstrate the courts’ increasing insistence on proportionate deterrent sentencing in cases exhibiting persistent offending patterns. Foster concerned repeated theft of electronics from commercial outlets, with noted disruption to staff welfare; Doyle involved a series of thefts from pharmacies, where the defendant exploited situational vulnerabilities to facilitate concealment.

Also relevant is the decision in R v. Brandt [2019] EWCA Crim 687, involving environmental regulatory offences with consequential community harm. Although pressingly different in nature, the Court of Appeal there emphasised the cumulative impact of repeated disregard for law and social order, an aspect resonant here.

The line of authority in R v. Grantham [2023] EWCA Crim 1209, relating to community-based disposal where appropriate, also informs the contextual approach to sentencing balance—recognising rehabilitative potential in tandem with public protection.

The facts, as presented, indicate a level of sophistication as well as a persistent engagement in acquisitive offending, underscoring the need for a clear sentencing response. The matters set out in the prosecution evidence and corroborated by CCTV footage, witness testimony, and seized property, portray a calculated and repeated course of conduct which impacted multiple victims.

It is critical to note that while some offences of shoplifting may attract community sentences or conditional discharges, the present case’s chronicity and the defendant’s prior convictions place this case in a more serious category.

It should also be mentioned that your choice of premises, which included both chain and smaller independent retailers, means the financial damage was not confined to large corporate entities with financial buffers, but also to community businesses with limited margins, often staffed by precarious employees.

The victim impact statements received from affected shops describe not only the direct monetary losses but the broader consequences such as staff anxiety, increased security costs, and reduced customer footfall.

I further note with concern that the offending behaviour involved strategies to evade detection, including the deliberate removal and manipulation of anti-theft devices, ostentatious use of mobile phones to distract staff, and returning to specific stores despite warnings.

Expert Reports and Risk Assessment  
The report furnished by Dr Jacqueline Evans, consultant forensic psychologist, provides valuable insight into your mental state and risk profile. While not diagnosing any major psychiatric disorder, Dr Evans identifies personality traits consistent with impulsivity and adaptability, with significant difficulties in controlling immediate gratification impulses. She notes a pattern of minimising the impact of your behaviour and a limited capacity to benefit from unstructured community intervention without holistic support.

Dr Evans highlights the absence of any diagnosed substance misuse disorder but describes some historical association with casual alcohol consumption, noting that it does not appear to be a direct causative factor in the offending.

I also take into account the probation officer’s preliminary briefing, which underscores the fragmented nature of your engagement with social support services. While there has been some sporadic contact with employment and housing advice agencies, there is no sustained or meaningful participation. The Probation Service anticipates exploring the suitability of a structured community order encompassing cognitive skills training and potentially, where feasible, restorative justice components.

Your age, 34, and previous conviction history for related acquisitive crimes are material. The Probation Service further advises that no known safeguarding concerns exist in relation to children or vulnerable adults linked directly to you, and there is no evidence of coercive or exploitative associations.

Regarding housing, it is noted you reside in temporary accommodation secured via the city council. The precarious nature of this tenancy may inform aspects of personal instability but does not materially mitigate culpability when measured against the offending conduct.

Broader Observations  
It is appropriate, if somewhat tangential, to observe that the court’s broader experience is one of increasing complexity in dealing with repeat acquisitive offenders, many of whom navigate intersecting challenges beyond the criminal justice system—such as mental health difficulties, substance use, and socioeconomic deprivation. Efforts to enhance multi-agency coordination continue but are hampered by overburdened systems.

The current landscape of legal aid, public health provision, and housing support remains fragmented. The court is acutely aware of the systemic pressures on NHS mental health services, particularly psychological therapy provision, which results in substantial waiting lists and inconsistent access. Such realities inevitably influence the prospects and timescales of rehabilitation, though they do not eclipse individual accountability.

In this connection, it is worth noting the significance of volunteer-run community groups like the Justice and Rehabilitation Network, who supplement statutory efforts through tailored mentoring, advocacy, and practical assistance. Such organisations often operate under severe funding constraints but nonetheless provide essential continuity for some offenders.

Procedural Notice  
This sentencing hearing has proceeded in open court, attended by all parties—Crown counsel Ms Sonia Khatri, and defence counsel Mr Alan Grieves, instructed pursuant to a representation order granted in March 2025. The court thanks both counsel for their clear and professional submissions.

Lastly, it is germane to mention the court’s awareness of contemporaneous unrelated matters: for instance, serious delays in court listings occasioned partially by a protracted arson investigation in a neighbouring venue, and an unrelated case of significant import involving a defendant convicted for burglary of a private dwelling while the owners were abroad. While extraneous here, such matters contribute cumulatively to courtroom pressures and affect listing allocations.

Sentencing Outlook  
Having regard to the totality of the circumstances—the nature of the offending, your personal circumstances, the expert opinions and probationary advice—the court is minded to give serious consideration to the imposition of a custodial sentence. However, mindful of the potential for rehabilitation and the limited mitigating features you present, sentencing will be deferred pending receipt of the full pre-sentence report.

I direct the probation officer to prepare an assessment exploring all credible sentencing options, including: custodial sentence with community rehabilitation post-release; a community order incorporating rehabilitative modules targeting offending behaviour; and structured unpaid work requirements. The report should also speak to risk of reoffending and public protection concerns, the availability and your likely engagement with community resources, and any further information on your social and family support networks.

I emphasise that the final sentence will be determined on the basis of the complete body of evidence, including any updated reports and representations subsequently made.

These sentencing remarks are issued on this 18th day of September 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Manchester. The proceedings have been formally transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded appropriately. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal the sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged at this time. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
