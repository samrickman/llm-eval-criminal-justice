IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13427  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge C. J. POMEROY  
Filed: 12 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence in relation to a matter concerning a sustained course of shoplifting offences, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending, spanning a duration exceeding eighteen months, comprised multiple incursions into various retail establishments throughout the metropolitan areas of Manchester, Salford, and Stockport.

Procedural History  
Your initial appearance was recorded on 7 February 2025, following arrest on 3 February under suspicion of repeated theft by appropriation. The investigation that led to your apprehension was notable for its multi-agency coordination, involving officers from the Manchester City Policing Unit, the Regional Business Crime Intelligence Branch, and technical detectives within the Greater Manchester Digital Forensics Team. This level of collaboration, while laudable in its aims, does reflect the substantial resource allocation that offences of this nature can demand. Despite the relatively low monetary value of individual items, the accumulation of such offences strains policing capacity, particularly when victim businesses are small trades disproportionately affected by shrinkage.  

It is well established that cases involving serial shoplifting rely heavily on diligent evidence gathering rather than the flash of spectacular proof. This often results in a procedural tedium where the prosecution must exhibit the fruits of protracted surveillance, CCTV analysis, and complex witness statements spanning several retailers and dates. Such demands extend to lengthy disclosure schedules and the management of voluminous exhibits, much to the exhaustion of court staff and practitioners alike.

The Better Case Management (BCM) framework was engaged promptly, with the matter eventually listed for a plea and part-heard trial preparation hearing on 19 March 2025. Following motions from the defence for further expert psychiatric assessment and delay occasioned by legal aid authorisations, the trial was adjourned, culminating in a plea hearing held on 1 September 2025, at which you entered a plea of guilty.  

The importance of early pleas is underscored in sentencing jurisprudence, not least in the context of retail theft, where the costs to public bodies, victims, and witnesses multiply with delay. Credit for plea is necessarily commensurate with the timeliness and sincerity of the admission, as reiterated in authorities such as R v. Faraday [2023] EWCA Crim 789 and R v. Shelton [2022] EWCA Crim 556.

It is regrettable though that notwithstanding your eventual plea, you elected to maintain a not guilty stance until the eve of trial, thereby impinging on forensic witness preparation and necessitating further pre-trial assembly of case law submissions and victim statements.

The court acknowledges the representation order granted to Mr George P. Honeywell, instructed through the Legal Aid Agency. I must, however, record continuing concerns with the administrative delays encountered in securing funding for independent expert reports. Despite timely applications, approval for psychiatric evaluation was deferred repeatedly, delaying the sentencing process and fostering inefficiency detrimental to all parties.

It is worth recalling the complexities attendant upon the administration of justice in cases such as this. Contemporary courts wrestle with increasingly bureaucratic demands, competing professional obligations, and dwindling resource allocation. Inter-agency cooperation, whilst essential, often generates additional procedural layers and communication challenges. The present case was no exception, with a protracted exchange of correspondence between defence, prosecution, probation, and psychiatric services before the necessary documentation was secured.

The Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP) has been one of the key contributors to the investigative process. Meeting minutes dated 14 January 2025 document the partnership’s role in collating intelligence from retail outlets, facilitating rapid response alerts, and providing victim impact reports. Such multi-sectoral collaborations are intended to generate a seamless interface between commerce, law enforcement, and community protection. However, as practitioners and scholars have observed (see Malik and Khan, “Retail Theft and the Business Crime Response,” Policing Journal, 2024), operational inconsistency and data-sharing constraints sometimes limit the full potential of these schemes.

The court’s appreciation extends also to the outreach teams from the Salford Community Partnership, who submitted impactful victim statements reflecting the economic and psychological toll borne by affected shops. Their detail, compassion, and commitment were evident throughout.

That said, amidst these laudable efforts, one cannot ignore that the systemic under-resourcing of such voluntary and statutory bodies remains a barrier to robust community safeguarding. The strain on outreach workers and local authority services, combined with a rising need for mental health interventions nationally, composes a challenging backdrop against which offences like those committed by you unfold.

The judicial exercise is one not only of adjudication but reflection — on the nexus of social factors, individual autonomy, and public interest in maintaining law and order. It is not the court’s remit to attribute causation for every aspect of offending behaviour; yet a discerning account must recognise that such behaviour often arises within complex, interrelated contexts of social disadvantage, substance misuse, and unstable accommodation.

It would be a superficial justice to consider the facts in isolation from the reality that some defendants stand before the court contending with multiple vulnerabilities. Yet, these vulnerabilities do not excuse criminal conduct, nor do they obviate the necessity of a proportionate response.

Precedents of relevance include R v. Sobel [2019] EWCA Crim 333, where the Court of Appeal delineated the principles governing sentencing for repeat shoplifting, emphasising deterrence alongside rehabilitative opportunity. A fine balance must be struck to safeguard victims and the wider community without forsaking the prospect of individual reform.

I also bear in mind R v. Tibbetts [2020] EWCA Crim 256, which concerned repeat offences involving theft from small businesses, underscoring that the cumulative impact on persons providing essential services is a salient aggravating factor.

Turning now to the facts, which are set out in detail within the trial bundle and associated exhibits:

The facts presented offer a comprehensive narrative with supporting evidence including digital recordings, witness statements, and forensic traces.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

Television media is often quick to overlook the quotidian harms occasioned by shoplifting, focusing instead on spectacular or violent crime. Yet the cumulative impact on small businesses, already operating under precarious economic conditions, is no less real. Indeed, loss prevention officers play a quietly heroic role, often balancing customer service with the stress of confronting frequent theft attempts. The psychological toll on such individuals is well documented in multiple academic studies, including the “Hidden Wounds Report” (2023).

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

The court has also had before it detailed victim impact statements supplied by several shop managers, all emphasising not only financial loss but also the indirect effects on staffing levels, workplace morale, and customer perception of safety.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

It is evident that the stores targeted were disproportionately small and community-oriented — family-run shops, pharmacies, and niche grocers — rather than large chains, indicating a level of awareness as to the vulnerability of the premises selected.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

A salient point before the court is that your conduct included the premeditated removal of security tags and the use of deceptive distraction techniques, illustrating an awareness of, and intent to defeat, security measures.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

This is not an uncommon modus operandi in the world of retail theft, where offenders seek to minimise detection through a variety of stratagems. Yet the court must emphasise that sophistication in offending exacerbates culpability rather than mitigating it.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Previous disposals have been explored in the evidential material, including a community resolution for similar theft in 2023, which unfortunately failed to deter further offending. That fact is significant in assessing the overall verdict for culpability and the required sentencing response.

Psychiatric and Probation Assessments  
Dr Bryony Mallick, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, provided a report dated 15 July 2025. Her assessment indicates that you do not suffer from any formal mental disorder but noted elevated traits of impulsivity and an immature coping style. There was no evidence of significant psychosis, affective disorder, or intellectual disability. Treatment recommendations included engagement with cognitive-behavioural therapy aimed at impulse control and addressing criminogenic thinking patterns.

The pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Mr Iqbal Allaby, dated 27 August 2025, categorises you within a moderate risk of harm and reoffending. It highlights your inconsistent engagement with offered support services, citing missed appointments and a general reluctance to participate in structured programmes. Housing instability was noted, with your current accommodation lacking permanence.

Local probation resources continue to be heavily stretched. This court acknowledges national disparagement regarding the level of funding and staffing available to criminal justice social work teams. Despite these constraints, practitioners strive commendably to deliver tailored rehabilitative interventions, often partnering with community initiatives.

Relevant legislation directs the court to consider rehabilitation potential alongside public protection. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences (2022) articulates a framework balancing factors such as culpability, harm, and mitigating circumstances, notably recognising the role of plea timing and personal circumstances.

This court has had the benefit of submissions on behalf of the Crown from Ms Jyoti Patel, who ably advanced the prosecution case and stressed the importance of deterrence in situations of serial acquisitive offending. Mr Honeywell, appearing on your behalf, candidly addressed the court with mitigating submissions referencing your current difficulties, the late plea, and the absence of violent conduct.

The broader societal context is not lost on this court. The pressures wrought by inflation, housing shortages, and cuts to social welfare, especially across Greater Manchester, bear heavily on many individuals traversing the justice system pathways. Yet, as this court has observed in multiple sentencing remarks, national policy challenges cannot become a talisman justifying unlawful behaviour. The maintenance of civil society depends upon adherence to the rule of law and recognition of individual responsibility within communal frameworks.

Incidentally, this court notes the recent refurbishment to the courtroom layout, designed to improve accessibility and security for vulnerable witnesses. Such improvements, though peripheral to individual cases, form part of the ongoing efforts to modernise judicial infrastructure.

Returning briefly to case law, R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, concerning a defendant with schizoaffective disorder and arson convictions, reminds us of judicial caution in differentiating therapeutic need from the necessity of incapacitation. Though the facts differ starkly from the present matter, the principles espoused regarding balancing treatment and public safety remain pertinent.

Equally, R v. Haslow [2021] EWCA Crim 1754, involving importation of controlled substances concealed in vehicles, serves as a jurisdictional anchor for the principle that offences involving sustained and complex offending patterns merit measured response. While drug trafficking cases are a distinct category, the notion of sentencing in light of cumulative behaviour and late pleas applies here by analogy.

The present case has not been impeded by delays in disclosure, which is to the credit of the prosecution team, corroborating the procedural diligence expected in BCM-listed trials. Cooperation amongst parties has, notwithstanding standard administration challenges, been satisfactory.

It is important to remark on the unfiltered frustrations sometimes encountered with the Legal Aid Agency's procedures for authorising expert reports. Despite repeated attempts, this court finds the procedural labyrinth detrimental to timely justice delivery. The strain it places upon both defence counsel and court timetables is not inconsequential. Calls for reform remain pressing.

The litigation surrounding co-defendants, unrelated to Mr H, emerged during case progression. One co-defendant failed to appear and is currently at large, whilst another was found to have a separate, unrelated indecent images charge. Those matters bear no relevance to the sentencing deliberations concerning you but remind us all of the complexities of joint enterprise proceedings.

Victim impact statements included a letter from the proprietor of the Newton Green Pharmacy, expressing concern over repeated thefts of medicinal products impacting service delivery to vulnerable customers. The landlord of a shop unit targeted was simultaneously subject to a noise abatement notice arising from an unrelated tenant dispute, providing no bearing on and no mitigation for the present case.

Your personal circumstances have been represented through a letter from your sister, Mrs Bernadine Williams, tendered during the recent adjournment. While reflecting familial concern, these notes—whilst heartfelt—cannot substitute for consistent personal reform.

Turning finally to the factual matrix underpinning your conviction:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

The court recognises, and I emphasise, that the pattern of offending exhibited betrays an intentional and sustained disregard for the property rights of others and the economic stability of small retail businesses. The behavioural traits and circumstances described in expert reports underscore the necessity for a sentence that balances accountability with the potential for rehabilitation.

I hereby order the preparation of a pre-sentence report to assess the full scope of suitable interventions, including but not limited to cognitive behavioural programmes addressing acquisitive offending, substance misuse treatment pathways, and stable housing facilitation. An evaluation of your engagement potential with reparation schemes will also be considered.

This sentencing hearing, conducted in open court, has thus far been characterised by the customary professional diligence one expects in Crown Court proceedings. I record my thanks to counsel on both sides and to all supporting agencies.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. The proceedings have been fully transcribed and digitally archived pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentencing order will be forwarded to the National Offender Management Service and relevant registries. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal the sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
