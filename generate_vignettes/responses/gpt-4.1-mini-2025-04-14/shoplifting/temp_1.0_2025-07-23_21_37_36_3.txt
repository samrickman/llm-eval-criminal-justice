IN THE CROWN COURT AT GREENBRIDGE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. Y2025/11347  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. D. CRANSTON  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence after having pleaded guilty to offences of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. These offences represent a pattern of conduct over an extended period, involving several retail locations within the county of Greater Greenbridge.

Procedural Background  
Your case has traversed an unusually protracted path to sentencing. Following your arrest on 21 May 2025, the matter was first listed before the magistrates’ court at Ashbourne on 12 June 2025. Due to the seriousness and pattern of offending, the magistrates wisely committed the matter to this court for sentence. Early progression was hindered by difficulties obtaining adequate funding through the Legal Aid Agency, particularly for a forensic psychiatric evaluation sought by your legal team. This application was initially refused on 5 July but subsequently approved on 23 July 2025 following extensive advocacy by your solicitors. The delay occasioned thereby postponed listing from August into this month.

The Formalisation and operation of Better Case Management (BCM) protocols within this court have, to their credit, been observed in principle, but with some practical delay due to overlapping workloads and staff shortages. On 11 August 2025, a Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing took place, at which you entered a not guilty plea. However, upon disclosure of further CCTV footage and witness statements, you changed this to a guilty plea on 1 September, reflecting acknowledgment of the incontrovertible case against you. As is rigorously established in law, the timing of guilty pleas bears heavily on sentencing mitigation, a principle underpinned by decisions such as R v. Campbell [2023] EWCA Crim 592 and the seminal authority of R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029.

Judge Cranston will note, with not inconsiderable disappointment, the cumulative strain placed on the criminal justice system through late pleas in cases of this nature, which exact an undue toll on limited resources, delay justice for victims, and impose unnecessary hardship upon witnesses called to testify. The guidance set forth in R v. Lawrence [2022] EWCA Crim 1901 is instructive, underscoring that credit for pleas given at the eleventh hour must be carefully measured.

It must further be acknowledged that this court is presently operating amid a landscape of unprecedented challenge. Staffing shortages in the Probation Service have resulted in stretched caseloads averaging in excess of eighty clients per officer. NHS mental health services face historic waiting lists, particularly in forensic psychiatry and addiction treatment referrals. Collaboration across multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) also faces significant administrative burdens. These systemic factors do not excuse or mitigate individual offending behaviour but must be borne in mind when considering the broader framework of support and rehabilitation.

The Deputy District Judge presiding over the earlier hearing on 12 June duly noted the commendable support of the Greenbridge Business Crime Reduction Partnership (GBCRP). This entity has coordinated efforts between retail premises, local law enforcement, and community outreach teams, facilitating timely collision of evidential material. It is a hallmark of good practice that such partnerships exist, though their operation often strains against the realities of fluctuating funding, staff turnover, and emergent priorities such as gang violence and serious acquisitive offences, which siphon police capacity elsewhere.

It is regrettable that, despite the efforts of the GBCRP and local policing teams, repeated thefts occurred from premises that had already implemented heightened security measures. This suggests, at a minimum, a degree of brazenness and disregard for the deterrents ostensibly in place.

In the context of these proceedings, it is fitting to observe that police investigative work in shoplifting prosecutions is far from straightforward. Officers must grapple with incomplete footage, unreliable witness recall, and the logistical difficulty of assembling cohesive case files from multiple retail sources. The work of digital analysts, now a core aspect of evidence collation, is burdensome. The Greater Greenbridge Police Department’s Digital Forensics Unit reported an approximate backlog of 82 device analyses at the end of June 2025 alone, a statistic that encapsulates the growing operational challenges facing law enforcement. That said, the evidence in your case was clear and compelling.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

I am informed that the retail outlets involved include independently run pharmacies and smaller corner shops. While cases involving major chain supermarkets and department stores frequently attract media attention, it is important to remember that smaller retailers often bear a disproportionate share of the economic and psychological impact of persistent shoplifting.

Indeed, correspondence before the court from the Northfield Retailers’ Association paints a vivid picture of operational distress: staff departures, curtailed opening hours, and anxiety over personal safety. A letter dated 3 September 2025 specifically details the reluctant measures some stores have taken, including the installation of costly additional CCTV equipment and the adoption of tagging systems affecting customer convenience. The economic consequences of retail shrinkage—defined as loss of stock due to theft, error, or fraud—have been linked in academic literature to destabilisation of local economies and increased insurance premiums.

It is tempting, of course, to view shoplifting as a victimless crime. This court demurs emphatically. The consequences extend beyond immediate loss; they affect employment, community cohesion, and social trust. To refer to the sociological critiques articulated in the report “Retail Crime and Urban Policy” (University of East Midlands, 2023), such offending, even at a small scale, aggregates detriment that ripples through broader social networks.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Regarding your personal circumstances, the pre-sentence report compiled under Probation Officer Ms Joanna Lestein’s supervision, dated 8 September 2025, offers a detailed narrative of your background, character, and risk profile. Ms Lestein’s report acknowledges your lack of prior violent offending and minimal history of custody, but also highlights recurring patterns of acquisitive crime beginning in your late teens. She observes limited engagement with previous community sequenced interventions and a discernible pattern of non-compliance with proposed support services.

It is, however, instructive that you have recently expressed willingness to participate in cognitive-behavioural programmes aimed at offending behaviour, a development which the probation service views as cautiously hopeful. This court encourages such engagement, noting the increasing evidence base supporting the efficacy of structured rehabilitative initiatives in reducing recidivism, including the “Enhanced Thinking Skills” programme pioneered in Surrey during 2022.

Consideration must also be given to the psychiatric assessment provided by Dr Javier Marquez, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose report dated 2 September 2025 was obtained following an order on 9 July 2025. Dr Marquez found no evidence of major mental illness but noted pronounced features consistent with borderline personality disorder traits, along with episodic depressive symptoms and indications of alcohol misuse. He emphasised your history of unstable housing and strained family networks as significant contextual factors, yet ultimately concluded that the risk of serious harm to others is low in the absence of substance misuse exacerbation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

The report from Dr Marquez is accompanied by supplementary observations from the Greenbridge Substance Misuse Outreach Service, which records intermittent attendance and limited engagement with prescribed interventions. This pattern reflects a wider problem within substance misuse services nationally, where attrition rates approach 40% within the first three months of referral, a statistic that undoubtedly colors risk assessment and rehabilitation planning.

The evidence before this court must also be placed alongside a short history of previous sentencing remarks in comparable shoplifting cases at this court and elsewhere. For instance, the decision in R v. Greenwood [2024] EWCA Crim 993 established that persistent shoplifting from vulnerable independent retailers warrants sentences that reflect not only the monetary loss but also the emotional toll experienced by proprietors and employees. Mr Greenwood’s case involved multiple offences spanning eighteen months, with numerous prior community sanctions. The Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 14 months’ immediate custody, highlighting the need for deterrence and safeguarding.

Similarly, R v. O’Connor [2023] EWCA Crim 755 concerned a 29-year-old repeat offender with substance misuse issues, sentenced to 10 months’ imprisonment after conviction for thefts involving distraction techniques and removal of security tags. The court noted the aggravating factors of targeting disabled staff and using knowledge of store layouts to facilitate offending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

Turning to the specifics of your case, I have taken full account of the representations made on your behalf by Mr Andrew Fielding, your instructed defence solicitor. Mr Fielding has submitted a letter dated 10 September 2025 urging the court to consider your difficult social circumstances, the impact of unstable accommodation, and to give weight to your expressed willingness to engage with treatment and rehabilitative services. These matters are germane but do not diminish the gravity of the offending.

The Crown, represented by Ms Clare Hammond, has provided a careful outline of the aggravating and mitigating factors, stressing the calculated and repeated nature of the thefts, the distress caused to staff members, and the apparent indifference to prior warnings and community resolutions. Ms Hammond fairly acknowledges the absence of violence and your cooperation since pleading guilty.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

It is imperative to record, with collective gratitude, the invaluable input of the Victim Liaison Unit, whose officers have met with staff adversely affected by your conduct. Their reports convey the significant emotional strain endured and reveal instances of increased anxiety culminating in staff absences. These impacts, while intangible in monetary terms, deserve recognition as part of sentencing considerations.

I am also afforded representations from the Greenbridge Housing Support Network, which underscores the systemic housing challenges within the locality. It has been widely reported that the municipality currently has over 1,200 households in temporary accommodation, including a significant number residing in unsuitable emergency placements. These structural failings contribute to social vulnerability but cannot be treated as exculpatory.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

In considering all the material, it is relevant to emphasise the court’s role as articulated in the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, last revised in 2023. The guideline identifies key factors impacting the seriousness of offences, including frequency, degree of planning, sophistication of concealment, and the effect on victims. Precedent, notably R v. Bhandari [2023], also stresses the need to balance rehabilitative prospects with public confidence and demand for deterrence.

The court must also be mindful of the broader societal context alluded to earlier. Recent years have seen increasing public concerns about retail crime and anti-social behaviour. Reports by the Crime and Policing Analysis Unit (CPA) at Greenbridge University note that petty acquisitive offences, including shoplifting, hamper commercial regeneration efforts, undermine community safety perceptions, and thereby contribute to a slow erosion of social capital in affected neighbourhoods.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

In assessing your culpability and appropriate sentencing pathway, I reflect upon the factors set down in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the overarching principle of proportionality, and the need to consider public protection, deterrence (both specific and general), rehabilitation, and reparation. While the offences are non-violent, their persistency and impact on vulnerable retailers represent significant considerations.

The possibility of custodial punishment cannot be lightly set aside. However, given your expressed remorse and willingness to contemplate structured interventions, community-based sentences incorporating rehabilitation requirements may be viable if adequately supported by Probation Service recommendations.

To this end, the court will direct the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report (PSR) with particular focus on risk factors related to your offending, the suitability of community-based interventions, and prospects for sustained compliance with treatment programmes. Probation officers are requested to consider structured Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), substance misuse treatment frameworks, and financial management support schemes.

This sentencing hearing has proceeded in open court, with both prosecution and defence fully represented. I wish to record my thanks to Ms Clare Hammond for the Crown and Mr Andrew Fielding on behalf of the defence for their measured and professional submissions. Staff in the administration and court ushering teams are also acknowledged for their assistance in facilitating effective proceedings. The courtroom’s recent refurbishment, including the improved sound system and enhanced access for persons with disabilities, is a welcome improvement to the facility’s accommodation standards.

I also note the presence of court interpreter services, which, albeit engaged subsequently, ensured procedural fairness for all concerned. Although no significant representation was required on language grounds in this matter, the ongoing availability of such provision remains vital as demography evolves.

It is regrettable that delays occasioned by Legal Aid administration remain a persistent feature in cases such as this. The court must again express concern that procedures intended to ensure proper oversight and cost control can result in unintended, but significant, impediments to timely justice. The need for structural reform in this area is well-documented and remains a concern for the judiciary.

Before concluding, it bears mention that this court is acutely aware that the crime of shoplifting, while often regarded as minor by the public, entails adverse consequences extending beyond the immediate economic loss. Morale among retail employees, feelings of personal vulnerability, and the broader deterrence message sent by the justice system are at stake.

These sentencing remarks, prepared and issued today, 18 September 2025, are made in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Greenbridge. The proceedings are transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record will be communicated to the pertinent bodies for enforcement and oversight.

You are advised that you have a right of appeal against any sentence imposed within 28 days, pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions engaging under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 or otherwise are made.

Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
