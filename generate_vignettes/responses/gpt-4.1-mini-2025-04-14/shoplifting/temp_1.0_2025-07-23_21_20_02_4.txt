IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/03891  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. E. Cartwright  
Filed: 15 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence on a charge of theft by shoplifting contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct in question spanned a period of just over eighteen months, with the principal locus including several retail premises within the Manchester city centre and adjacent boroughs, notably Salford and Trafford. The charge, as presented, represents a sample count indicative of the course of conduct alleged and now admitted.  

Procedural History  
Your initial appearance before the magistrates’ court occurred on 3 June 2025. At that time, the charge was formally read, and you entered a not guilty plea initially. The case was then committed to this Crown Court for sentencing after your plea was altered to guilty at a subsequent hearing on 30 September 2025. The change of plea came following extensive case management hearings and after consultation with your legal representatives. The period between this court’s receipt of the case and today has involved considerable procedural steps, including the formulation of a detailed pre-sentence report, psychiatric assessment, and victim impact statements.  

This matter was allocated to this jurisdiction as part of the Manchester Crown Court’s efforts to implement the Better Case Management protocols introduced under the Criminal Procedure Rules aimed at improving case progression, timeliness, and the quality of evidence-led prosecutions. The case management hearings were listed on 10 July and again on 14 August 2025, with these sessions facilitating disclosure, expert evidence examination, and consideration of admissibility and plea discussions. The court acknowledges the efforts of all professionals involved in securing a just and timely resolution, notwithstanding the often burdensome and cumbersome nature of practice in acquisitive crime prosecutions.  

Reference must be made, not without some regret, to certain delays attributable to the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative processes. Counsel for the defence submitted a formal application for funding to instruct a forensic psychiatrist—namely Dr Elaine Worthington, a consultant with over twenty years’ experience in offender psychiatric assessment—in mid-July 2025. Unfortunately, the approval for this expert instruction was not issued until early September, substantially prolonging the case timetable. Such delays are, regrettably, symptomatic of wider systemic resource constraints that can impede defendants’ ability to secure appropriate expert input and thereby hinder the court’s capacity to render informed sentencing decisions at the earliest opportunity.  

It ought not go without mention that this court extends its thanks to the court staff who manage the increasingly complex scheduling demands, the probation officers, and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority who liaised over victim impact documentation in what are often voluminous and multifaceted files. Their dedication to maintaining order and thoroughness is commendable.  

I further take this occasion to recognise the work of the Manchester Retail Crime Initiative, a partnership enterprise between business owners, police liaison officers, and local authority safeguarding teams. Their continued commitment to sharing intelligence and prompting preventative actions has, on occasion, softened the impact of repeat offending on vulnerable shop staff and proprietors. However, it is a matter of record that the resources expended in assembling the evidential base for cases such as yours, Mr H, are disproportionately high relative to the financial harm caused.  

It would be remiss not to mention the ongoing pressures faced by Greater Manchester Police’s digital investigative unit, tasked with extracting and analysing CCTV footage under increasingly stringent guidelines relating to data privacy and evidentiary robustness. The meticulous cross-referencing of multiple surveillance systems and timeslots consumed approximately 150 staff hours in your case alone. Such resources, though necessary, represent a significant drain on operational capacity for other investigations of arguably higher priority.  

It is against this backdrop that we turn to the substantive legal context and the precise facts of your offending.  

Relevant Legal Framework  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft in terms of dishonesty, appropriation, and intention to permanently deprive. The Crown’s burden has been met in this case beyond reasonable doubt, as reflected in your plea.  

The Sentencing Council guideline on theft offences emphasises the importance of considering the value of goods taken, the scale and frequency of offending, the degree of planning, the use of deceit or intimidation, and any previous convictions. While the monetary value of individual shoplifted items may be modest, cumulative harm—both economic and psychological—is a material consideration.  

It also bears noting that the courts have repeatedly acknowledged the impact of theft offences on victims who may not be financially wealthy but suffer significant distress, loss of confidence, and disruption to their work environment. Such factors were considered in the case of R v. Mulhern [2020] EWCA Crim 1234, where the Court upheld a custodial sentence for repeated theft from a corner shop serving an elderly community despite the modest financial loss involved.  

While the distinctions in harm between offending targeted at large chain stores versus independent local businesses can be nuanced, they are nonetheless relevant. The courts recognise that impact on small businesses, whose margins are often thin and goodwill limited, warrants weight in sentencing consideration. Also pertinent is the precedent established in R v. Roscoe [2018] EWCA Crim 1987, concerning offences involving deception as an aggravating element, although the present case involved no such deceit beyond the concealment inherent in theft itself.  

In setting the compass for sentencing discretion, I bear in mind the guiding principles laid out in R v. Pinnock [2021] EWCA Crim 2103, which reminds that the sentencing judge must strike a balance between punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, public protection, and reparation. The multiplicity of these aims is never easily reconciled; the emphasis varies depending on the offender’s profile, offence severity, and mitigating or aggravating features.  

It is further recognised that sentencing shops theft cases requires sensitivity to the defendant’s personal circumstances, as well as acknowledgment of systemic factors such as poverty, mental health challenges, and the availability of rehabilitative supports. However, these factors do not diminish the core obligation to uphold justice for victims and the wider community.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

The facts as presented outline an extended series of incidents occurring over a period of months, during which you targeted multiple retail environments, ranging from national chain supermarkets to independent pharmacies and convenience outlets. CCTV footage, witness statements, and recovered items formed the evidential basis, supported by your own admissions during interview and your plea today.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

It is worth noting that your conduct featured several distinct phases, involving tactical alterations such as the use of different clothing layers, timed visits to coincide with staff shift changes, and the adoption of distraction techniques in at least four recorded incidents. The operational intelligence report prepared by Manchester Police’s Retail Crime Unit catalogues these behaviours in detail.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

The range of goods taken predominantly comprised personal care products, over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, and small electronic accessories, items identified as having both resale value and demand in grey markets. Your targeting of specific aisles and repeat visits to particular premises points to a degree of planning and calculation rather than opportunistic impulse.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

Several of the affected shop workers provided victim impact statements detailing increased anxiety, disrupted working patterns, and, in some cases, requests for transfers or leave due to the stress induced by your repeated offending. It is accepted that no physical violence or threats were enacted; nonetheless, the psychological impact of persistent theft should not be discounted.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

Prior to the present convictions, you had four prior convictions for theft-related offences, including one dealt with by way of conditional discharge in 2023. There was an earlier community resolution in 2022, which evidently did not achieve the intended deterrent purpose.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

More recently, you were subject to a community order incorporating unpaid work and accredited offender rehabilitation activities. Despite this, the offences before the court post-date the completion of that order and indicate continued engagement in risk-associated behaviour.  

It is germane to mention, in passing, that co-defendant proceedings linked to an unrelated motel burglary in the Greater Manchester district were resolved earlier this year. The individual in question did not appear in connection with your matters, nor is there evidence of association or concerted action. Such distinctions are important to avoid conflated assessments of culpability.

Expert and Support Assessments  
A psychiatric evaluation was commissioned and conducted by Dr Elaine Worthington on 11 September 2025. Her detailed report suggests that you do not fulfil criteria for a formal mental health disorder. However, the report highlights personality traits indicating impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and some underlying anxiety symptoms. Dr Worthington further notes your reported history of recreational cannabis use and past social isolation, albeit with no current substance dependency identified.  

A pre-sentence report by probation officer Mr Samuel Henderson, dated 5 October 2025, corroborates these findings. Mr Henderson describes you as someone who demonstrates sporadic engagement with support services and who generally attributes your behaviour to acute financial hardship and social marginalisation. The report outlines your unstable housing history, marked by temporary council accommodation and at one point, brief periods of sofa surfing with relatives.  

The pre-sentence report stresses that while you show some motivation to desist, the lack of sustained commitment to intervention programs presents an ongoing risk of reoffending. It recommends a community order with a rehabilitative focus, including structured cognitive behavioural therapy, alongside an unpaid work requirement targeting crime reduction aims.  

The probation officer also comments on the chronic underfunding of local authority housing services, which has contributed to overcrowding, increased street homelessness, and the pressure on emergency shelters. While sympathetic to these systemic difficulties, the report underscores the importance of personal responsibility within these constraints.  

On a more tangential note, the report refers to increasing caseloads in the Manchester Probation Service, reflecting national trends highlighted in the Ministry of Justice’s annual report of 2024, which lamented a shortfall of approximately 300 criminal justice social workers nationwide. Such capacity issues undeniably impact the timeliness and intensity of supervision and intervention, often to the detriment of public safety.  

Victim Impact and Community Considerations  
The Retail Crime Initiative provided a collective impact statement from the businesses affected. The cumulative financial losses are estimated at approximately £2,850. Beyond the pecuniary effect, the statement draws attention to the erosion of staff morale and increased absenteeism attributable in part to anxiety and fear of repeat victimisation.  

It is important to note that none of the premises were large supermarkets or department stores but smaller businesses, often family-run, that rely heavily on footfall and regular community engagement. The closure or scaling back of such businesses has a broader deleterious effect on neighbourhood vitality and cohesion.  

Reference may also be made here to a letter from the Greater Manchester Civic Trust, which, though not directly involved, voiced concerns regarding the general normalisation of petty acquisitive crime and its toll on public confidence and urban well-being.  

Other Observations and Procedural Notes  
The court records that throughout proceedings, your defence counsel, Mr Neil Patel, has acted with considerable diligence and professionalism. His submissions have consistently emphasised your personal difficulties, including financial stressors and the challenge of maintaining stable accommodation.  

The Crown, represented by Ms Fiona Clarke, was clear yet measured in her submissions, noting the cumulative seriousness of the offending despite the absence of violence or intimidation.  

It deserves mention that the courtroom in which these proceedings take place was recently refurbished, with enhanced acoustic treatments and upgraded recording systems aimed at improving the clarity of transcripts and speaker audibility. Such procedural improvements, while peripheral to your case, represent ongoing efforts to modernise court infrastructure.  

On a different matter entirely, the court recently presided over a complex cyber fraud trial involving network intrusions targeting local government systems. While unrelated to your offending, it is an example of the breadth of cases contemporary Crown Courts must accommodate, often with constrained resources and overlapping schedules.  

The court was also informed that an adjournment was granted in another Manchester County Court case due to a juror falling ill; in our jurisdiction, jury trials have been largely unaffected to date, but such events underscore the unpredictability inherent in public justice administration.  

It is pertinent to mention that co-defendant Mr A, charged in a different matter with affray involving a pub brawl and assault occasioning bodily harm, was recently sentenced to 24 months’ custody. His unrelated conduct has no bearing here but serves as an indicator of the range of offences processed by local courts.  

While your personal history includes no reports of violence or public disorder, the court is conscious that cohabitants in your building or nearby residents have been the subject of noise abatement notices on occasion. Such matters, while extraneous to the charges here, contribute, cumulatively, to the social environment in which clients such as yourself reside and must be borne in mind during rehabilitation efforts.  

Closing Submissions and Sentencing Intentions  
In conclusion, this case presents a regrettably familiar profile: repeated shop theft by an individual ensnared in challenging socioeconomic circumstances, with a pattern of relapse despite prior interventions. The court is ever mindful of the balance between the need for deterrence and the potential for rehabilitation.  

It must be recorded that your guilty plea, albeit entered after initial denial and delay, is accepted as a factor for credit, though the timing justifiably tempers the extent of reduction. The late admission has necessarily entailed additional public and procedural costs, including the preparation of witness statements, disclosure bundles, and adjournments.  

The framework established by the Sentencing Council for theft offences contemplates a tiered approach, reflecting both the value of goods taken and the offender’s culpability profile. The aggravating features of persistence, targeting vulnerable businesses, and impact on staff weigh heavily. Mitigating factors include your early engagement with psychiatric and probation services, expression of remorse during the plea process, and acknowledgement of some personal difficulties.  

The court is inclined to seek a custodial sentence of a determinate nature measured against the totality principle but is willing to consider community-based orders provided there is evidence of sincere engagement and a credible prospect of rehabilitation. The pre-sentence report will be pivotal in informing this determination.  

These sentencing remarks and observations are issued this day, 15 October 2025, in Court 6 at Manchester Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal judgment and sentencing order will be promulgated subsequent to consideration of the probation report and any further representations from parties.  

You are reminded of your right to appeal against sentence or conviction within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are currently engaged. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
