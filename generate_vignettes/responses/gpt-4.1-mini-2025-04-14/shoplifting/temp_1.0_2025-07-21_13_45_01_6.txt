IN THE CROWN COURT AT WOLVERHAMPTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. W2025/13467  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. R. Kilburn  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this Court for sentence upon your adjudication of guilt in respect of offences contrary to the Theft Act 1968, namely shoplifting from multiple retail premises over an extended period. The charges reflect a pattern of offences occurring principally in the metropolitan area of Wolverhampton and surrounding suburbs, spanning an estimated duration from mid-2023 to the early months of 2025.  

Procedural History  
Your initial arrest occurred on 10 April 2025, following an inquiry prompted by reports from a collective of retail outlets coordinated under the West Midlands Retail Crime Partnership. The lead investigation was conducted by officers of Wolverhampton Local Policing Unit alongside Store Protection Officers assigned to the partnership. This multi-agency nexus has, over recent years, been increasingly relied upon to gather, collate and disseminate intelligence regarding patterns of acquisitive offending within the region, seeking to identify repeat or organised offenders through careful cross-referencing of incident reports, witness accounts, and surveillance footage.  

It is worth noting that the establishment of the West Midlands Retail Crime Partnership on 1 June 2017, coinciding with the national drive towards better multi-agency risk management frameworks, brought with it aspirations to reduce repeat theft by enhanced information sharing and tactical coordination. This model, while ambitious and well-intentioned, has encountered substantial operational challenges, chiefly linked to the limitations imposed by varying resource availability among partner organisations and the fluctuating cooperation of retail businesses themselves — some of whom prefer informal resolution of incidents to avoid reputational damage and customer alarm.  

Your arrest came after the deployment of sophisticated investigatory tactics, including but not limited to the analysis of CCTV systems across several major supermarket chains and independent retailers. The Greater West Midlands Digital Forensics Unit provided technical assistance in mapping your movements and behaviour over a period of several weeks, utilising both fixed surveillance and the retrospective examination of transaction data. The process required judicial authority to access mobile network data for triangulation purposes, which was granted by a District Judge on 25 March 2025 following a considered application by the Inquiry Lead. This judicial oversight underscores the gravity with which the prosecuting authorities approached your alleged conduct.  

Amid the procedural progress, it should be observed that the Court has encountered recent systemic difficulties with timely provision of Legal Aid funding in matters involving forensic expert instructions. In your case, the defence's application for a psychiatric evaluation under Legal Aid was subject to multiple rounds of requests for clarification and documentation, finally authorised only on 12 August 2025. Such delays are of considerable concern and place strain upon the prompt administration of justice. That modern Legal Aid arrangements often manifest this kind of procedural inertia has been lamented in successive judicial comments and official reviews, including the 2023 Parliamentary Justice Committee report on "Legal Aid Funding Barriers to Fair Trial." Here, as elsewhere, the defence has borne the consequences of inadequate systemic responsiveness.  

Following your initial not guilty plea entered at the first hearing on 6 May 2025, subsequent disclosure of cumulative evidential material—including detailed footages and contemporaneous store staff statements—precipitated a change to a guilty plea on 8 September 2025, coinciding with the Penalty Hearing. Credit for your plea will be addressed further within the sentencing determination.

During the period between your first remand and present appearance, the Court received several submissions from community organisations active within Wolverhampton and adjacent areas. Notable among these was a letter from the Wolverhampton Community Support Network, a voluntary organisation assisting vulnerable adults experiencing cycles of deprivation and social exclusion. Their correspondence acknowledged the wider social concerns implicated in cases of persistent shoplifting but refrained from advocating leniency, instead focusing on systemic factors contributing to offending behaviour, such as chronic unemployment, housing instability, and mental health challenges. Similar representations were made by Wolverhampton Womens’ Aid, albeit indirectly via a supporting statement from a family member, speaking to the defendant’s background and personal challenges.  

Paralleling these community inputs, the Court also received comprehensive reports from the Probation Service, accentuating the need to view your offending in the context of known criminogenic factors and potential areas for rehabilitative engagement. Particular attention was given to prior contact with services and the apparent absence of sustained support interventions, a circumstance this Court notes with some disquiet. The report, authored by Senior Probation Officer Ms Leanne Rutherford, is appended to this file and forms a critical component of the current sentencing deliberations.  

The case management process was initially scheduled to conclude with sentencing on 15 September 2025, subsequent to the receipt of a pre-sentence report and the psychiatric evaluation commissioned by the defence. Both reports are now before the Court.

Legal Context and Case Law  
The statutory framework under which you are sentenced derives principally from the Theft Act 1968, section 1, defining theft as "dishonestly appropriating property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it." Applicable sentencing guidance is found in the Theft offence guideline published by the Sentencing Council, which emphasises the necessity of assessing total value appropriated, offending frequency, use of sophistication or planning, and impact upon victims.  

This Court draws upon a number of precedents that, while not identical in circumstances, illustrate the judiciary's approach to repeated acquisitive crime. In R v. Jenkins [2019] EWCA Crim 1543, the appellant’s persistent shoplifting of low-value items from multiple retail premises resulted in a custodial sentence, emphasising deterrence and the demonstrable impact on community confidence. Jenkins demonstrates the importance placed upon the cumulative effect of repeated low-level offending, notwithstanding individual offences’ modest financial value.  

Similarly, R v. Prescott [2022] EWCA Crim 1977 concerned thefts from multiple supermarket chains where the defendant exploited staff shortages and peak trading hours to conduct repeated offences. The Court of Appeal endorsed a sentence of 12 months, stressing that the offender’s tactics elevated the seriousness and impact beyond mere monetary loss, highlighting the emotional distress and diminished sense of safety among retail employees.  

It is pertinent to mention, in passing, the case of R v. McGlashan [2018] EWCA Crim 911, focussed on aggravated burglary and weapon possession, where despite the gravity of the underlying offences, the court suspended sentence upon detailed consideration of the defendant’s background and rehabilitative prospects. While McGlashan’s facts lie outside the present shoplifting context, the principles of proportionality and consideration of mitigating factors remain instructive.  

The offences before this Court fall into a category frequently described in the judiciary as “persistent acquisitive offending.” Such cases present complex sentencing challenges, balancing the need for punishment, deterrence, and community protection against rehabilitation and the possibility of underlying vulnerabilities.    

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

It is well established that credit for a guilty plea is discretionary and reflects not only the timing but also the genuineness of remorse and the saving of prosecutorial and court resources. R v. Collingwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1389 neatly summarises the principles: early pleas, made prior to evidence compilation, warrant enhanced discount; last-minute admissions after exhaustive investigations attract lesser credit.  

In your case, the plea was entered at a relatively late stage, after extensive evidence was gathered and several pre-trial hearings concluded, thus limiting available mitigation on that basis.  

Expert and Psychiatric Reports  
The defence instructed a psychiatric evaluation, conducted by Dr Verena Schmidt, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose detailed report was submitted on 7 September 2025. Dr Schmidt notes an absence of severe or enduring mental disorder, though she records mild elevation in anxiety scores and indications of depressive symptoms related to socioeconomic stressors. The report also refers to traits suggestive of impulsivity and executive dysfunction, but stressed that no formal diagnosis meeting DSM-V criteria for a major psychiatric condition was evident.  

Dr Schmidt’s opinion cautiously advances that your behaviour is “impulsively driven,” shaped by adverse environmental factors and potential unmet therapeutic needs. However, she also emphasizes limited cooperation during her consultations and notes that the defendant declined offers of community mental health follow-up, which limits the ability to formulate a robust management plan. The report recommends consideration be given to structured probationary supervision incorporating cognitive behavioural modalities.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

It is salutary to recall that while psychiatric input is valuable and may provide necessary context, it neither diminishes responsibility nor forecloses custodial sentencing where warranted. As established in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the presence of psychiatric vulnerability does not of itself exempt an offender from the consequences of demonstrably deliberate wrongdoing. Mallory concerned a defendant diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder who had been convicted of multiple arson offences — a context markedly different from yours, yet the principle that treatment and containment must be balanced in sentencing remains germane.  

Agency Correspondence and Victim Impact  
Letters received from the Wolverhampton Retail Support Alliance outline the material losses, staff anxiety, and reputational damage experienced by affected shops, none of which was insignificant. The Alliance lamented the increasing reluctance among smaller independent retailers to report incidents, citing fears of negative publicity and customer alienation. Unfortunately, this reluctance contributes to underreporting and hampers broader crime reduction efforts.  

Similarly, South Wolverhampton Safer Homes Network provided a briefing note referencing recent increases in petty theft and antisocial behaviour linked to economic hardship and housing precarity. This trenchant observation reiterates the challenges faced by public bodies in addressing seemingly minor offences that cumulatively degrade community wellbeing.  

It was also brought to the Court’s attention that an unrelated co-defendant involved in a separate matter pending before this jurisdiction was charged with failing to appear at trial and is currently at large. This defendant is not connected to you in any way, and the Court makes no findings regarding that case. However, the reference is noted as an example of procedural challenges facing criminal justice bodies.

Facts of the Offending  
The core of the prosecution case is made up of multiple instances captured on security footage and corroborating witness statements. You are observed entering at least four different retail premises over the months indicated, concealing diverse items ranging from toiletries to confectionery and consumables.  

Modus operandi included use of casual clothing layers to mask items, selection of busy periods to minimise staff attention, and in one instance, the purported removal of security tags from packaged goods — a practice that evidences inappropriate preparation and intention beyond momentary opportunism.  

Several employees testified to anxiety and unease at your repeated presence, with some rearranging stock positioning or adjusting work schedules as precautionary measures. While your conduct did not escalate to violence or threats, the psychological impact on retail staff, especially those working alone or in vulnerable roles, was palpable.  

You have a prior history of acquisitive offending, including convictions for similar offences in 2020 and 2022, as well as a conditional caution issued in late 2023. Despite diversion attempts, your offending persisted, indicating a pattern requiring meaningful intervention.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

It is noted that the value of goods appropriated per individual offence was typically under £30, but that the aggregate loss across all incidents, when including loss prevention and operational disruptions, is substantial. The Court is satisfied that your actions, taken cumulatively, demonstrate intent, planning, and knowledge of likely consequences.  

Your conduct also resulted in increased workload pressures for store management and security staff, with documented rota changes and additional training sessions conducted in response to your activities. The indirect economic impact, while less readily quantifiable, is nevertheless significant and cannot be disregarded.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Defence submissions emphasise your personal difficulties, including periods of homelessness and unemployment, and your expressed desire to break the cycle of offending. While these factors may mitigate to some extent, they do not absolve culpability. The Court is fortified in this view by the comprehensive report provided by Ms Rutherford, who highlights your inconsistent engagement with support services and consequent risk of reoffending absent structured supervision.  

It is regrettable—to put it mildly—that opportunities for early diversion were not fully leveraged, though it must be acknowledged that resource constraints within probation and local mental health services remain painfully evident. Waiting lists for Adult Mental Health Services in the Wolverhampton area are currently exceeding twelve weeks, a situation which reflects national trends documented in the NHS England Quarterly Mental Health Statistics Report, Q1 2025.  

Despite these systemic pressures, the Court expects individuals who seek assistance to engage promptly and meaningfully; failure to do so undermines the prospect of rehabilitation.

Sentencing Considerations  
Mr H, your offending is serious by virtue of repetition, planning, and impact on the victims who have been harmed economically and psychologically. While your guilty plea is noted, its late timing limits the credit rightly afforded under R v. Collingwood.  

Custodial sentencing for persistent acquisitive offenders is
