IN THE CROWN COURT AT EASTGATE  
R v MR H  
Case No. T2025/13479  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. C. WIMBLETON  
Filed: 18 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand today before this Honourable Court for sentence following your conviction for shoplifting, an offence prosecuted under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge represents a culmination of a protracted period of intentional dishonesty directed against a number of retail establishments within and around the Eastgate metropolitan area between the months of October 2023 and April 2025. This court has considered at length the procedural background and detailed evidence associated with your offending, including submissions from both the Crown and your defence team, as well as expert assessments furnished in preparation for the disposition of your case.  

Before detailing the specific factual matrix, it is prudent to situate this matter within its wider procedural and institutional context so as to fully appreciate the numerous layers of administrative, evidential, and legal complexity that have attended its progression to date. You were initially arrested on 15 May 2025 by officers of the Eastgate Metropolitan Police Service following intelligence-sharing between retail loss prevention officers and the Local Business Crime Reduction Partnership, a multi-agency initiative aimed at addressing persistent low-level acquisitive offences, particularly those impacting small, independent retailers whose operations remain acutely vulnerable to economic disruption. The investigation was notable for its cross-sector collaboration, incorporating data provided by several stores, CCTV footage analysis, and the involvement of dedicated crime analysts within the Property Crime Unit.  

As has been observed in many similar circumstances, the assembly of an evidential case in offences of this nature frequently entails considerable time and resource investment disproportionate to the apparent gravity of each individual theft. The often-fragmented nature of evidence in retail theft, the multiplicity of premises involved, and the necessity of reconciling disparate eyewitness accounts require painstaking effort by law enforcement and prosecution teams alike. This operational challenge is compounded by the increasingly congested caseload burdens carried by Crown Court listing units, exacerbated further by intermittent judicial strike action and staffing shortages within court administrative bodies.  

It is with some emphasis I note the evident commitment of the Eastgate Business Crime Reduction Partnership in this instance, which, despite systemic pressures, fulfilled its role with commendable diligence. The partnership was able to compile a composite offender profile, facilitating your identification and eventual apprehension. This outcome represents a modest operational success within a context that, regrettably, all too often reflects bureaucratic inertia and under-resourcing.  

Defence counsel’s earlier application for adjournment to secure psychiatric expertise was granted on 3 July 2025, reflecting the court’s engagement with contemporary imperatives to identify and address any underlying mental health issues that might bear upon sentencing disposition. The psychiatric report authored by Dr Farah Mistry, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, was received on 22 September 2025 and extensively considered. Dr Mistry’s evaluation, though detailed, concluded the absence of any major psychiatric disorder but highlighted tendencies towards impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. These features, while relevant to tailored rehabilitative strategies, cannot detract from your accountability for deliberate unlawful conduct.  

In addition, a comprehensive pre-sentence report from the Eastgate Probation Service was submitted on 11 October 2025. The report highlights a precarious accommodation status, intermittent employment history, and minimal engagement with support services, notably those addressing substance misuse and financial hardship. It further records prior police encounters and your mixed responses to community liaison efforts. The probation officer noted “missed appointments and intermittent attendance at voluntary support programmes,” underscoring a pattern of inconsistent engagement that complicates the risk management approach.  

Though such contextual matters are not without significance, the court is cognizant that support offered but declined does not mitigate culpability nor diminish the requirement for a sentencing outcome that serves both public protection and deterrence. The availability of community resources—though stretched—remains a crucial pillar of rehabilitative justice; their rejection raises challenging questions regarding the realistic prospects for future desistance without enforced intervention.  

In earlier case management hearings, the Crown conceded that while the offences are serious in pattern and impact, there are no overt aggravating features of violence or threat to persons, nor any evidence of organised retail crime or gang association. The defendant, by contrast, characterised the offending as isolated episodes borne from acute financial necessity and described a willingness, albeit disjointed, to engage with social welfare providers moving forward. These representations, while noted, sit uneasily against the consistent narrative of repeated offending and prior warnings.  

I turn now to some observations of a more general, if no less pertinent, nature. The court has a well-established practice of acknowledging the broader social and institutional milieu in which offences of this kind arise and are adjudicated. We live in times marked by significant socio-economic strain, with increased street homelessness, austerity-driven service retrenchment, and a fracturing of communal reciprocal bonds. Public order is tested not merely by flagrant lawbreaking but by the quieter erosion of mutual regard that once underpinned neighbourhood cohesion. It is often said—and with some justification—that acquisitive crimes such as shoplifting serve as canaries in the coal mine, revealing gaps in welfare provision and cracks in social solidarity. However cogent those diagnoses may be, they do not absolve individuals from responsibility for their actions. The criminal justice system must navigate these tensions with care but also with clarity.  

It bears recalling, for example, the guidance found in the Sentencing Council’s Theft and Handling guideline (2021), which underscores the necessity of proportionate sentencing that reflects both the culpability and harm. The guideline advocates differentiation according to the sophistication of the offending pattern, use or threat of violence, and the vulnerability of victims, among other factors. Custodial sentences remain available where community orders would be insufficient to mark the seriousness of the case or to protect the public interest.  

The court invited detailed written submissions from legal counsel concerning the applicability of relevant appellate authorities. The defence notably drew attention to R v. Coleman [2023] EWCA Crim 588, where the Court of Appeal reduced a custodial sentence for a repeat shoplifter suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, emphasising therapeutic possibilities and the need to avoid unnecessary institutionalisation. While the diagnosis in Coleman offers an instructive lens on vulnerability-informed sentencing, the present matter does not share its clinical profile and thus the decision carries limited persuasiveness here.  

By contrast, the Crown relied upon R v. Stratford [2022] EWCA Crim 1047, which upheld immediate custody for repeated theft from pharmacy premises, highlighting the disruption and fear caused to staff who often performed alone in quiet or high-risk areas. The circumstances of Stratford resonate more closely with the present facts, underscoring the relevance of the defendant’s impact upon frontline workers and the wider commercial community.  

One must, however, be mindful that the principle of parity commands that like offences against like offenders receive like treatment, barring exceptional features. This court must, therefore, strike a balance between the aggravating and mitigating factors present, calibrated to the individual circumstances of Mr H.  

There are however, procedural observations of note which merit explicit mention. The case has experienced some unavoidable listing delays caused by the concurrent digitalisation project in Eastgate Crown Court, which has led to intermittent system outages and necessitated manual transcription in certain instances. While no ultimate prejudice to either party has emerged, such operational matters contribute to incremental inefficiencies in criminal justice administration.  

Additionally, the recent enhanced security protocols in the court building—prompted by a separate major fraud trial—occasionally affected witness waiting times and scheduling but did not materially disrupt proceedings. The court staff and ushers have once again demonstrated commendable professionalism in managing these challenges.  

The case also attracted local media interest owing to an unrelated investigation involving a co-defendant in a wholly separate matter of public order offences arising from a protest outside City Square. That co-defendant was charged with affray and possession of a bladed article, offences that in no way reflect upon Mr H’s conduct or character. It is a reminder that criminal circumstances can be entangled, yet it is imperative to maintain strict delineation between distinct allegations.  

Let me address, too, the issue of Lawful Aid provision in this matter. There has been persistent and frustrating delay in securing prompt authorisation for expert instruction, notably the psychiatric evaluation earlier referenced. The Legal Aid Agency’s protracted administrative processes, marked by multiple requests for clarification and protracted funding decisions, served only to exacerbate the time to resolution. This court records its regret at the strain such bureaucratic impediments place upon defendants, advocates, and the institution of justice itself. Indeed, these issues remain a systemic concern meriting urgent review.  

Turning finally to the facts of your offending, Mr H, the court notes the following:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

Your pattern of conduct was marked by deliberate concealment of merchandise, often employing distraction techniques such as engaging staff in feigned conversation or deliberately tampering with packaging. Your movements were repeatedly captured on store CCTV showing consistent targeting of convenience stores’ aisles devoted to personal care products and over-the-counter pharmaceutical items—goods typically in ready demand in black market resale or personal consumption.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

This persistence, frequency, and degree of cunning are significant aggravating factors. The court also acknowledges the submissions made on your behalf regarding your unsettled accommodation status and broader social vulnerabilities. Such contextual matters are relevant for tailoring rehabilitative opportunities but are insufficient to outweigh the objective gravity and culpability evident in your offences.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

Despite prior interventions—both formal and informal—you resumed offending behaviour within months, highlighting a propensity to disregard previous warnings and community resolutions. This reality informs the court’s approach to sentencing severity.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

Victim impact statements submitted by staff at affected stores detail a palpable increase in anxiety and workplace stress attributable to your repeated appearances, with some employees soliciting adjustments to working patterns or shifts to avoid lone working. No evidence of physical violence or threats is recorded but the psychological toll cannot be discounted.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

The Crown further asserts, and I accept, that your previous convictions include multiple prior theft offences spanning nearly five years, reflecting a well-established pattern of acquisitive offending.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

While no current allegations of gang association or co-criminality with other offenders attach to you, the repetition of conduct despite prior legal consequences and informal resolutions suggests an ingrained criminal habit warranting a proportionate and deterrent sentence.  

In assessing appropriate sentencing, this court is mindful of the importance of rehabilitative sentencing options where feasible, particularly those that might address impulsivity and financial instability. The probation report emphasizes the potential utility of enrolling you in a “Problem-Solving Court” pilot initiative recently launched in Eastgate, focusing on repeat acquisitive offenders with social vulnerabilities. Such an intervention could blend judicial supervision with tailored social support and cognitive skills development.  

However, the baseline for any community order remains compliance and recognition of harm. The court reserves judgment as to the suitability of such a measure pending final pre-sentence evaluation of your amenability to structured programmes, risk assessment outcomes, and further submissions from probation services and defence counsel.  

In conclusion, I emphasise that shoplifting—even at lower monetary values—has implications beyond mere financial loss. It disrupts legitimate business operations, threatens employee welfare, and erodes public confidence in community safety. Persistent offending magnifies these harms and thus demands a consequential response from the sentencing court.  

I shall accordingly adjourn sentencing to enable receipt of an updated probation report incorporating the latest risk assessment and programme availability. The sentence imposed will seek to balance the objectives of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public in accordance with established sentencing principles.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 October 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Eastgate. Proceedings have been transcribed and are recorded in compliance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. A transcript will be maintained in the formal court record. You are reminded of your statutory right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Unless otherwise specified, no reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Matters concerning costs remain reserved until further review.  

These are the orders of the court.
