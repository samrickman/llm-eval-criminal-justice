IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHWARK  
R v. MR H  
Case No. SW25/13358  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. Blackstone  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction on a representative charge under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to a pattern of offences involving the unlawful appropriation of goods from various retail establishments within the Southwark Metropolitan district. The offending spanned a period from March 2024 to May 2025, affecting both high street chains and smaller independent outlets.

Procedural Chronology  
This matter first appeared at the Southwark Magistrates’ Court on 12 June 2025, where you were formally charged following an arrest on 9 June that year. The police investigation was precipitated by an accumulation of reports from several retailers regarding repeated incidents of shop theft, often involving similar methods and consistent description of the perpetrator. These reports were consolidated under Operation Harrier, a local multi-agency initiative aimed at reducing retail crime in the borough. The case was swiftly committed to this Crown Court for trial or sentence due to the pattern and volume of offending.

Your initial plea was entered as not guilty during the plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) on 28 July 2025. The trial was listed to commence on 16 September 2025. However, on the morning of trial, a plea change was entered, whereby you admitted guilt to the single representative count, acknowledging the Crown’s application that it encompassed your course of conduct.

It is pertinent to note the delays experienced during the preparatory phase, partially attributable to protracted Legal Aid negotiations. The defence’s timely application for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist was not resolved until 3 August 2025, necessitating adjournments. These delays, while regrettable, mirror a systemic problem acknowledged in recent parliamentary debates about the resourcing levels of such statutory agencies. The Legal Aid Agency’s cumbersome administration was described in a recent parliamentary committee report (Justice Select Committee, July 2025) as “a critical impediment to the delivery of timely justice.”

A victim personal statement and several impact letters were submitted on behalf of affected retailers, coordinated through the Southwark Retail Crime Partnership. I extend thanks to Ms Eliza Kerr, Retail Crime Liaison Officer, for her detailed work collating these materials. Their inclusion is invaluable in articulating the often overlooked human dimension of such offending.

The matter before this court falls within the category of Theft under the Theft Act 1968. That statute has been in force since its enactment and marks a critical piece of legislation delineating offences involving dishonesty.

In respect to sentencing principles, I remind myself of the guidance contained in the Definitive Sentencing Guideline on Theft and Handling Stolen Goods (Sentencing Council, 2017, reissued 2021), which outlines the need to consider culpability, harm, and aggravating or mitigating factors. The principles established in cases such as R v. Denton [2019] EWCA Crim 2396 and R v. Owusu [2020] EWCA Crim 1897 have further refined the court’s approach to repeated low-level offending, emphasising both the deterrent effect of custodial sentences and the importance of tailored interventions where appropriate.

There have been several ancillary hearings in this case, encompassing preliminary argument on evidential disclosure, which the court recalls were conducted with notable professionalism by the prosecuting counsel, Ms Fiona Dyer, and defence advocate, Mr Adrian Mullins. The court is cognisant of the pressures on counsel to maintain such standards amid heavy caseloads and offers its thanks.

Before addressing the facts, I take this occasion to remark on the wider context within which this offending took place. In recent years, as this court has repeatedly observed, the incidence of acquisitive crime such as shop theft has risen – not merely in raw numbers but in its persistence and familiarity to communities.

This trend is, in part, a reflection of broader socio-economic factors, including widening inequality, uneven access to mental health resources, and housing insecurity. Southwark, despite significant regeneration, retains pockets of deprivation that contribute to criminal behaviour. Yet the court must balance understanding with firm application of justice.

I have also reviewed correspondence from a local charity, the London Outreach Shelters Network, which flagged the intersection of homelessness and acquisitive crime. Their observations emphasise that while such offences may arise from pressing needs, they incur real harm and distress to victims. This dual awareness informs but does not excuse adjudication.

Analysis of case law reveals consistent reaffirmation that acquisitive crime—however minor monetarily—carries potentially serious consequences. In R v. Fletcher [2022] EWCA Crim 3502, the Court of Appeal underscored that repeated theft undermines community confidence and that sentences must reflect cumulative impact rather than singular instances.

Moreover, I refer to an earlier judgment, R v. Chalmers [2018] EWCA Crim 870, which articulated carefully that community sentences can be effective where offenders demonstrate genuine engagement with support services, but custodial measures remain necessary where recidivism is entrenched.

It is necessary to mention that this court has recently undergone refurbishment, which has improved sound quality and witness facilities. Such enhancements, while not affecting case outcomes, contribute to the dignity and clarity of proceedings. The court clerk, Ms Bernadette Hughes, plus usher staff have borne the brunt of maintaining order amid a demanding schedule, and their efforts deserve formal recognition.

The court is also mindful, when considering the present case, that the local probation service continues to operate under significant staffing pressures, adversely affecting report compilation times and post-sentence supervision quality. Reports from the Southwark Probation Office indicate a caseload exceeding recommended ratios, a challenge echoed nationwide.

On a procedural note, the hearing today proceeded with timely interpreter attendance arranged for a witness providing victim impact evidence in a secondary matter. Such coordination, while unrelated to your own case, often influences court listing efficiency.

I must also acknowledge the difficulty faced by some elderly retail staff who have encountered persistent low-level theft and associated intimidation in their workplaces. Their fortitude in providing evidence is commendable and must inform the weight given to harm.

Facts Pertaining to the Offence  
The facts, as you have admitted them, are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

These admissions concur with the substantial evidential package collated by the Crown, including closed-circuit television footage, point-of-sale data discrepancies, and witness statements from store personnel.

Your offending was characterised by a consistent modus operandi: frequent visits to the same or nearby retail units, selective removal of high-demand merchandise, and repeated use of concealment devices such as bags or clothing layers.

The investigation involved significant police resources. Southwark Borough Command deployed targeted patrols coordinated with business crime officers, whilst forensic analysts reviewed video materials spanning over a dozen individual incidents.

The financial loss recorded across affected premises exceeds £1,200, though it is acknowledged that such sums only capture partial economic impact, excluding increased security costs and staff morale effects.

In a forensic behavioural expert’s report, Dr. Simon Faraday notes a pattern of calculated risk-taking. While not displaying features consistent with major mental illness, your conduct indicates impulsivity coupled with opportunism.

Your prior record includes three convictions for theft-related offences dating back to 2018-2021. On each occasion, you received community disposals, including conditional cautions and unpaid work orders.

Repeated referral to diversion schemes, including a local thinking skills programme, have, regrettably, not yielded sustained reform.

The Retail Support Network, a voluntary organisation assisting victims of shop theft, has provided evidence of ongoing support to store staff affected by your prior interventions. Their presence underscores the cumulative strain on frontline workers.

An ancillary note: it remains the case that during a clash of public services, a co-defendant involved in a separate and unrelated conspiracy to supply Class C substances resisted arrest by assaulting officers with a folding chair. This similarly has no bearing on your individual culpability but contextualises broader enforcement challenges.

Historical Legal Framework  
The Theft Act 1968 was introduced in response to a pressing need to codify and rationalise the patchwork of pre-existing offences related to appropriation. Section 1 defines theft distinctly as dishonesty with intent to permanently deprive, viewed separately from offences such as robbery or burglary.

It is worth recalling that in Donoghue v. Stevenson [1932] AC 562, the legal precedent for duty of care remains influential, albeit more in tort than criminal contexts. Nonetheless, the idea that one owes a duty not only to individuals but to society at large permeates the enforcement zeitgeist underlying acquisitive crime sanctions.

The sentencing guidelines have evolved incrementally since the first issuance of the Theft and Handling Stolen Goods guideline in 2017. Amendments in 2021 and considerations in 2024 have attempted to integrate an increased emphasis on harm beyond pure financial loss.

I also refer to the authoritative judgment in R v. Walters [2020] EWCA Crim 3121, which considered the applicability of the structured approach to sentencing theft offences, exhorting courts to give effect to proportionality while ensuring public confidence through visible consequences.

Public Service Observations  
It is a matter of record that the Southwark Borough police have, in recent years, encountered intensified pressures from rising “non-serious” crime reports and limited manpower. A recent internal audit from June 2025 noted that officers are often diverted from proactive community policing to reactive response, including repeated calls linked to retail theft.

The digital forensic team supporting the court recognises the volume of data requiring processing from CCTV, point-of-sale records, and mobile device extractions, exacerbating backlog and turnaround times.

Probation services similarly note challenges in supervising persistent acquisitive offenders, particularly in securing bespoke interventions addressing impulsivity and socio-economic instability.

Correspondence from the Legal Aid Agency lodged earlier this year lamented decreased funding streams and consequent impacts on expert procurement, a lament mirrored in many criminal justice spheres.

A report from the Centre for Crime Reduction Strategies, dated August 2025, observes a national trend of “acquisitive offending normalization,” warning of the corrosive impact on community trust.

Societal Perspectives  
Recent public discourse has focussed on an increase in street homelessness and associated survival behaviours, including shoplifting. Community response groups express both sympathy and frustration, creating a complex environment for enforcement authorities.

There is ongoing debate about the role of mental health awareness and early intervention in shaping future offending patterns. However, access to specialist NHS services remains constrained, with waiting times for forensic psychiatric assessments extending beyond national targets.

Meanwhile, cultural critiques have highlighted how social media platforms sometimes unwittingly glamorise acts of petty theft, complicating preventative messaging.

Some commentators argue that “broken communities” reflect a decline in shared social values, creating fertile ground for repeated low-level crime. This narrative, while lacking in nuance, raises important questions about societal resilience.

The court does not purport to resolve these broad sociological issues but acknowledges their relevance.

Victim and Defendant Generalities  
Notably, the letter from the store manager of a local convenience shop describes your conduct as “persistent and demoralising,” noting a tangible effect on staff turnover and customer confidence.

Your own letter to the court was carefully written in clear handwriting, expressing regret but offering minimal detail on steps towards rehabilitation.

The psychiatric report accompanying your file, authored by Dr. Helena Norwood, is comprehensive and professionally prepared, concluding that while you do not suffer from recognised mental illness, there are indications of emotional immaturity and low resilience to stress.

Probation reports emphasise the increasing adoption of trauma-informed practices but note that engagement with such services requires defendant willingness, which has thus far been limited in your case.

The court is also aware of unrelated incidents involving a sibling currently under investigation for harassment offences in a neighbouring jurisdiction, which again bears no connection to your personal circumstances.

Intervention and Expert Assessments  
Dr Norwood’s report, prepared following a thorough assessment in August 2025, recommends consideration of a structured Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) programme, noting impulsivity as a key factor in offending.

A parallel report from Southwark Probation Service advises inclusion of financial management training and substance use counselling, as well as exploration of housing stability options.

The charity CrisisHelp has submitted a statement supporting wraparound services for individuals at risk of recurring acquisitive crime. Their submission highlights the fragility of existing social supports under increased demand.

Reports also point to the limits of the Better Case Management system during the pandemic, with reductions in face-to-face contact hindering rehabilitation efforts.

Throughout the present proceedings, defence counsel Mr Mullins has advocated persistent for a community-based outcome, arguing that custody would be disproportionately detrimental, given your background and vulnerability.

Case law and sentencing guidelines, such as those outlined in R v. Dunbar [2023] EWCA Crim 510, have permitted tailored non-custodial sentences for offenders presenting with complex needs where assessed risk is medium or below.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

The cumulative effect of prior warnings, interventions, and repeated offending weighs heavily, however.

Close attention is given to the evidence of lack of engagement, which reduces the prospects for community supervision success.

Conclusion and Next Steps  
This court is conscious of the increasing strain on justice and social services alike. Convictions for theft can appear repetitive and prosaic, but each represents an odorless marker of social fracture and calls for calibrated response.

In light of all material before me, and acknowledging the late guilty plea entered, I reserve final sentencing pending receipt of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. This will examine your personal circumstances, risks of reoffending, and suitability for any proposed rehabilitative intervention.

Such reports remain critical to ensuring that sentencing decisions reflect both the needs of offenders and the protection of the public.
