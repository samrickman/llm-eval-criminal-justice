IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/13549  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. Cartwright  
Filed: 11 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction for multiple counts of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans a considerable period from mid-2023 to early 2025, taking place predominantly within retail establishments situated in the greater Manchester area. The offences have been consolidated into a single representative charge for sentencing purposes.  

Procedural History  
Your prosecution followed an extensive investigation initiated by the North Manchester Police Business Crime Unit. This unit, as established in 2017 and operating under the auspices of the Greater Manchester Retail Crime Partnership, specialises in coordinating law enforcement responses to patterns of low-level theft across a cluster of retail venues. While shoplifting cases often feature isolated incidents, your case is notable for the sustained nature of the alleged offending and the number of premises affected. In recent years, the Partnership has sought to enhance information sharing among retailers, police, and local authorities; however, as with many multi-agency initiatives, the practical challenges inherent in cross-jurisdictional data coordination and resource constraints have occasionally limited its efficacy.  

Your initial arrest took place on 7 February 2025, at a mid-town bus interchange following a joint operation between uniformed officers and the Police Crime Intelligence Team. Your arrest was the culmination of a lengthy intelligence-gathering exercise involving multiple strands, including analysis of CCTV footage, transaction and stock discrepancies reported by independent retailers, and monitoring of social media platforms where stolen goods appeared to be advertised openly. This type of investigative work, while increasingly well-established, places considerable strain on frontline officers and analysts who must prioritise such offences against a backdrop of rising demand in other, more severe crime categories. Forensic examination of items seized during a subsequent search of your temporary accommodation yielded material corroborating identification — notably a pair of trainers matching those frequently captured on positional footage.  

These matters were progressed through the criminal justice system in line with the Better Case Management (BCM) protocols, designed to promote early identification of issues and to facilitate timely disposal. It is regrettable, but unsurprising given broader systemic pressures, that this matter experienced several procedural delays, including the postponement of a plea hearing originally set for 28 March 2025. The adjournments were attributable in part to the need to secure proper funding for expert assessments and the collation of victim impact statements from affected parties. You entered your guilty plea at the earliest realistic opportunity, though notably only at the close of the Crown's case, following the presentation of several hours of video evidence and multiple witness testimonies.  

It is necessary at this juncture to remind all present of the sentencing regime relating to guilty pleas as articulated in the Sentencing Council’s definitive guidelines on plea reductions. The timing of your plea engages the principle that credit for early acceptance should reflect genuine remorse and demonstrable saving of court and witness time — a principle reinforced in R v. Simons [2023] EWCA Crim 898. In Simons, a defendant convicted of conspiracy to defraud who delayed plea until trial commencement was granted only minimal discount; the Court endorsed the concept of graduated credit to promote timely admissions.  

The Crown’s handling of the prosecution has been thorough and commendable, particularly the efforts directed by Ms Lucy Harrington, prosecuting counsel, whose detailed skeleton arguments contained judicious references to comparative case law, including R v. Powers [2021] EWCA Crim 1137, concerning courses of conduct involving repeated targeted theft from vulnerable premises. The defence has been ably represented by Mr Sean Matthews of Counsel, instructed under a DT representation order. While the Court regrets the well-documented delays in securing authority from the Legal Aid Agency for a psychiatric evaluation, which prolonged pre-trial proceedings, it appreciates the professional diligence of defence counsel in balancing these constraints.  

The court also acknowledges the correspondence submitted by the Manchester Business Crime Victims’ Forum, a voluntary body dedicated to supporting shop owners affected by persistent theft. Their clear, measured contributions outlined the cumulative impact of your conduct on business viability and employee welfare. The Forum’s commitment operates within a landscape of escalating operational challenges and a persistently stretched voluntary sector, a point emphasised in their recent annual report.  

A psychiatric report was prepared by Dr Flora Okoye, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose assessment provides valuable insight into your mental state, personal circumstances, and potential risk factors relevant to sentencing considerations. Dr Okoye noted traits of emotional dysregulation and chronic anxiety but found no evidence of psychosis or severe mood disorder. The report also identified a history of adverse childhood experiences and intermittent periods of homelessness, factors which may have adversely influenced your social stability. Dr Okoye’s recommendation highlighted the importance of structured community interventions and cautioned that failure to engage with support mechanisms could increase the likelihood of reoffending.  

In the course of this proceeding, the court was also privy to the Defence’s submission which included a letter of support from a local homelessness charity, RoofWay, emphasising your intermittent participation in their outreach programmes despite ongoing housing instability. Of note, the letter emphasised RoofWay’s limited capacity to provide longer-term case management, given reductions in government funding over the preceding years. This reflects a broader trend affecting support services nationwide — where demand has surged amid funding retrenchment, placing acute stresses on providers and their beneficiaries alike.  

It is necessary to contextualise this case within the broader jurisprudential landscape governing acquisitive crime and its societal repercussions. Judicial attitudes towards theft offences have evolved incrementally over recent decades, moving from a traditionally laissez-faire approach — focusing primarily on value thresholds — to a more nuanced appreciation of offending patterns, including the targeting of vulnerable individuals and community impact.  

The statutory framework under the Theft Act 1968 has remained stable since its implementation, but sentencing practice has adapted in response to emerging trends. Of particular relevance are the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guidelines on Theft (2018), which underscore the importance of considering harm to victims, vulnerability, planning, and persistence as key aggravating features. These guidelines direct courts to impose sentences proportionate not solely to the objective value of stolen goods, but to the systemic disruption and distress caused.  

The Court of Appeal’s judgment in R v. Bannister [2020] EWCA Crim 3247 is instructive in this regard. In Bannister, the court highlighted that sustained shoplifting targeting smaller independent retailers warrants particular concern for its cumulative effect on local economies and the equitable distribution of law enforcement resources. The appellate panel reiterated the importance of deterrence and public confidence in the preservation of these communal spaces.  

Distinct but analogous is the decision in R v. Delaney [2019] EWCA Crim 1718, where the defendant’s repeated offences against a chain of community pharmacies not only depleted stock but precipitated changes to staffing structures and shift patterns. The Court stressed that, while such conduct lacked the violence or gross harm associated with other offences, it nevertheless compromised public safety by undermining support for vulnerable customers reliant on consistent access to medication and advice.

The circumstances surrounding the offence periods are punctuated by distinctly calculated acts, as evidenced by your movements and behaviours recorded across multiple retail outlets. The prosecution’s case articulated a series of instances where you applied distraction techniques, suggesting the involvement of a secondary individual in some events. However, this ancillary party was not charged due to insufficient evidence. It is essential to observe that liability rests solely upon you. Such group dynamics, while common in acquisitive crime, do not mitigate individual responsibility.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

During the relevant period, the local Economic Crime Unit deployed covert tracking methods, including authorisation under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 for directed surveillance of known high-risk areas. Your movements were found to be consistent with these analyses. The technical sophistication involved in these measures illustrates the substantial resource commitment such investigations command. Balancing such deployments against other priorities remains an ongoing challenge for law enforcement.  

Across several incidents, your selection of goods targeted items with relatively high resale value, notably electronics accessories, personal care products, and limited edition confectionery. This pattern indicates purposeful intent beyond mere opportunism. 

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Additional investigation revealed that some of these stolen goods were subsequently offered for sale online via second-hand marketplaces. This practice complicates recovery efforts and raises concerns about the intersection of acquisitive crime and the digital economy. It is a focal point in recent Home Office research, which identifies online resale as a key facilitator of repeat offending.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

These offences occasioned not only financial loss but demonstrable psychological distress to retail staff, several of whom provided victim impact statements. Among these statements, one employee described the persistent anxiety engendered by your repeated presence, which led them to request transfer from front-of-house to warehouse duties. Such impacts, though intangible, result in a measurable diminution of workplace morale and may contribute to staff turnover, a costly consequence for business operators.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

The court has also considered a series of communications from retailers coordinated by the Manchester Retail Association, detailing the operational adaptations necessitated by the offending conduct. These included increased investment in security measures, such as enhanced shrink-wrap protocols, additional CCTV coverage, and deployment of security guards during peak periods. The Association notes the financial burden borne by small businesses in implementing such measures, a strain that often falls disproportionately on independent operators.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

The evidence further demonstrates that many of these offences were committed during daylight hours, implying a perceived confidence in eluding detection or sanction. Your conduct displayed a pattern of calculated risk-taking rather than impulsive or erratic behaviour.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

Despite prior warnings and engagement with Neighbourhood Policing Teams offering diversionary pathways, you persisted in your criminal conduct. Opportunities for community resolution or restorative justice interventions were offered but declined. This recalcitrance exacerbates concerns regarding your amenability to rehabilitation through non-custodial means.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

Turning to the psychiatric assessments, Dr Okoye’s report provides an instructive lens on underlying contributory factors. She draws attention to your presentation as someone experiencing chronic stress exacerbated by economic precarity and unstable accommodation. While she found no grounds for diminished responsibility, she advocates for referral to appropriate community mental health support and intensified case management to address risk of recidivism.  

In the context of your prior convictions — comprising three separate convictions for similar shoplifting offences over the past seven years — it is apparent that earlier interventions have failed to deter. This context informs the court’s assessment of overall culpability and risk to the public.  

The court keeps in mind the principle outlined in R v. Geary [2016] EWCA Crim 800, where repeated offending within an acquisitive crime trajectory was met with escalating custodial sentences in light of persistent breach of community orders and lack of engagement. That precedent underscores the necessity of measured but firm response in the interests of public protection.  

The Probation Service has provided a pre-sentence report recommending a custodial sentence, citing your inconsistent engagement with previous community orders and the relatively high risk of reoffending, absent robust intervention. Despite recognising your personal circumstances, probation assessors observe that continued offending places a strain on local businesses and police resources already stretched thin by concurrent demands such as violent crime investigations and safeguarding concerns.  

It is also worth noting that the Probation Service is itself subject to considerable pressures arising from nationwide staffing constraints and escalating caseloads. Recent official reports have highlighted increasing delays in the delivery of community rehabilitation orders and challenges in securing placements for accredited programmes such as those targeting acquisitive offending, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy tailored to impulse control.  

The court has also considered several seemingly tangential but contextually informative points reflecting the wider social landscape. For instance, national data from the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government illustrates a marked increase in temporary accommodation placements over the past five years, correlating with periods during which your offending occurred. While causation is not implied, this statistical backdrop is reflective of systemic instability that complicates individual rehabilitation trajectories.  

Further, the court acknowledges discussions raised in oral submissions concerning the role of emerging social media trends — specifically, video sharing platforms that occasionally glamorise petty theft “challenges.” While unconnected to your personal circumstances, such phenomena have been noted by sociologists
