IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/05418  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. L. Donnelly  
Filed: 15 September 2025  
  
Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced for offences relating to theft from retail premises, pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. Your offending spans a temporal period from approximately February 2024 through March of this year and principally occurred within the Greater Manchester metropolitan area, encompassing both central and suburban districts.

Procedural History  
You were initially detained on 28 March 2025 following an investigation led by the Manchester Retail Crime Partnership, supported by the local policing unit’s acquisitive crime team. The enquiry commenced after multiple reports from area retailers identifying repeated instances of lost stock consistent with surreptitious removal of goods by an individual resembling your description. Such matters often present a logistical challenge to prosecuting authorities. A pattern of low-level theft may remain concealed without detailed collation of disparate incidents, requiring prolonged surveillance and careful intelligence gathering. The efficacy of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) as an evidential tool is frequently overstated; as experience tells us, footage may lack clarity, be incomplete, or yield inconsistent time stamps, thereby necessitating tedious review and corroboration through witness statements and documentary evidence.  
  
It is lamentable, indeed, that the allocation of considerable police and civilian investigative resources to incidents generating minimal market value results in a steady drain on public sector capacity. These deployments divert personnel from more pressing public safety priorities, such as violent crime or child safeguarding. Your case is emblematic of the broader difficulties inherent in addressing persistent shoplifting within urban environments—a phenomenon both widespread and insidious in its effects upon victims, staff, and the public trust.  
  
After your arrest, you were interviewed under caution on 30 March 2025 at the City Police Station. You initially denied any criminal involvement. However, a forensic examination of clothing seized during the investigatory stage revealed the presence of adhesive residue consistent with the removal of security tags from merchandise—a pivotal point in the establishment of the prosecution case. A charging decision was made on 10 April 2025, with an indictment presented in the Crown Court on 15 May 2025. The matter progressed pursuant to the Better Case Management (BCM) regime, aiming to expedite the exchange of evidence and streamline trial preparation.  
  
The BCM process, though designed with good intentions to mitigate delays and resource duplication, has variously proven inconsistent in implementation across jurisdictions. In this instance, the coordination between the police, prosecutors, defence representatives, and retail crime liaison officers proceeded satisfactorily within the expected timeframes. I record my appreciation for all practitioners involved for their compliance with procedural obligations.  
  
The plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 12 August 2025. At that time, the defendant entered a not guilty plea, maintaining this posture after initial Crown disclosure. Subsequent disclosure of enhanced video footage, augmented by witness statements and forensic analysis, precipitated a late admission of guilt on 9 September 2025, just two working days prior to the scheduled start of the trial.  
  
Late guilty pleas in matters of this nature are all too familiar within the Crown Court’s experience. The law recognises the importance of incentivising early admissions of culpability, rewarding timely pleas with sentencing credit reflective of genuine remorse and efficiency gains. The appellate authority in R v. Wilson [2020] EWCA Crim 789, cited in guidance from the Sentencing Council, emphasises that credit reduction is justified where pleas are delayed until the defence case has become untenable. Accordingly, the extent of reduction afforded to you will be adjusted to reflect the tardiness of your ultimate admission.  
  
Historical legal perspectives help frame our considerations. The Theft Act 1968, a pillar of our criminal jurisprudence, codified offences of dishonesty that were previously subject to patchwork common law treatment. Section 1’s broad definition encompasses intentional misappropriation of property, irrespective of the value involved—acknowledging the cumulative impact of repeated low-level offences upon individuals and businesses alike. The accompanying Sentencing Council guideline for theft offences, revised in 2023, underscores the importance of evaluating persistence, premeditation, victim vulnerability, and resulting harm in calibration of penalty severity.  
  
The case of R v. Edmonds [2019] EWCA Crim 984 is instructive, involving multiple counts of take-away meal theft and shoplifting from convenience stores, with identical modus operandi to the present offender. While the sums involved were modest, the court emphasised that the repetition of offences, in defiance of warnings and diversion attempts, justified immediate custodial sentences in the interest of general and specific deterrence. Although affluent suburban retail targets and premium merchandise were not implicated here, the principle of cumulative harm and the broader community impact remain applicable.  
  
Prior appellate decisions have also addressed matters of dissimulated intent and the exploitation of retail environments. R v. Pearce [2021] EWCA Crim 1421 considered thefts involving novel methods of concealment, including adapted clothing and accomplice distraction. The Court observed that opportunistic criminality of this nature increases the difficulty for vigilant staff and undermines shop security efforts, contributing to an erosion of public confidence in commercial safety.  
  
Notably, unrelated criminal incidents have been cited in passing to identify the contextual landscape of acquisitive crime. For instance, R v. Fenton [2018] EWCA Crim 764 involved a defendant convicted of aggravated vehicle theft and unlicensed modification of motor vehicles, employing stolen parts from industrial sites. These large-scale offences, while distinct from shoplifting, illustrate the spectrum of property-related crime affecting urban economies. Although their factual matrix does not bear directly upon your case, the comparison emphasises the differentiated sentencing needs across varying classes of theft.  
  
The facts before this court, supported by a meticulously compiled prosecution bundle, establish that your offending was not isolated but followed a discernible pattern of conduct across multiple retail premises, some of which employed loss prevention teams and enhanced security measures.

Investigations revealed sequential incidents over several months, frequently coinciding with store restocking periods or staff transition between shifts. Your approach involved sophisticated concealment techniques—including use of loose fitting garments and pre-prepared bags to facilitate removal of goods—and a repeated disregard for store signage and security warnings.  
  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  
  
A repeated feature was the targeting of high-turnover items such as cosmetics, over-the-counter medications, and small electronics accessories. Staff interviewed expressed a palpable sense of unease, noting that frequent thefts led to alteration of shift patterns and introduction of lockable display cabinets—measures intended to mitigate loss but which increased operational difficulty.

Although no physical threats or violence were reported, the psychological effect on retail workers was significant according to victim impact statements submitted by store managers. One employee detailed increased anxiety and an expressed desire to avoid working evenings after your visits became regular. This subtle but consequential harm is a factor warranting proper judicial consideration.

Despite prior informal warnings and the opportunity to engage in diversionary programs, your conduct persisted, necessitating formal prosecution. This points to a troubling pattern of recidivism that attenuates mitigating factors.

Expert Assessments and Supporting Reports  
A psychiatric evaluation was commissioned as part of the sentencing preparation, conducted by Dr Peter Croft, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose extensive experience in acquisitive offending lends particular weight to his findings. Dr Croft’s report, dated 1 September 2025, noted the absence of psychotic or major mood disorders, but identified personality traits consistent with impulsivity, limited frustration tolerance, and difficulty sustaining employment—factors which could predispose to repeated petty criminal conduct. No diagnosable substance dependency was found, although self-reported episodic alcohol misuse was documented.  
  
The court is reminded of the principle enunciated in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, in which a co-defendant afflicted with schizoaffective disorder engaged in acts of arson causing significant harm. The Court delineated the nuanced balance between therapeutic intervention and public protection. While your circumstances differ, the report underscores that clinical input must be viewed within the broader machinery of rehabilitation and risk management.  
  
Correspondence received from Your City Support Network—a charity providing housing and financial advice to vulnerable individuals—attests to their attempts to engage you, which have met with limited success. The network faces acute resource constraints, with waiting lists extending beyond six months for certain services. This regrettable reality exacerbates challenges faced by individuals seeking assistance in a timely manner.  
  
In a letter dated 5 August 2025, your sister, Ms. Bernice H., described familial efforts to encourage your participation in constructive activities but lamented a “pattern of withdrawal” and “unfulfilled potential.” While well-meaning, such submissions do not, without active behavioural change, constitute mitigation.  
  
The Probation Service provided a comprehensive pre-sentence report, compiled by Officer Linda Mowbray, highlighting your limited engagement with prior community orders and chronic unemployment. She notes, however, your recent expressions of willingness to undertake rehabilitative courses and vocational training if given appropriate support structures.  
  
The strain upon probation services is well documented. Recent Parliamentary reports have chronicled staffing shortfalls, increased caseloads, and restricted access to community programs—factors which must temper expectations of comprehensive intervention absent defendant compliance.  
  
The court acknowledges the role played by the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership in collating intelligence and fostering preventative measures. Their operative report dated 22 June 2025 details multi-agency coordination, including police, council, and retail security staff, and is testament to a model of joined-up working which, while encouraging, remains hampered by resource limitations inherent in the present fiscal environment.  
  
Discourse on Societal Context  
It is necessary to situate individual offending within the broader social milieu, despite the court’s avoidance of overt moralising. Low-level acquisitive crime, while less sensational than violent or organised crime, produces tangible drains on community wellbeing and economic stability.  
  
Recent sociological research indicates a correlation between austerity-driven public sector retrenchment and rising petty crime rates. The withdrawal of social supports, increased rates of street homelessness, and the persistence of economic inequality create a fertile ground for recidivism.  
  
Nonetheless, the invocation of systemic factors cannot dilute individual accountability. The respect for rule of law depends upon the expectation that citizens will accord their behaviour due regard. To excuse predatory theft on grounds of hardship risks normalising conduct inimical to social cohesion.  
  
Similar observations were made following the rise of “shoplifting gangs” in adjacent metropolitan areas—groups which co-opt vulnerable individuals to commit acquisitive offences. While no such organisation is involved in your case, the court remains vigilant to signs of organised exploitation within retail crime patterns.  
  
The court regrets the lack of media presence and public scrutiny in proceedings of this sort. Despite the profound local impact of repeated shop theft, cases involving non-violent offenders rarely attract journalistic coverage or wider civic engagement. This invisibility compounds victim distress and renders retail crime less visible as a public concern.  
  
It is also symptomatic of a growing public cynicism toward the justice system—a perception fuelled by delays, inconsistent sentencing, and perceived leniency in non-violent offending. Whether justified or not, such views risk eroding confidence and must be acknowledged even if not accorded determinative weight in judicial reasoning.  
  
On a related note, the case management hearing convened on 14 July 2025 marked a pivotal procedural juncture. It served to ensure evidential clarity and established timelines for submissions and reports. Routine yet essential, such hearings underpin the orderly administration of justice, balancing competing demands upon court capacity and counsel availability.  
  
Appreciation is due to counsel for the prosecution, Ms Eleanor Finch, whose submissions were comprehensive, and to Mr Daniel Foster, representing the defence with diligence despite the complexities imposed by delayed disclosure and scheduling challenges.  
  
It is regrettable nonetheless that legal aid authorisations—particularly concerning expert reports—have experienced avoidable delays in this case, contributing to adjournments and procedural inconvenience. The Office of Legal Aid Provider has faced increasing scrutiny for administrative inefficiencies, which have tangible consequences upon timely access to justice.  
  
Reference may also be made to the case of R v. Haselgrove [2023] EWCA Crim 661, which established principles relating to the reduction of credit for late pleas. Although Haselgrove involved offences of possession with intent to supply controlled substances, the sentencing guidance on plea timing is broadly applicable. The Court of Appeal therein cautioned against the automatic allocation of maximum credit in circumstances where pleas are tendered only after exhaustive preparation of the prosecution case.  
  
Regarding ancillary case law, R v. Clayton [2019] EWCA Crim 1258, engaged with the impact of shoplifting upon vulnerable victims—premising that personal factors such as employee age, prior victimisation, and local economic deprivation compound the resultant harm. This provides context but not direct analogy to your conduct.  
  
A less relevant but occasionally cited precedent is R v. Menon [2017] EWCA Crim 1016, involving fly-tipping of hazardous waste materials—while materially divergent, it serves as an example of how accumulative, non-violent infringements can nevertheless warrant custodial sentences.  
  
Sentencing Considerations  
The court approaches sentencing of acquisitive crime with a triad of objectives: punishment proportionate to culpability, deterrence to future offending—including general messages to society—and facilitation of rehabilitation where feasible.  
  
Your offending, characterised by persistence and deliberate planning, evinces significant culpability. The cumulative effect upon victim businesses and their employees is considerable, notwithstanding the absence of overt violence.  
  
Mitigating factors are limited but present. Your eventual admission of guilt, albeit late, is acknowledged. Your expressed willingness to engage with rehabilitative programs—reflected in reports—offers a prospect, albeit contingent upon consistent participation.  
  
No custodial sentences are imposed lightly, particularly where mental health considerations and personal circumstances warrant exploration of community-based alternatives. It is, however, incumbent upon the defendant to demonstrate a commitment to change.  
  
The court invites the probation service to prepare a report assessing risk of reoffending and suitability for community orders incorporating structured work requirements, cognitive behavioural therapy, and engagement with financial advice services.  
  
Should probationary options prove insufficient to address public protection concerns, custodial sentences of appropriate length and nature will be considered. This court is mindful of the need to avoid net-widening or unduly punitive outcomes in relatively low-value offending, but must equally uphold principles of accountability and deterrence.  
  
An observation on ancillary matters: unrelated co-defendants in various recent property crime cases have presented with more severe offending profiles, including involvement in burglary of private residences and possession of offensive weapons during altercations. Although not pertinent to your case, such contrasts underscore the fine gradations within acquisitive crime typologies and the necessity for individualised sentencing.  
  
In conclusion, I reserve final sentence pending the preparation and receipt of the pre-sentence report. This will enable the court to consider fully matters of personal mitigation, risk, and appropriate levels of intervention.  
  
The hearing has proceeded in open court. I record my thanks to those present, including court staff, ushers, and all associates facilitating process continuity in a courthouse recently refurbished to improve operational efficiency. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days as stipulated by the Criminal Procedure Rules and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980.  
  
These are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge R. L. Donnelly, issued on 15 September 2025 in Court 8 at Manchester Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged unless otherwise ordered. Costs are reserved.  
  
These are the orders of the court.
