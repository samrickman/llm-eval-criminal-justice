IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEYTONSTONE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. L2025/13458  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. R. Rafferty  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentencing following your conviction on a representative count of shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, a charge reflecting a course of conduct spanning approximately eighteen months. Your offending took place primarily between June 2023 and December 2024 in various retail premises located across the Leytonstone and Walthamstow area.

Procedural History  
Your matter first came before the Magistrates’ Court on 15 January 2025, after which this case was committed to the Crown Court for sentence due to the complexity, the history of offending, and the perceived need for a custodial threshold determination. The journey of this case through the courts has been punctuated by a mixture of delays and procedural adjustments, including an adjournment caused by the need to obtain a psychiatric report pursuant to defence requests, and several applications for funding of expert evidence by your legal representatives, which were not immediately granted by the Legal Aid Agency. The delays occasioned by these procedural hurdles have extended the timeline excessively, and this court notes with concern the ongoing systemic issue regarding the timeliness and efficiency of Legal Aid administrative procedures, an issue raised repeatedly in these courts but one which, regrettably, persists.

The court is fully cognisant of the Better Case Management (BCM) guidelines introduced to expedite the progress of cases and reduce unnecessary delay. It is encouraging to note that aside from the aforementioned issues with Legal Aid funding and an unfortunate scheduling conflict arising from a strike by court staff in late March 2025, the remainder of the procedural steps have generally adhered to the intended timeframes prescribed under the Criminal Procedure Rules. This adherence should be viewed as a baseline expectation rather than an exception. I acknowledge the efforts of the court administration staff, legal practitioners, and all relevant agencies in navigating a judicial environment challenging due to resource constraints.

Notwithstanding these observations, such procedural context is merely background to the matters at hand and should neither detract from nor mitigate the seriousness with which this court approaches your offending.

Before considering the facts of your offending and the appropriate sentence, it is prudent to reflect on the wider judicial and social backdrop against which such offences are committed. The reality of shoplifting—or as it is often framed acquiescently, “retail theft”—cannot be divorced from its broader societal implications. In recent years, we have seen a disturbing rise in repeat acquisitive crimes, often linked, albeit not invariably, to structural disadvantage, increased poverty, and sometimes to substance misuse or mental health difficulties. Nonetheless, these sociological observations are neither an excuse nor a justification for deliberate misconduct. The law requires accountability, and justice demands proportionality.

It is perhaps instructive to recall the historical evolution of the Theft Act 1968 itself, promulgated to consolidate and clarify a collection of muddled common law and statutory provisions. While that Act was a product of its time, it has proven resilient, with its key definitions and principles enduring in judicial application despite social and technological changes. Section 1, the statute under which you are convicted, remains the cornerstone of theft offences and is applied meticulously in these courts to distinguish between fleeting lapses and entrenched patterns of dishonesty.

During these remarks, I may refer to certain authorities and procedural precedents to elucidate the sentencing framework. Such references are not intended as didactic or extraneous; rather, they serve to place your offending within the spectrum of cases previously considered and to ensure clarity as to the principles guiding sentencing decisions.

The Crown, represented by Ms Bernadette Price, has advanced submissions reflecting a firm stance on deterrence and public protection, emphasizing the protracted nature of your offending and the impact on local retail businesses and their employees. The defence, led by Mr Oliver Stanton, has acknowledged the plea and sought to present mitigating material, including your background, current circumstances, and prospects for rehabilitation. The court is grateful to counsel for their professional conduct and submissions in a matter which, although not novel in its essential facts, carries complexities requiring careful balancing.

It is notable that you tendered a guilty plea on 3 August 2025, just three weeks before the scheduled trial date. The timing of the plea attracts reduced credit relative to an early admission; however, the court recognizes the practical benefit of securing a conviction without recourse to a contested hearing.

It is prudent to record that the court was provided with various reports and letters during the preparation for sentence, including testimony and correspondence from the Leytonstone Retailers’ Association, the local Safer Neighbourhoods Team, and the community-based organisation 'ShopWatch,' all of whom articulate the cumulative burden and impact placed upon retail staff and owners by repetitive shop theft offences. These materials, while broadly supportive of the Crown's position, refrain from sensationalistic language and convey the impact with measured dignity.

There is also a contemporaneous report from Leytonstone Probation Service, prepared by Senior Probation Officer Ms Hannah Reeves, which will be the subject of further consideration during the preparation of the pre-sentence report. The probation report highlights a complex picture of offending behaviour and personal circumstances, noting your limited engagement with statutory and voluntary services to date.

The Psychiatric Report  
Following an application under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and consistent with the court’s powers under section 35, a psychiatric examination was commissioned. The report, prepared on 21 July 2025 by Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist Dr Adrian Cole, is thorough though ultimately does not diagnose any major mental disorder. Dr Cole’s findings point to mild depressive symptoms and personality traits characterised by impulsivity and difficulty managing stress. Importantly, no psychotic or other qualifying psychiatric condition was detected. Dr Cole cautiously opined that your offending is “primarily a product of social and behavioural factors rather than treatable mental illness,” though he acknowledged that financial hardship and housing insecurity are probable contributors to your risk profile.

It is necessary to pause here and remark on the structural challenges faced by the National Health Service and related social support agencies. The demands on mental health services have escalated dramatically in recent years, with waiting times for assessments and therapeutic interventions extending into months for some regions. Specialist services focusing on acquisitive crime-related interventions remain scarce, and the availability of forensic psychological expertise is limited by underfunding. These systemic pressures invariably affect defendants such as yourself, who may benefit from support but do not receive timely or adequate assistance. The court, while mindful of these concerns, must nonetheless base its decisions firmly on available evidence and public interest.

The Local Authority Housing Context  
Your reported housing situation, as indicated in submissions received from your appointed housing officer, Ms Sarah Duncan of Leytonstone Housing and Homelessness Relief Service, suggests a precarious tenure—temporary accommodation in a shared unit with no secure tenancy. Correspondence on file indicates that the housing team has encountered difficulties in locating appropriate longer-term options, attributable in part to increased demand and a shortage of social housing stock across the borough. The inflationary pressures on private rental markets have similarly contributed to these challenges.

Equally, it is apparent that recent outreach attempts to engage you with tenancy sustainment programmes and financial advice clinics have been met with reticence or sporadic attendance. Ms Duncan emphasised the necessity of consistent participation to stabilise your housing situation, which in turn could alleviate some of the socioeconomic stressors linked to offending behaviour.

Case Law and Sentencing Guidance  
Turning now to the legal framework, section 143 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 delineates the principles relating to the sentencing of offenders engaged in theft-related offences, with particular regard to harm and culpability. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on Theft Offences (last updated 2023) provides an essential matrix for determining the appropriate range of sentences based on the seriousness of the offence.

Noteworthy is the guidance concerning repeat offences and the use of representative charges where multiple similar events have been consolidated for trial purposes. It is essential to treat the overall offending pattern as an aggregate measure of culpability, notwithstanding the nominal single count on which you have been convicted.

Cases such as R v. Whelan [2019] EWCA Crim 2445 underpin the principle that repeated acquisitive offending, though non-violent, can carry sufficient aggravation to warrant immediate custody. In that decision, the appellate court emphasised the cumulative disruption caused to victims and the community, noting that “the psychological effect on shop staff, loss of confidence, and operational costs, when taken together, create an offence of serious consequence.”

Similarly, R v. Young [2022] EWCA Crim 783 addressed the issue of late pleas in the context of theft offences. The Court of Appeal reduced the available credit for defendants who postpone admission until trial is imminent, highlighting that the attendant cost to public resources and distress to victims must not be disregarded.

Comparable sentencing decisions, while factually distinct, provide precedent for the imposition of sentences designed to serve deterrence and denunciation, balanced by considerations of rehabilitation.

The Court also notes recent appellate discourse surrounding the treatment of offenders with underlying vulnerabilities, such as mental health needs or social disadvantage, as reflected in R v. Branfield [2023] EWCA Crim 156, where the Court underscored the necessity of proportionate sentencing that incorporates the availability of community interventions when feasible.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

It is, of course, imperative to remember the court’s twin obligations: to protect the public and to facilitate rehabilitation wherever possible. This balancing act is neither mechanical nor prescriptive but demands a considered and contextual approach.

The Facts of Offending  
The factual matrix, as established by admissible evidence including CCTV footage, police witness statements, and retailer accounts, chronicles a series of incidents involving the removal of various goods without payment. These episodes were distributed among multiple stores, including high street convenience outlets and pharmacy chains, often at times coinciding with shift changes or periods of high customer volume.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

The sophistication or otherwise of the offending should not be overstated. The modus operandi relied upon concealment through clothing and strategic distraction; there was no attribution of violence or threats of violence at any point. Nevertheless, the repeated intrusion exerted cumulative pressure on staff and managers, as reflected in victim personal statements.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

Additional evidence illustrates that security personnel instituted increased surveillance and shop floor presence in response to your actions. There is also reference to a disruption of local shopping patterns, particularly among elderly customers who reportedly felt uneasy during active theft episodes.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Your own personal statements, as recorded during police interviews and in court preparatory documents, convey recognition of financial difficulties but also a reluctance or inability to access support structures. There is no evidence of organised or gang-related criminality.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Despite previous warnings and participation in diversion schemes, including a community resolution undertaken in late 2023, the escalation and persistence of thefts culminated in your current prosecution.

Agency and Victim Representations  
This court acknowledges with respect the submissions from the local Retail Crime Partnership, noting their sustained efforts to mitigate retail crime through multi-agency cooperation, community awareness, and support for both victims and offenders. Their analytical reports corroborate the challenges faced by small retailers, particularly independent shops lacking the resources of larger chains.

Moreover, the Leytonstone Safer Neighbourhood Team contributed a community impact statement, which, while necessarily limited in scope due to your non-cooperation with certain investigative tools, nonetheless affirms the detrimental effect of your offending on local business confidence and employee wellbeing.

It is equally important to register appreciation for the frontline volunteers from organisations such as Community ShopLink and the Leytonstone Foodbank, which have engaged with you despite your ambivalence. Their willingness to maintain contact is a positive indication for potential future rehabilitation.

Conversely, the court records the regrettable but unauthorised intrusion on private property committed by one alleged co-defendant in related but separate proceedings, a conviction unrelated to you but which seeded initial confusion in witness accounts. The apparent disruption to the neighbouring commercial property resulting from an unrelated fly-tipping incident was also referenced in earlier police summaries, though unaffected by your conduct.

There is some correspondence from your sister, Ms Isabella H, which was tendered by the defence. It reflects a conscientious attempt to contextualise your personal struggles, though it does not venture into contested factual territory.

Public Policy and Commentary  
The court takes judicial notice of broader issues impacting justice and public safety. Recent years have seen pressures intensify on police resources, particularly in urban centres, with non-serious acquisitive crime consuming disproportionate verifiable hours of front-line officer time. The competing demands for investigative capacity necessitate judicial sentences that both reflect the seriousness of offences and the practical imperative of deterrence.

It bears mention that the impact of shoplifting extends beyond quantifiable loss. The psychological burden borne by retail workers, many of whom operate on low wages with minimal training in security protocols, is profound. The pattern of fear, stress, and reduced job satisfaction can contribute to staff turnover and closures of vulnerable businesses, with knock-on effects for the community.

Furthermore, the court is mindful of the delicate balance in assigning credit for guilty pleas. While early admissions are encouraged and rewarded, tactical pleas entered at the threshold of trial are subjected to rigorous scrutiny.

In consideration of recent legal developments, including the introduction of tailored cognitive-behavioural programmes for offenders exhibiting impulsive and acquisitive tendencies, the court is hopeful that appropriate interventions may reduce risk of reoffending in cases of this nature.

An adjunct but notable procedural matter relates to the recent refurbishment of the Leytonstone Crown Court’s main courtroom, designed to improve accessibility and technological capacity. These upgrades, while peripheral to the present matter, contribute tangibly to the administration of justice and merit recognition.

Sentencing Framework  
In applying the Sentencing Council guideline, the starting point must reflect the inevitability of a custodial sentence, given the repeated nature and scale of offences. The seriousness of your offending places it in a higher category within the bandings, recognising sustained planning and deliberate infringements. Mitigating features are limited, predominantly your plea and acknowledgments of personal circumstance.

Community sentences with requisite rehabilitation activity would generally be challenging to justify here, given your history of unsuccessful diversion and intermittent engagement. Nonetheless, the forthcoming pre-sentence report will be crucial in evaluating the potential for effective court supervision and treatment.

The cumulative impact on victims, the delay and disruption caused to the court process, and the need to reinforce public confidence weigh heavily in favour of immediate custody, tempered by the need to avoid unnecessary exacerbation of personal vulnerability.

The sentencing exercise must, of course, include consideration of ancillary orders, including compensation where appropriate, but I make no decisions on these in the absence of updated financial information.

Finally, in appreciation of counsel’s service, I acknowledge the diligent representations of Ms Price and Mr Stanton throughout these proceedings and thank the court staff who have facilitated the smooth progression of this case despite workforce shortages.

The defendant is 34 years old, has a prior record including three shoplifting convictions dating back to 2019, and currently resides in unsettled accommodation. There is no evidence of violent offending or gang involvement. Prior interventions, including community resolutions and warnings, have failed to deter.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1} to {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

In light of all foregoing, I will adjourn sentence to a date following the preparation and presentation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the probation service. The report should encompass a detailed risk assessment, consideration of suitable rehabilitation pathways including cognitive skills training, and an evaluation of amenability to community sanctions.

The court will reconvene on 12 November 2025 for sentencing. The formal record of conviction will be distributed to relevant agencies and all parties notified in due course.

These are the orders of the court.
