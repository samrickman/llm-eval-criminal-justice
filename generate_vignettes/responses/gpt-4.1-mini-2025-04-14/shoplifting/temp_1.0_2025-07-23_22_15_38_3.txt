IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTFORD  
R v. MR H  
Case No. HRT/CA/25419/2025  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. A. Fenwick  
Filed: 17 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence upon conviction for an offence of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans a period extending from mid-2023 until early 2025 and involves a series of shoplifting incidents carried out in multiple retail establishments within the metropolitan area of Hartford and its vicinity. The scale and continuity of offending represent a significant pattern of acquisitive crime which requires careful judicial consideration.

Procedural History  
Your arrest occurred on 9 February 2025, following targeted investigative activity undertaken by officers from the Hartford City Police, working alongside the Retail Crime Unit established under the auspices of the Greater Hartford Business Crime Reduction Partnership. This multi-agency collaboration aims to provide a coordinated approach to tackling persistent retail theft and subsequent risks to local economies and community safety. The case reflects, to some degree, a microcosm of the challenges faced by law enforcement and business sectors in responding to repeated thefts of relatively low individual monetary value but cumulative impact.

The investigation seized upon a considerable cache of digital evidence, including CCTV footage spanning several independent and chain retail outlets, as well as telephone and internet activity linked to your movements. That inquiry was meticulous and resource-intensive, consuming officer hours equating to several months' continuous effort before culminating in your arrest. The police officers involved deserve commendation for their diligence amid competing operational priorities.

The initial hearing in the magistrates' court was held on 5 March 2025, where you pleaded not guilty and were remanded on conditional bail pending transfer to the Crown Court, given the seriousness and number of incidents under investigation. The case progressed under the Better Case Management regime, an initiative recommended by the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020, aiming to encourage early case resolution and efficient trial management. Plea and Trial Preparation Hearings took place on 1 May and 15 July 2025 respectively, during which time the prosecution disclosed an extensive evidential bundle encompassing store records, witness accounts, and forensic reports.

Your defence has been represented throughout by Mr Owen Bennett of Bennett & Co., solicitor advocates instructed via the Legal Aid Agency. I acknowledge the competent and professional submissions made on your behalf, particularly in the face of repeated procedural delays occasioned predominantly by administrative backlogs within the Legal Aid system. Such delays—notably the protracted approval of an independent psychiatric evaluation requested last April—have regrettably impeded timely progress. The consequences of these systemic inefficiencies exceed mere inconvenience: they imperil the effectiveness of case preparation and impinge on the fair administration of justice.

The Crown, represented by Ms Penelope Kaur of the Crown Prosecution Service, has applied pressure at all stages for a prompt conclusion, recognising the impact protracted proceedings have on victims, witness availability, and public confidence. That said, the Crown has been considerate in accommodating reasonable requests for adjournments to procure specialist reports and to consider supplementary defence evidence.

The guilty plea, entered at the outset of the trial on 5 October 2025, is noted. The timing of that plea, while meriting some credit, cannot be equated with an early or prompt admission. The legal principles concerning plea discounts, as elaborated in authorities such as R v. Coulson [2020] EWCA Crim 1124 and R v. Cook [2023] EWCA Crim 548, dictate that the extent of credit is proportional not merely to the act of pleading guilty but the stage at which it occurs and the degree to which it assists the court and relieves victims and witnesses from the burdens of contested proceedings.

I make reference to the ruling in R v. Gilroy [2021] EWCA Crim 976, which emphasised the distinction between diminution of sentence deserved due to genuine remorse and expediency motivated by evidential inevitability. While the plea entered today conveys acceptance of responsibility, it is tempered by the preceding course of conduct and tactical timing.

I must observe the unfortunate and increasingly familiar phenomenon whereby defendants defer guilty pleas until trial. This court, as others nationally, is burdened by the cumulative effects of this practice, which engenders unnecessary use of finite court resources and imposes emotional strain upon victims and witnesses. Such behaviour, whilst lawful, attracts proportionately reduced mitigating effect.

It is necessary, further, to situate this case within the broader social and institutional context, which informs the recognition both of mitigating factors and the imperatives of public protection and deterrence. 

The backdrop to this offending is a climate marked by escalating pressures on statutory and voluntary sector resources. Health services experience historic demand for mental health interventions; housing departments grapple with chronic shortages; and police forces strive to maintain front-line capacity amid competing operational priorities. The impact of recurrent acquisitive crime upon these systems is significant, siphoning precious investigative time and community policing efforts from other critical public safety functions. Multiple academic and governmental reviews have underscored this link, most recently in the Home Office report on 'Retail Crime and Community Resilience' (January 2024).

The operation of the Hartford Business Crime Reduction Partnership, established in 2018, has shown promise in coordinating data-sharing and offender management, albeit with recognised constraints arising from staff shortages and competing demands on local policing. Cooperation with retail managers, Safer Neighbourhood Teams, and commercial surveillance providers has improved intelligence-led policing; nonetheless, sustainment of such initiatives is subject to fluctuating funding and policy priorities.

It is also appropriate to note the invaluable services provided by the North Hartford Shopfront Support Network, a voluntary body offering practical advice and advocacy for retailers affected by persistent theft and antisocial behaviour. Their involvement in preparing victim impact statements, whilst circumscribed by operational limitations described in their recent annual report, has materially assisted the court in appreciating the real-world consequences of shoplifting beyond monetary calculations. These organisations operate under considerable strain, with funding often insecure and their staff reliant on the goodwill of community volunteers.

A complicating factor in the administration of justice are delays and case adjournments arising from necessary but resource-heavy processes such as expert psychiatric and psychological evaluations, which are often reliant on stretched NHS and private sector services. Waiting times for such assessments currently exceed recommended timelines, a reality which courts across the country confront regularly.

It is within this comprehensive operational and societal framework that the present matter must be adjudicated.

I now turn to the relevant legal framework and the parameters guiding sentencing.

Legal Context  
The offence of theft, codified in the Theft Act 1968, is defined by the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive. In the context of retail theft, the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline published in 2018 remains authoritative. This guideline provides for the categorisation of theft offences by value, harm, culpability, and aggravating or mitigating features.

In addition to the principal statute and guideline, the court must have regard to the growing body of appellate authority that elucidates sentencing principles applicable to repeat and persistent theft. Case law such as R v. Anwar [2022] EWCA Crim 1042 reinforces that persistent dishonesty matters in sentencing calculations and may warrant custodial sanctions despite relatively low individual transaction values.

I also draw attention to R v. Matthews [2019] EWCA Crim 155, concerning repeat shoplifting from multiple premises, where the court upheld an immediate custodial sentence noting the cumulative damage to community confidence and the disproportionate demands placed upon retail staff and police resources.

Further guidance is provided by R v. Duncan [2023] EWCA Crim 870, which considered the applicability of community-based measures for offenders with complex needs. The ruling emphasised the need for effective, tailored interventions combining supervision with rehabilitative support where engagement is feasible and sustainable.

It is incumbent upon the court to balance these statutory and judicial principles against the facts and circumstances of the defendant, including personal history and the impact of the offending.

Facts of the Offending  
The evidence presented at trial established that on multiple occasions from July 2023 until February 2025, you were observed taking items from various retail shops located within the central and suburban districts of Hartford. These incidents were recorded on internal CCTV systems, supported by witness statements from retail staff and managers alarmed by the frequency and boldness of the conduct.

The prosecution’s case was strengthened by forensic recovery of items found in your possession upon arrest which were identified as belonging to the premises concerned. Electronic transaction analyses, including timing of entries and exits correlated with stock disappearance, further substantiated the pattern consistent with intentional shoplifting.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

Statements from retail employees documented a progression in your modus operandi from opportunistic removal to deliberate planning, including concealment of merchandise beneath clothing and the use of distractions or decoy items.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Witness accounts detailed several occasions when you were challenged by store personnel yet continued to leave without paying regardless. The frequency of return visits to the same premises fostered significant anxiety among the shop floor staff and contributed to altered staffing rotas and heightened security measures.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Despite previous outreach efforts by community officers and the option of out-of-court disposals, including conditional cautions and restorative justice referrals, you persisted in your conduct. This endurance, notwithstanding interventions, gives cause for concern as to your willingness or capacity to desist absent judicial intervention.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

The final incident, which precipitated your arrest, was notable for your alleged attempt to conceal multiple cosmetic items valued at approximately £65.00 in total, removed without payment. That incident was captured in high-definition video, which was crucial in confirming the identity of the defendant.

I proceed to outline the assessment of your personal circumstances and professional reports.

Pre-Sentence and Psychiatric Assessments  
You were evaluated by Dr Miriam Fell, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose comprehensive report was submitted to this court on 10 September 2025. Dr Fell’s considered opinion is that, while you do not meet diagnostic criteria for any major mental illness or personality disorder, there are identifiable traits consistent with impulsivity and low tolerance for frustration. She further notes a pattern of strained interpersonal relationships and limited social support networks.

Furthermore, the report documents a history of episodic substance misuse linked to periods of heightened stress or financial difficulty, though not rising to dependency severity. Dr Fell expressly observes that while such factors may contribute to your offending behaviour, they do not amount to a clinical defence or mitigating condition warranting diversion to secure hospital care.

Your engagement with recommended support services has been inconsistent at best. Attempts by probation officers and liaison workers to enrol you in debt management and employability programmes have not yielded meaningful participation. This reluctance to engage with available support and your repeated failure to address underlying difficulties weigh against leniency.

Of note is the sustained commitment demonstrated by the Hartford Outreach Trust, whose caseworker prepared a letter attesting to your erratic yet earnest efforts at times to attend their sessions, though concluding that progress was limited. They drew attention to the systemic pressures facing charities providing social assistance, with waiting lists and underfunding impeding the delivery of intensive intervention.

Your personal history, as recorded in the pre-sentence report, reveals four prior convictions for dishonesty-related offences, predominantly shoplifting. You are currently unemployed and reside in privately rented accommodation subject to precarious tenancy arrangements. There is no reported history of violent offending, nor any indication of gang association or coercive influences.

Your educational background reveals attainment of secondary qualifications; however, employment has been irregular and largely in the informal sector. You reportedly suffer from longstanding financial insecurity, compounded by familial estrangement and mental health challenges within your immediate family.

The probation officer who compiled the report underscores the risk of reoffending without structured intervention, emphasising the need for tailored rehabilitation programmes addressing cognitive distortions linked to acquisitive offending, as well as practical measures targeting your economic instability.

I acknowledge the candidness of your allocution to the court, which reflects some insight into the consequences of your actions, though stopping short of expressing full remorse.

Contextual Observations  
In pondering these matters, it is worth reiterating that offences of shoplifting, though often regarded as low-level, inflict genuine distress upon victims and communities. Shop staff, many on minimum wage and under-capacitated, suffer from anxiety and job insecurity exacerbated by theft. Local merchants, particularly small businesses, face compounded losses and operational disruptions.

The court is acutely aware of the delicate balance which must be struck between addressing the needs and vulnerabilities of defendants and the imperative to uphold public confidence by delivering sentences that are just, proportionate, and have a credible deterrent effect.

In this connection, the court has received a series of character references and letters from community organisations attesting to your engagement with welfare services. The court appreciates the spirit in which these endorsements have been offered and the efforts of the organisations involved.

It is also appropriate to record concern
