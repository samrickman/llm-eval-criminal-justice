IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/14863  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Sophie M. Canforth  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence upon your conviction for offences of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charges relate to a course of conduct spanning a significant period—from approximately May 2023 to February 2025—involving multiple instances of shoplifting at various commercial establishments situated around Greater Manchester and adjacent areas.

Procedural History  
Your initial arrest occurred on 7 March 2025, following an investigation conducted by the Manchester City Police, working in conjunction with the North West Business Crime Partnership. The genesis of this inquiry lay in the reporting of multiple thefts targeting several independent pharmacies and small retail outlets heavily reliant on local trade. Early indications suggested a pattern of repeated offending by an individual fitting your description, characterised by the concealment of goods within personal belongings and departure without payment.  
It is important at the outset to acknowledge the considerable administrative and operational effort expended in compiling evidence sufficient to support these charges. Police officers, case progression teams, and Business Crime Reduction Officers devote extensive hours to collating disparate strands of intelligence—CCTV footage, electronic point-of-sale records, witness accounts, and incident reports—all while contending with competing priorities in resource-constrained environments. The prize for such labour, frequently, is a protracted and stressful legal process which tests the endurance of all participants, particularly retail staff and vulnerable witnesses. It is a point well worth making that the burdens placed on victim retailers—and the wider policing landscape—in relation to such acquisitive offenses far exceed the apparent financial loss, encompassing emotional distress and operational disruption which reverberate widely through local communities.

Your case has itself seen a degree of procedural complexity. Originally listed for early hearings in April and May 2025, delays were occasioned by adjournments arising from difficulties in securing Legal Aid funding for expert psychological assessments and the preparation of disclosure material involving voluminous CCTV evidence. Such administrative obstacles, while not uncommon, pose serious challenges to the equitable and timely administration of justice. Of note was the protracted discourse between defence counsel and the Legal Aid Agency, which only authorised an independent psychiatric evaluation following persistent follow-up—and only then after several weeks of delay. This state of affairs, regrettably, reflects a troubling trend observable in many comparable cases and merits no small degree of institutional reflection.

The framework of Better Case Management (BCM) has, over the last decade, sought to provide clear procedural expectations for the progression of criminal cases, including those involving theft and related offences. The intent of BCM is to encourage earlier identification of issues, resolution of evidential disputes, and timely plea entries. Whilst this case eventually complied with such benchmarks, it remains a salutary reminder that even fully compliant cases present a significant administrative and emotional toll. 

Following preliminary hearings, a plea and case management hearing was convened on 25 June 2025, when you entered a not guilty plea. The matter was subsequently listed for trial; however, on the morning of the trial scheduled to begin on 1 September 2025, you changed your plea to guilty on a single consolidated count, representing the series of offences. 

It is well-established that credit for guilty pleas diminishes the later they occur in proceedings. The Court of Appeal in R v. Hainsworth [2023] EWCA Crim 987, reiterated that while a plea at any stage should be acknowledged, purposes of sentencing credit must be tempered by the public interest in encouraging early admissions and sparing witnesses undue distress. The principle has been consistently applied across acquisitive crime cases where late pleas, entered only after the strength of the prosecution's case becomes manifest, attract limited mitigation. The court is mindful of these precedents in assessing your position.

Not all procedural elements speak to positive progress. I note with some regret that concerns have been raised about the scheduling pressures at Manchester Crown Court, resulting in constrained listing options and occasional late adjournments. This reflects a wider systemic challenge within the judiciary and court administration—a balancing act amid increased criminal case volumes, chronic staff shortages, and pressure on physical infrastructure. Equally, witness availability and the coordination between various agencies—a necessity in multi-site investigations such as this—further complicate proceedings. This court acknowledges the efforts of court officers, ushers, and listing staff in maintaining order and efficiency under manifold constraints.

In respect to defence counsel, Mr David Fenwick of St. Mary’s Chambers, I formally thank him for his professional submissions and co-operation at all stages. The Crown was ably represented by Ms Fiona Callahan, who presented the prosecution case with clarity and diligence. Both counsel demonstrated a commendable grasp of the relevant legal principles and evidential challenges.

That said, a recurring frustration remains the disjointed nature of communication within the multi-agency environment—particularly between police investigators, local trading standards officers, and voluntary support agencies. Efforts to share intelligence and victim impact assessment data have improved in recent years but continue to encounter impediments attributable to staffing turnover, competing operational demands, and, at times, inconsistent data protection interpretations. This is regrettable, given the demonstrable benefits of joined-up approaches to serial acquisitive offending.

I should also mention the role of the Food Justice and Resilience Network, which submitted a written representation outlining the socioeconomic factors surrounding the defendant’s circumstances, including household food insecurity and employment challenges. Their balanced report emphasised the distinction between understanding and excusing criminal conduct and advocated for proportionate responses rooted in rehabilitation.

Thematic reflections on acquisitive offending and its societal impact provide a sobering backdrop. We find ourselves in a context characterised by rising pressures on public services—health, housing, policing—all orbiting around the tenuous edges of social safety nets. As noted by Lord Justice Hermitage in R v. Cogman [2021] EWCA Crim 1548, repeated petty crime such as shoplifting encapsulates not only individual failings but mounting collective stressors that imperil community cohesion and resilience. It is neither sentimental nor facile to acknowledge the human stories behind these offences, yet such recognition must be balanced against the legitimate interests of victims, businesses, and the public at large.

Repeated shoplifting offences, while often ranked below other categories of crime in the public imagination, carry genuine consequences. They contribute to the erosion of consumer confidence, jeopardise jobs in small businesses, and exacerbate financial pressures on local councils who must reconcile competing funding priorities. Indeed, the Retail Sector Safety Association notes a marked increase in staff absenteeism attributed to stress and anxiety linked to repeat thefts. This is not an abstraction but a lived reality for many.

The legal framework governing sentencing in shoplifting and related theft offences is derived principally from the Theft Act 1968 and elaborated by the Sentencing Council's Theft Definitive Guideline (published in 2019). This guideline directs courts to consider a range of factors, including the culpability of the offender, harm caused, the nature of the goods taken, prior history, and the impact on victims and businesses. It also emphasises the importance of proportionality and the pursuit of rehabilitation wherever possible.

Case law further refines these principles. In R v. Whelan [2022] EWCA Crim
