IN THE CROWN COURT AT BASINGSTOKE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13864  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. R. WHITTAKER  
Filed: 16 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand for sentence today before this court having pleaded guilty to an offence of theft by shoplifting under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spanned an extended period across multiple retail premises in and around the Hampshire region, notably including neighbourhoods served by Basingstoke, Winchester, and Andover policing districts. Your case has attracted a measure of procedural attention — primarily on account of the number of incidents it reportedly encompasses and the involvement of various agencies engaged in attempting to curtail similar acquisitive crime in the locale.  

Procedural Background  
Your arrest took place on 22 May 2025. This followed an investigation that was, by all accounts, multi-layered and involved co-ordination between Basingstoke Neighbourhood Policing Teams, the Hampshire Business Crime Reduction Partnership, and officers seconded to the Regional Asset Protection Forum. This investigatory phase was notable not for swiftness but for its persistence: information gathering extended over approximately six weeks, incorporating a variety of surveillance techniques including analysis of CCTV footage from retailers and transport hubs, interviews with store staff, and the collation of intelligence relating to suspected patterns of theft in affected precincts.  

It is regrettable yet accurate to observe that such cases often expose systemic limitations. While the framework for information-sharing between local business partnerships and police is well established in theory, the practical application is often hindered by capacity constraints and fluctuating levels of priority. As noted in national guidance and reinforced in case management evaluations, these multi-agency endeavours can founder on missed communications, delays in evidence collation, and uneven application of data protection protocols. Nonetheless, in the present case, there is some evidence before the court that these bodies maintained a more coherent collaboration than is average, as found in an internal review dated 9 July 2025 provided by the Hampshire Business Crime Partnership.

Following your arrest, you were interviewed under caution. Initially, you denied all allegations. However, fairly rapidly, the weight of evidential material, including extensive video footage and forensic analysis of clothing recovered from your residence, rendered contest untenable. Your plea of guilty was entered on 2 August 2025, shortly before the scheduled trial date. The late nature of this plea regrettably diminishes, but does not extinguish, the credit you might otherwise have received. This approach is consistent with the appellate guidance set out in R v. Pittaway [2023] EWCA Crim 1027, which emphasises the importance of early acceptance of responsibility to the proper administration of justice and the minimisation of victim distress.  

It is useful to observe that your case has been marked by a number of procedural adjournments, some occasioned by delays in securing authoritative forensic reports and others reflecting the strained resourcing of the Legal Aid Agency. Your current legal representatives, on record since May 2025, have faced a number of administrative hurdles in instructing necessary expert assessments, including a delay of over five weeks attributable to the initial refusal of funding to instruct a forensic psychologist. This is symptomatic of broader pressures within the justice system and funding bodies, which have been the subject of parliamentary scrutiny in the preceding year. I note it not to excuse delays but to situate this matter within the context of systemic challenges facing all actors in the criminal justice process.  

It is noteworthy that the probation service has been hampered by staff shortages impacting the preparation of a full pre-sentence report within the usual indicative timescales. The Probation Service’s difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified officers have been well documented in the annual report of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation (2024). This has direct consequences for cases such as this, where detailed risk assessments and recommendations for rehabilitation programmes are crucial to informed judicial decision-making.

Legal and Sentencing Framework  
The offence with which you are charged, theft, is defined by section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, and involves the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it. Shoplifting, while often perceived as a "low-level" offence, is in fact taken very seriously by this court, recognising as it does the profound disruption such crime inflicts on local businesses, employees, and the wider community.  

It is helpful, before turning to the specifics of sentencing, to review the relevant legal authorities and sentencing guidelines. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline for theft offences categorises offending based on a range of factors including the value of goods taken, the degree of planning and sophistication, use of accomplices or deception, and the degree of harm caused, whether tangible or psychological.  

Amongst the more instructive appellate authorities is R v. Fitzpatrick [2019] EWCA Crim 1578, where the defendant engaged in a prolonged campaign of thefts spanning over a year, and which included theft from elderly shop assistants. Custody was deemed appropriate despite the absence of violence, reflecting the court’s view of the corrosive societal impact of such offending. Equally instructive is R v. Leonard [2022] EWCA Crim 325, where the use of distraction techniques and the targeting of medical supplies led to immediate custodial sentences on appeal. Such precedent underlines the principle that repeated offending coupled with aggravating circumstances warrants deterrence both specific and general.  

Sobriety and consistency of application of credit for guilty pleas in cases of theft were recently clarified in R v. Abbas [2024] EWCA Crim 1122. The Court of Appeal emphasised that late pleas, entered following the collapse of contested defences and shortly before trial onset, garner markedly reduced discount, given the multiplied burden on victims, witnesses, and the court system. You will appreciate that this principle governs the approach to your own plea.  

During the course of proceedings, the court has also been mindful of relevant legislative developments under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022, in particular the statutory emphasis on community-based disposals where appropriate, balanced against the continuing imperative to ensure public protection and offender rehabilitation. In assessing your culpability and devising a proportionate sanction, the court must carefully balance these competing priorities.

It is important to recognise that the court’s statutory remit extends beyond mere punishment. Sentencing must serve the wider objectives set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, including the rehabilitation of offenders and the reduction of reoffending. This is not an abstraction but a concrete mandate. Much as the court is aware of the demands placed upon probation services and rehabilitation providers, those pressures cannot be allowed to dilute the necessity for a robust sentencing response.

Background and Personal Circumstances  
You are aged 35. The court has received a detailed psychological assessment from Dr Francesca Gabriel, a consultant clinical psychologist instructed by the defence. Dr Gabriel’s report, dated 12 August 2025, is a comprehensive evaluation framed in the context of acquisitive offending, impulsivity traits, and some evidence of emotional dysregulation. The report identifies that you do not meet criteria for a severe mental health disorder but notes tendencies towards anxiety and intermittent depressive symptoms. There is some commentary regarding possible early trauma — including periods of familial instability during adolescence — but the conclusion is that these factors provide limited mitigation in respect of culpability.  

Dr Gabriel is cautious in making recommendations for intervention, highlighting the need for structured cognitive behavioural therapy tailored to low-level acquisitive behaviour, combined with vocational support aimed at enhancing resilience to stressors associated with unemployment. It strikes the court that such suggestions are both prudent and proportionate.  

In addition to the psychological report, the court has read the pre-sentence report prepared by probation officer Ms Joanne Mills, dated 4 September 2025. Ms Mills candidly outlines the difficulties encountered in engaging you fully with support services, describing you as moderately cooperative during interview but ambivalent towards structured help. She notes your reported history of transient accommodation, periods of short-term employment, and limited familial contact. Importantly, she flags a moderate risk of reoffending, particularly in relation to financial stress and isolation.  

I also take note of a letter received from the Hampshire Aid & Support Network. This charity offers support to individuals facing housing precarity and financial hardship. Their correspondence, dated 28 August 2025, indicates that despite offers of assistance, you declined access to certain programmes intended to alleviate immediate pressures. While it is not the function of this court to adjudicate social provision uptake, such information is germane to assessing the sincerity of your attempts at desistance.

Victim Impact and Wider Social Considerations  
The court has before it a series of victim impact statements, graciously collated by the Hampshire Business Crime Reduction Partnership and individual retail managers. These statements uniformly express the emotional toll inflicted upon shop staff. They describe increased anxiety, a sense of vulnerability, and in some cases, alterations to work patterns to avoid potential repeat encounters.  

It is worth stating plainly that employees in retail environments frequently bear the brunt of acquisitive crime. The financial loss, while often quantified, is dwarfed by the psychological burden — fear, loss of confidence, and a diminished sense of autonomy in the workplace. This court is acutely conscious not merely of the value of stolen goods but also of the corrosive impact upon community cohesion and local business viability.  

The recent report "Retail Theft: Impact and Response" published by the National Retail Federation (2024) emphasises, inter alia, the dramatic costs incurred by businesses through loss, heightened security expenditure, and staffing disruptions. It reminds one of the indirect costs — including the erosion of public trust — that are rarely captured on any ledger but are deeply felt in affected communities.

Beyond the immediate retail environment, this case is illustrative of wider societal issues. The rise in low-level acquisitive offences intersects with concerns about housing insecurity, mental health provision gaps, and the pressures on voluntary sector agencies. These factors, while not excusing criminal conduct, contextualise the lived realities of many defendants.

Expert Evidence and Predictive Assessments  
In addition to the psychological evaluation, the defence sought the preparation of a report from Ms Elizabeth Hardy, a forensic psychologist specialising in antisocial behaviour and behavioural impulsivity. Ms Hardy's detailed analysis, submitted on 8 September 2025, points to a profile consistent with moderate impulsivity and low tolerance of frustration, but does not indicate high psychopathy or entrenched antisocial personality disorder. The court notes, however, that an absence of a severe diagnosis does not preclude a risk of reoffending, particularly if underlying social and emotional factors remain unaddressed.  

The court is also mindful of Ms Hardy’s recommendations concerning engagement with accredited Cognitive Skills and Thinking Skills programmes within community sentences, aimed at addressing offending-related thinking patterns and enhancing self-regulatory capacities. These approaches align closely with probation service priorities and have been highlighted in the 2023 Ministry of Justice report on reducing reoffending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

The court further takes into account the restraint and dignity shown by victims in the preparation of their statements, as well as the commendable work of local community groups in providing outreach and support in the face of rising retail crime. The voluntary sector’s role, often carried out under difficult conditions with minimal resources, is indispensable in the layered response required to address the root causes and consequences of offending like yours.  

It is also necessary to scan wider legal terrain briefly. R v. Sanderson [2016] EWCA Crim 1231 established that even where offending does not involve physical confrontation, the repeated intrusion into safe commercial spaces may be seen as sufficiently serious to merit immediate custodial sentences where deterrence and public protection necessitate. While you assert no prior convictions involving violence or coercive behaviour, the repetition and scale of your offending intersect with factors that the court cannot regard lightly.

Points from Defence and Crown Submissions  
Before this court, Mr James Rutledge, who appears for the defence, submitted a careful mitigation, emphasising your expressed remorse, the delayed but eventual plea, and your current engagement with probation services. Mr Rutledge invited the court to consider a community order with specialist requirements as a proportionate outcome, citing your relatively youthful age and low risk of violent reoffending.  

On behalf of the Crown, Ms Francesca Hooper acknowledged the late plea but highlighted the persistent and deliberate nature of the offending. She referred to the considerable demands placed on police and retail staff, as well as the cumulative economic and psychological harm. The Crown pressed for a custodial sentence or a custodial suspended sentence order, asserting that substantive deterrence was necessary to stem continued losses and insure public confidence.

Both counsels finally agreed on the importance of a comprehensive pre-sentence report to guide the court’s final decision, reflecting on the viability of community rehabilitation interventions aligned with risk management.  

Community Safety and Rehabilitation Considerations  
The court is acutely aware of the importance of balancing public protection with the rehabilitative needs of offenders. This balance is the cornerstone of modern sentencing policy and is reflected in the Sentencing Council’s overarching principles.  

It is undeniable that persistent acquisitive offenders pose a substantial strain on public services, not least through the diversion of police resources from the investigation of more serious crime. The demand on NHS mental health crisis teams, linked via multi-agency safeguarding protocols to vulnerable adult referrals, highlights the interconnectedness of social vulnerabilities and offending trajectories.  

While your behaviour does not meet thresholds for inclusion in Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), the concerns expressed by probation staff and psychologists regarding impulsivity and emotional instability warrant targeted attention. Access to therapeutic interventions, vocational training, and stable housing arrangements are fundamental to any hope of successful reintegration and the reduction of future
