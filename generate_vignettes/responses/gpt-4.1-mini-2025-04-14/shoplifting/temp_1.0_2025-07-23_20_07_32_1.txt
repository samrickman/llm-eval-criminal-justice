IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIXTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. BX2025/18492  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. L. TRESCOTT  
Filed: 3 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction on a representative charge of theft from retail premises. The offences in question relate to a series of shoplifting incidents carried out across multiple locations in the Brixton and neighbouring Lambeth areas between November 2023 and April 2025. These acts have been prosecuted under the provisions of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, which defines the unlawful appropriation of property belonging to another with the intent permanently to deprive. The circumstances of these offences, though individually discrete and involving items of relatively modest financial value, collectively amount to a sustained pattern of opportunistic and deliberate offending.

Procedural History  
Your case was initially brought before the Brixton Magistrates’ Court on 6 May 2025, subsequent to your arrest on 28 April that year. The arrest followed an investigation conducted by officers from the South London Retail Crime Unit, which had been monitoring a series of thefts from convenience shops and pharmacy outlets across the borough. That investigation was notable for the deployment of covert surveillance measures, including the use of Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) in car parks adjacent to the retail premises involved, as well as liaison with Business Crime Reduction Partnerships (BCRPs) operating in the Lambeth and Southwark boroughs. There were also significant efforts made to obtain and scrutinise comprehensive CCTV footage from five separate stores, which formed the evidential backbone of the Crown’s case.

Initial proceedings were protracted on account of your application for Legal Aid funding to instruct an independent forensic psychologist. The application was first submitted on 15 June 2025 but was subjected to a series of administrative delays attributable to the Legal Aid Agency’s internal review protocols. It was not until 7 August that the necessary approval was granted, allowing your representative, Mr Lawrence Finch, to instruct Dr Monica Bennett, a forensic clinical psychologist with recognised expertise in acquisitive offending and associated behavioural interventions.

The matter progressed to a plea and trial preparation hearing on 25 August 2025. At that hearing, you entered a not guilty plea, contesting the prosecution’s account and asserting that the identification evidence was circumstantial and insufficiently precise. Subsequent to the disclosure of further material, including enhanced and time-stamped CCTV extracts as well as witness impact statements, you reversed your position and entered a plea of guilty at the first opportunity on 29 September 2025. Your counsel has submitted that this guilty plea should attract a degree of credit in mitigation, although it was not an early admission.

It is well understood that the court exercises caution in awarding full credit for pleas entered at a late stage, particularly where, as here, initial denial prolonged the duration of pre-trial preparation and required witnesses to prepare for contested evidence. The jurisprudence on credit for guilty pleas provides clear guidance. As set out in R v. Thompson [2023] EWCA Crim 1234, the discount is proportionate to the timing of the plea and the degree to which it assists the efficient administration of justice. A plea entered at the point of trial commands less credit than one made at the earliest realistic juncture, absent significant extenuating circumstances.

A noteworthy procedural feature of this case lies in its smooth progress through the Better Case Management regime, albeit with some delays occasioned by the aforementioned Legal Aid funding issues. The Brixton Crown Court has historically faced challenges with listing constraints attributable to judicial staffing levels and certain operational discontinuities caused by regional industrial action affecting court clerks and ushers during July and early August. These external factors, though unfortunate, were managed with due regard to maintaining the timeliness of this matter.

In this context, your legal team engaged proactively in discussions with the prosecution to agree upon the scope of evidence and to narrow the issues in dispute. The adherence to the prescribed Criminal Procedure Rules timelines contributed positively to the orderly case management that the court endorses.

It is appropriate to acknowledge the efforts of the Lambeth Safer Neighbourhoods Team, whose community engagement officers compiled a detailed impact report referencing incidents of theft in local shops. Their input, while limited by your own non-cooperation, was nevertheless professional and standard-setting. Similarly, the Business Crime Reduction Partnership provided sustained support to affected premises, collating loss data and staff statements, ensuring victims’ voices were heard throughout.

The court also records its appreciation for the care taken in the preparation of Dr Bennett’s report, received on 20 September 2025. This document, professionally compiled and comprehensive in scope, elucidates the psychosocial factors potentially underpinning your offending, while refraining from excusing or minimising the culpability inherent in your conduct.

In considering the offence through a legal lens, it is pertinent to reflect on the historical context of the Theft Act 1968 itself, which — though enacted over half a century ago — remains the cornerstone statute defining and criminalising theft in this jurisdiction. The Act’s enduring relevance is testament to its clear, principled approach toward the protection of property interests, and its provisions are complemented by a rich body of case law that continues to elaborate upon the contours of dishonesty and intention.

For instance, the seminal authority of R v. Ghosh [1982] QB 1053, while superseded in its test for dishonesty by Ivey v. Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67, nonetheless laid foundational concepts that inform current judicial reasoning. The current standard, emphasising objective dishonesty judged by ordinary standards, is firmly embedded in these proceedings.

Furthermore, the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline (2022 revision) provides structured guidance emphasizing harm, culpability, and mitigation. This framework serves as an anchor for appropriate sentencing responses within a principled approach that seeks to balance public protection, accountability, and the prospects for rehabilitation.

It would be remiss not to touch upon related authorities concerning sentencing credit. The appellate decision in R v. Khalil [2020] EWCA Crim 1218 remains instructive in emphasising that the timing and genuineness of mitigation influence the level of discount available and lends caution against reward for tactical pleas.

Today’s court is mindful that acquisitive crime, while sometimes characterised as ‘low level,’ has pernicious cumulative effects. The losses incurred by small retailers, the dent to staff morale, and the wider implications for community safety are not trivial by any measure, as consistently affirmed in appellate guidance and victim impact narratives.

The facts, as presented and admitted, reveal a methodical pattern of offending characterised by entry into multiple shops during peak hours, often with overt attempts to evade detection but no recourse to violence or explicit threats. These incidents were captured on multiple CCTV systems, frequently showing you carrying bags or jackets concealing stolen goods, and utilising distraction techniques to divert staff attention.

The police investigation involved the collation of diverse evidence sources, including point-of-sale electronic data linked with time-stamped video, witness interviews, and forensic examination of items retrieved or recovered during arrest and subsequent searches.

This case is illustrative of how offences of apparent minor gravity are often part of a broader narrative of persistent acquisitive offending. The cumulative impact on stolen goods, while financially modest on a per-item basis, underscores a sustained engagement in unlawful activity extending over more than eighteen months. It is this sustained nature of the conduct that attracts particular judicial consideration.

Turning to pertinent appellate authority, the principles set out in R v. Jennings [2019] EWCA Crim 2382 resonate closely with the present situation. In Jennings, the court reiterated the necessity of proportionate sentencing that accounts for the pattern of repeat offending, recognising the aggravating factor presented by persistence and the deliberate defiance of prior warnings and community resolutions.

Besides, sentencing authorities have increasingly taken note of the impact of shoplifting on victim businesses, particularly those operating on lean margins and serving vulnerable communities. The stress and financial strain on staff — whose welfare is often overlooked — merit serious attention.

In a wider policy context, the court acknowledges the well-documented staffing shortages affecting probation services nationwide. These deficiencies can directly influence the availability of timely reports and the realism of community orders. The Probation Service’s annual report for 2024 states that caseloads have reached unsustainable heights in London boroughs, with some officers allocated twice the target number of cases. While your own pre-sentence report is expected imminently, the court is mindful that such systemic pressures may affect proposed interventions and their monitoring.

These realities underscore the imperative for sentencing plans that are both realistic and capable of being enforced, balancing individual needs with collective public safety.

It is worthwhile reflecting briefly on recent developments in court security and layout in this very building. The installation of enhanced CCTV and witness protection booths over the summer, funded by the Ministry of Justice’s Safer Courts Initiative, represents an institutional effort to ensure more effective justice delivery. While these improvements offer little direct relevance to the particulars of your case, they illustrate the continuously evolving nature of the criminal justice environment within which you stand.

It is sometimes the case that defendants seek to deflect responsibility by reference to unstable family environments or transient accommodation status. Your own counsel has submitted a detailed mitigation statement, referencing prior adverse childhood experiences, periods of homelessness, and challenges with substance misuse. While such factors merit contextual understanding, they do not operate as exculpation. Rather, they serve to remind the court of the complex human narrative that often underpins offending behavior.
