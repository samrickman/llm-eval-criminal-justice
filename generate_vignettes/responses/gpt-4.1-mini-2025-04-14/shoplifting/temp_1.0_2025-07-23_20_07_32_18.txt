IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. 15CR2025/00437  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J. CLARE  
Filed: 18 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence following a plea of guilty to offences of theft from retail premises contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, as amended. The offending in this matter spans a course of conduct extending over some 16 months, with incidents taking place at various retail shops situated throughout Brighton and Hove, as well as adjacent coastal towns. This case comes before the Crown Court by virtue of the seriousness and persistent nature of the conduct, together with the accumulation of prior history, and has proceeded under the provisions of the Better Case Management (BCM) framework.

Procedural Background  
You were initially charged on 12 June 2025, following an investigation conducted by the Sussex Police Economic Crime Unit in partnership with regional retail security teams and Business Crime Reduction Partnerships (BCRP). This investigation came about after reports of repeated shoplifting incidents across different stores prompted a pattern analysis uncovering your involvement. Coordinated efforts included data-sharing between police officers, store managers, and local authority licensing officials. It is a frequent lament that such co-operation, whilst desirable in theory, too often suffers in practice from resource constraints, shifting personnel, and competing priorities. Here, however, the partnership operated with commendable cohesion, enabling a swift case progression in relation to these offences.

An initial hearing took place on 25 June 2025 at Brighton Magistrates’ Court, where you elected trial by jury and entered not guilty pleas. This necessitated additional evidence gathering and witness preparation, which, although conducted diligently, led to some delay in the pre-trial process. Listing pressures inherent in the Crown Court system at Brighton have been compounded this year by national concerns over judicial capacity and unavoidable sick leave among essential support staff.

It is also recorded that your defence team encountered delays in securing Legal Aid authorisation for the instruction of an independent psychiatric expert to assess your suitability for community sentence proposals. This delay, which extended beyond six weeks, has been a regrettably recurrent feature of modern criminal proceedings. The frustrating procedural hurdles encountered by your counsel echo similar complaints voiced across the judiciary and legal profession and underscore the growing administrative burdens that jeopardise timely case resolution. Such challenges cannot be permitted to continue unaddressed, given their impact on the fair administration of justice.

Following a plea and trial preparation hearing on 3 September 2025, you reconsidered your position and entered a plea of guilty to a single representative count, thereby prompting this sentencing hearing. It bears emphasis here—as recent case law has underlined—that late pleas, whilst not without mitigation value, nonetheless attract limited credit where entered only when the weight of evidence becomes incontrovertible. As was articulated in R v. Jeffries [2022] EWCA Crim 1472, the effective timing of the plea remains a key factor in its assessment for sentencing purposes.

Contextual Overview  
While the thefts before the court are discrete, the cumulative effect invites attention to the broader social matrix within which such offending unfolds. It is incontrovertible that cities and towns across the United Kingdom face increasing pressures from cost of living rises, housing insecurity, and the fracturing of traditional support networks. These factors, alongside shifting attitudes toward authority and personal responsibility, manifest in a higher frequency of low-level acquisitive offending. Courts are not oblivious to such structural realities, nor are they required to disregard them.

Notably, this court observes the protracted strain placed upon public services, including the Probation Service, which remains significantly under-staffed, impairing its capacity to engage effectively with the growing caseload of offenders facing community sanctions. The present case illustrates the challenges of marrying proportional intervention with public protection when resources are scarce. Similarly, forensic units tasked with evidential examination of seized items report increasing backlogs, as volume outpaces capacity. These systemic constraints linger as a background concern throughout the criminal justice process and impose limits on the speed and resolution of proceedings.

It bears mention also that contemporary shifts in court administration protocols—exemplified by the extension of the Better Case Management scheme—seek to streamline caseflow and minimise repeated adjournments. Yet, paradoxically, the often well-intentioned procedural formalities occasionally generate additional layers of documentation and correspondence that prolong timetabling rather than expedite it.

The defence has provided a statement from a longstanding family friend, attesting to your personal circumstances, as well as letters from community outreach workers affiliated with Sussex Helping Hands, a charity operating in configuration with the council’s social services to provide support for vulnerable adults vulnerable to financial and housing instability. Their submissions have been considered in the round, particularly in relation to your housing status and engagement with social support.

The court further acknowledges the victim impact statements received on behalf of several participating shops. These accounts record the distress, disruption, and heightened anxiety experienced by shop staff, as well as the economic toll arising from lost stock and increased security measures. The human dimension of retail theft is often understated; these are genuine grievances deserving of recognition.

Relevant Criminal Law and Sentencing Framework  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 criminalises the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another, with the intention of permanently depriving the owner thereof. Shoplifting, as a subset of property offences, attracts significant attention due to its frequency and the cumulative harm wrought by recidivism.

The Sentencing Council’s guideline on Theft Offences (2019) provides detailed criteria for assessing the culpability and harm attendant upon such offences. Considerations include the value of property stolen, whether theft took place from a vulnerable victim or community resource, and whether the conduct involved sophistication or planning. The guideline’s preamble emphasises the public interest imperative of deterrence, particularly in cases of repeated offending.

Influential appellate decisions bear noting. In R v. Forsythe [2020] EWCA Crim 975, the Court of Appeal reaffirmed that sentences must be calibrated not solely on the immediate impact but on the wider community consequences of persistent offending. The court there upheld a custodial sentence for a defendant responsible for serial shoplifting from supermarkets affecting staff morale and local business confidence.

Likewise, R v. Bromley & Hargreaves [2021] EWCA Crim 2310 addressed the reduced allowance for guilty plea credit when pleas are entered late and accompanied by minimising explanations. While those cases are factually distinguishable, their principles inform the assessment of culpability and appropriate sentencing discount here.

Facts of the Offending  
The conduct in question involves multiple incidents, variously recorded by CCTV and corroborated by witness statements from store employees and security personnel.

Despite occasional interactions with community diversion schemes and warnings issued by store security, the offending episodes continued, demonstrating a lack of deterrence effect.

It is apparent from the evidence that your methods included the concealment of goods in clothing and personal bags, use of distraction techniques, and engagement with staff in a manner calculated to avoid suspicion. On at least one occasion, you were identified removing security tags from goods prior to exiting the store.

The geographic spread of offences, encompassing at least seven different premises, underscores the planning and persistence characterising this course of conduct. Store managers have described a consequent atmosphere of vigilance and unease affecting their teams, with shifts altered to accommodate perceived threats and some reduction in hours to minimise lone working.

Staff have reported experiencing stress-related symptoms, including heightened anxiety and fear of confrontation, necessitating additional counselling support commissioned independently by some premises.

Psychiatric and Social Assessments  
An independent psychiatric report prepared by Dr Susan Marlowe, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, was commissioned prior to sentencing. Dr Marlowe concluded that, while you do not meet the diagnostic criteria for a chronic mental health disorder, there are identifiable traits of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation consistent with personality disorder features. Notably, the report commends an absence of psychosis or mood destabilisation that would otherwise warrant hospitalisation or forensic specialty interventions.

Dr Marlowe further noted that your financial stress and insecure accommodation are significant but not determinative factors influencing your behaviour. Her recommendation includes engagement with cognitive-behavioural therapy modules specialising in impulse control, alongside facilitation of stable housing through social services.

The probation service pre-sentence report highlights a medium risk of reoffending and emphasises your lack of sustained engagement with voluntary sector support services, despite multiple referral offers. The report also draws attention to the chronic overcrowding of local support agencies, including advice centres and substance misuse services, which serve as a backdrop to the difficulties faced in securing ongoing compliance.

It is both a challenge and a matter of regret that individuals such as yourself often oscillate between assistance offered and refusal or disengagement, stretching already limited public resources and frustrating attempts at rehabilitation.

Rehabilitation must be a partnership, not a passive receipt of aid. Courts cannot compel genuine commitment to service offers but must nevertheless consider such factors in balancing risk and opportunity in sentencing.

Additional Considerations and Procedural Observations  
It is appropriate to record the court’s appreciation for the efforts of the Sussex Retail Crime Partnership, whose commitment to collating evidence and facilitating communication between affected parties demonstrates a model of inter-agency collaboration that merits wider replication. Their contemporaneous logs and analysis informed the prosecution’s case substantially.

The prosecution Counsel, Ms Lydia Brant, is thanked for her meticulous preparation
