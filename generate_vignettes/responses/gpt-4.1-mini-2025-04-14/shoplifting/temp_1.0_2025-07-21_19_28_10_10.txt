IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHWELL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14827  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L.A. Penrose  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence upon a charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, related to a repeated and deliberate pattern of shoplifting offences occurring between November 2023 and April 2025, within the Southwell and Newark areas. The conduct, though non-violent, demonstrates a course of behaviour that demands careful judicial consideration given the cumulative impact on retail establishments and their employees.

Procedural History  
Your arrest was effected on 28 April 2025 following a targeted investigatory initiative conducted by officers from the Nottinghamshire Constabulary’s Business Crime Unit, working in tandem with representatives of the Southwell Retail Crime Prevention Partnership. The investigation was catalysed by frequent reports of stock shrinkage from multiple convenience stores situated near Southwell’s central precinct and along the Newark high street. Initially, these incidents were treated as isolated; however, through diligent collation of CCTV footage and staff testimonies, a nexus emerged identifying a single male individual as responsible.

This matter proceeded under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework instituted within this Crown Court. BCM, as most practitioners and regular court users will appreciate, aims to expedite case progression and improve evidential clarity early in the proceedings. It requires the parties to take timely and structured steps towards either a plea or preparation for trial, thereby minimizing protracted and avoidable delay.

Your first hearing, at which you were unrepresented, took place on 12 May 2025. A legal aid application was made promptly, though, regrettably, as is all too common nowadays, the processing of that application met with delay and administrative hurdles, resulting in your instructing solicitor only being formally authorized to act on 29 May 2025. Such setbacks, which regrettably still pervade our criminal justice system, serve neither the interests of justice nor the parties, but remain a reality we must confront.

Initial plea and trial preparation hearings were held on 10 June and 7 July respectively. At the plea and trial preparation hearing, you entered a not guilty plea. Thereafter, following service of a detailed evidential package including a chronology of incidents, CCTV exhibits, and witness statements, you changed your plea to guilty on the 25 August 2025, at the date previously fixed for trial. This late plea necessarily reduces the extent of credit available to you for admission of guilt.

I note, with appreciation, the continuous efforts of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership, notwithstanding the widely reported resourcing pressures afflicting similar bodies nationwide. Their contributions in collating and assessing incident reports and liaising with local police have been invaluable in shaping the Crown's case. It is no secret that these partnerships often function at the edge of financial and operational viability, reliant largely on volunteer coordinators and goodwill, a situation that this court regards with concern.

The issue of sentencing credit for late guilty pleas has been the subject of considerable appellate scrutiny. In R v. Kemp [2022] EWCA Crim 1410, the Court of Appeal affirmed that while a plea at any stage before verdict qualifies for some mitigation, pleas made shortly before trial or at the outset warrant a reduced discount. The same reasoning was reiterated in R v. Baxter [2023] EWCA Crim 1799, a case involving offences of domestic burglary where the defendant entered a not guilty plea until production of overwhelming evidence.

Notably, in R v. Hartigan [2020] EWCA Crim 1105, the Court cautioned that while procedural economy is central to the sentencing discount regime, the demonstration of remorse and acceptance termed as ‘meaningful cooperation’ with the justice process are equally, if not more, vital considerations. This court applies these guiding principles in assessing your plea.

It is necessary to place on record the regrettable but persistent issues attending legal aid administration. The delays in approving funding for instruction of an independent psychologist — sought by your defence to assess underlying vulnerabilities — are symptomatic of wider systemic dysfunction. This was not an isolated instance; authorisation was granted only after repeated follow-ups and protracted correspondence. Such administrative inertia undermines timely access to justice, placing unfair burden on defendants and practitioners and risks compromising fair trial rights.

I acknowledge the valuable input of the probation officer, Ms Fiona Harding, whose comprehensive pre-sentence report provides a nuanced overview of your social circumstances, offending history, and rehabilitation prospects. Equally, I am grateful to Dr William Gerard, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose detailed assessment and report have informed these proceedings. His findings, although not establishing a major mental illness, have nonetheless drawn attention to features of impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, alongside mild substance-related dependence.

There has been correspondence received from local charities, including the Nottinghamshire Outreach Network, highlighting the strain on voluntary-sector support frameworks in the face of sharply increased case volumes. They report resource shortages that exacerbate difficulties in engagement, particularly for individuals experiencing housing instability — a factor of relevance in this case. Such observations underscore the multifaceted challenges attending modern criminal justice and social welfare systems.

The law concerning sentencing for theft offences is well established. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines the offence in terms that continue to provide a solid statutory foundation for prosecution and sentencing. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft offences, revised in 2021, emphasizes the importance of assessing harm — not solely in economic terms but also reflecting the wider impact on victims and the community.

Case law delineates aggravating and mitigating features with considerable clarity. For instance, R v. Logan [2019] EWCA Crim 890 drew attention to the elevated seriousness when a defendant targets vulnerable retail outlets or where the offending is persistent and premeditated. Likewise, R v. Moore [2020] EWCA Crim 1523 reaffirmed that repeated offending within a short period signals disregard for the rule of law and justifies a firm response.

Conversely, factors such as early pleas, genuine remorse, and steps towards rehabilitation can warrant mitigation, as encapsulated in R v. Drew [2017] EWCA Crim 2016. However, such mitigation is necessarily proportional to the circumstances and timing of the plea.

The case of R v. Stone [2023] EWCA Crim 324 concerned a defendant convicted of possession with intent to supply Class B substances within 300 metres of a school. While distinct from theft offences, it offered important guidance on considering contextual harm—particularly proximity to vulnerable locations. This is a point of general relevance insofar as sentencing courts must consider both the immediate and collateral consequences of offending, albeit its direct application here is limited.

It bears mention that the present court has noted a disturbing increase in the number of applications for adjournments based on late disclosure of expert evidence. While the current matter shifted to sentence without trial, the court reminds all parties of the imperative to comply strictly with disclosure obligations to avoid procedural inefficiencies—long recognised as a scourge of criminal litigation.

To this end, it is regrettable but unavoidable that the case was subject to an adjournment on account of strike action affecting court staff in July 2025. These public sector industrial disputes impose significant disruption on the administration of justice and are a cause for widespread frustration across all engaged parties.

Additionally, I remind all practitioners and participants of the ongoing importance of court decorum. The recently refurbished Courtroom 1A offers improved facilities intended to better accommodate vulnerable witnesses; the court expects these provisions to be used with appropriate respect and seriousness, reflecting the solemn nature of our work.

Turning to the facts of the offence, I note that your conduct comprised a sequence of incidents carefully orchestrated to circumvent store security measures. These repeated breaches of trust and law have caused tangible economic loss and psychological impact on retail staff, who understandably experienced anxiety and a compromised sense of workplace safety.

The investigations revealed a distinct modus operandi involving concealment of goods during periods of high customer footfall and staff distraction. On record is the use of multiple exit routes and disguising apparel to avoid detection—strategies indicative of deliberation and prior knowledge of security layouts.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

It is pertinent to observe that while no physical threat or violence arose during these incidents, the psychological toll of persistent targeting on both employees and proprietors must not be underestimated. The resulting atmosphere of mistrust within retail environments can precipitate staff turnover and operational adjustments detrimental to community cohesion.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Furthermore, one cannot overlook the strain imposed on the emergency response and investigative functions of the police force, which must, of necessity, divert resources from other pressing matters. In this respect, low-level acquisitive offences have an outsized cumulative effect on public protection capacities.

In a related matter, I note with regret the status of co-defendant Mr J, who, following his failure to appear and subsequent absconding, remains under active investigation. No fault is attributed to you for his conduct, but the broader procedural context is not without bearing.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

Concerning the impact on victims, statements were tendered from retail managers who described alterations to staffing rotas and the application of additional security measures as direct responses to your offending. These consequences reverberate beyond simple financial loss and merit due consideration.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Moreover, the statement from a representative of the Southwell Retailers’ Association attests to the broader community effects, with some smaller businesses reporting reduced hours and diminished trade due to prevalent concerns about theft and antisocial behaviour—a factor this court views as aggravating.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

In mitigation, you have presented evidence of ongoing housing instability and sporadic engagement with community services. The psychiatric report prepared by Dr Gerard notes a history of depressive episodes and traits consistent with borderline personality disorder, although no formal diagnosis was established. He suggests that your offending may partly stem from poor impulse control and emotional distress linked to this background.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Your previous record reflects three prior convictions for similar acquisitive offences. Notably, a conditional discharge was imposed in 2021, following which you were the subject of a referral to the local restorative justice scheme. Unfortunately, this engagement was relatively short-lived and appears not to have induced behavioural change.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

The probation service’s recent assessment underscores a medium risk of reoffending. Their report advises that interventions focused on impulse control, alongside structured support for housing and employment, may offer some benefit, though highlights your inconsistent cooperation with prior services. The current strain on probation services, facing chronic under-resourcing and rising caseloads, exacerbates challenges in delivering comprehensive support.

This court is acutely conscious of the broader social context in which this offending is situated. The national increase in street homelessness, the ongoing challenges of mental health service provision within the NHS, and the pressures on voluntary sectors all inform but do not excuse individual disruptive conduct.

In particular, it is worth remarking on the recent pilot programmes addressing acquisitive offending through multi-agency collaboration, involving local authorities, police, health services, and community organisations. Though in nascent stages, these initiatives may hold promise for future cases like yours, combining punitive and rehabilitative elements.

Sentencing must balance the necessity of deterrence—both specific and general—with the imperative to facilitate rehabilitation where viable, and to protect the public. Given your pattern of repeated offending despite prior warnings and community-based interventions, the court considers the offending to be of moderate culpability and harm.

Your guilty plea, made at a relatively late stage, attracts a discount, but one that is necessarily limited. Full credit commensurate with early pleas is precluded by the timing and circumstances of your admission.

There is no evidence of any co-operation beyond the plea itself, nor has the court been persuaded of exceptional personal mitigating factors that would substantially diminish culpability. The court also notes your refusal to engage meaningfully with previous offers of tailored community support and the repeated nature of your choices.

Further, it must be acknowledged that the operational burden placed upon local police units, social services, and business partnerships is considerable. The cumulative resource expenditure occasioned by your offending, while not disqualifying a community-based outcome, must feature in deliberations.

Having considered all available information, and without pre-empting the content or recommendations of the forthcoming pre-sentence report, this court directs that such a report be prepared forthwith. It must address the full suite of options, including the appropriateness of community orders with rehabilitation and activity requirements, the feasibility of unpaid work components, and, if necessary, custodial sentences of short duration.

The pre-sentence report should further examine your engagement with mental health and housing services, assess risk factors including impulsivity, and explore any support needs not previously addressed.

I reserve determination of sentence pending receipt of the said report and any written or oral representations that may be made on your behalf.

These sentencing remarks are delivered on this 18th day of September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court of Southwell. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are hereby advised of your right to appeal this sentencing decision within 28 days pursuant to the relevant statutory provisions, namely sections 108 and 111 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are accordingly reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
