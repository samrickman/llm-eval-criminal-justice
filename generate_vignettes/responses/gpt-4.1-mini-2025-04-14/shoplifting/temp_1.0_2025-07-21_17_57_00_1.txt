IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/04139  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. P. Fairbourne  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court charged with a series of offences of shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, reflecting a sustained course of conduct extending over the past eighteen months. The goods taken were primarily from retail premises across the Greater Manchester area, including several independent outlets and high street pharmacy chains. Your offending pattern has brought you within the jurisdiction of this Crown Court and these sentencing remarks follow your earlier admissions in this matter.

Procedural History  
Your first court appearance in relation to these charges was recorded on 21 March 2025 at Manchester Magistrates’ Court, before which further investigations were undertaken by Greater Manchester Police’s Retail Crime Unit and the Manchester Business Crime Reduction Partnership (RBCRP). The investigation was informed by active liaison between these agencies as well as store security teams. The accumulative evidence included detailed CCTV footage, witness statements, and the results of property inspections. The charges were ultimately transferred for Crown Court handling pursuant to the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol, with a view to appropriate trial preparation and eventual sentencing.

It is pertinent to note that the operating framework of BCM, first established by this jurisdiction in 2015, aims to ensure efficient case management and timely resolution in criminal matters. Its proper function requires active cooperation among the prosecution, defence, and the court to prevent undue delays. In this case, the parties adhered reasonably well to the indicative timetable set by the Criminal Procedure Rules, notwithstanding that some adjournments were necessary due to outstanding disclosure and the compilation of forensic reports. That said, the process was temporarily hindered by an administrative delay in the issue of Legal Aid certificates relating to expert psychological evaluation of the defendant, a matter I will address in due course.

It is also worth recording that the Manchester Business Crime Reduction Partnership has, over the past decade, faced notable challenges associated with fluctuating resource levels and staff turnover. Their reports in this case indicate the continued strain on personnel to monitor and document retail offences, which the court acknowledges and considers to be an unfortunate backdrop to a growing volume of acquisitive crime.

The initial custody time limit expired on 5 August 2025, at which point you were bailed with stringent conditions that included restrictions on visiting any retail premises associated with the offences and mandatory reporting to a designated police station twice weekly. Bail compliance has been satisfactory to date. Your legal representation through Mr Peter Chalfont of Chalfont & Associates has been consistent, and I record my thanks to both counsel on the Crown and defence sides for their diligent submissions.

On 8 September 2025, you entered a guilty plea at the earliest opportunity in this Crown Court hearing. Given the timing, the court notes the potential for a reduction in sentence credit; however, as established in the authority of R v. Johnson [2019] EWCA Crim 2320, the timing of a plea and the degree of acknowledgment of responsibility are critical in determining the extent of any discount. In that landmark case, the Court of Appeal underscored that a plea entered only after exposure to the strength of the prosecution case often merits a reduced credit compared with one entered at the first reasonable opportunity. I will apply these principles here.

Sentencing in shoplifting cases, particularly where there is a pattern of repeat offending, presents a challenge to the judiciary in balancing deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines for theft offences are instructive in this regard, emphasising aggravating and mitigating factors, including the frequency of offences, value of property taken, and the impact on victims.

In the noteworthy case of R v. Whitlock [2021] EWCA Crim 1945, the Court held that a custodial sentence was appropriate for a defendant involved in a systematic series of thefts from retail premises, rejecting submissions for community-focused disposal given the offender’s lack of engagement with support services and high likelihood of reoffending. In Whitlock, the cumulative impact on vulnerable retail staff and the consequent economic harm were considered serious. While this case presents distinct facts, the principles enunciated therein remain highly relevant.

Further, in R v. Parkes [2023] EWCA Crim 1011, which related to the repeated theft of prescription medicines, the Court of Appeal emphasised the aggravating circumstances of offences impacting public health and safety, even where the defendant’s own circumstances were difficult. The emphasis placed on safeguarding vulnerable individuals struck a chord that this court recognises in the present matter.

The use of technology and forensic science in contemporary retail theft investigations cannot be underestimated. In this case, forensic recovery of trace fibres and material debris from items found in your possession after arrest aligned closely with those recovered from targeted premises. The role of forensic ecology, increasingly relied upon in regional police operations, has proved invaluable in facilitating prosecution of cases such as yours. While the sophistication of such techniques has advanced, it nevertheless places increased demand on stretched forensic laboratories, competing with backlogs in areas such as sexual offenses and homicide investigations.

It must also be acknowledged that the increasing digitisation of court records, police databases, and multi-agency collaboration platforms, while ostensibly streamlining casework, has also introduced complexity in record management. At times, such systems generate administrative challenges that inadvertently contribute to case delays or evidential gaps. The Hamilton Evidence Management System, in use by Greater Manchester Police, has been subject to a contemporaneous internal audit report citing recurrent data-field inconsistencies, a matter tangential to but worth recording in the context of this case.

The court is conscious of the pressures currently affecting the National Probation Service and the local community rehabilitation companies. The Probation Officer assigned to your case, Ms Amelia Trent, has provided a comprehensive pre-sentence report which is of considerable assistance to the court. Ms Trent notes the ongoing strain from staffing shortages and the resultant delayed scheduling of assessments and supervision appointments. This phenomenon is not unique, but is consistent across similar caseloads in the North West Region and affects the timeliness of rehabilitative interventions. The need for enhanced resources and support to probation services remains urgent if reoffending rates are to be meaningfully reduced.

Notably, Ms Trent’s report identifies a history of non-engagement on your part with prior community orders imposed for similar offences. This pattern is regrettable, underscoring challenges in fostering compliance and rehabilitation. The report recommends consideration of an accredited offending behaviour programme focused on impulse control and financial management.

In the course of preparing the pre-sentence report, correspondence was exchanged with the charity organisation Urban Outreach, which provides counselling and support to individuals experiencing homelessness and financial hardship. While their intervention with you was limited, their letter to the court expresses concern about your precarious housing status and lack of access to stable accommodation, as well as the potential for exploitation by local gangs involved in petty crime. Their recommendation mirrors that of other agencies stressing the need for integrated support to prevent further offending—a challenge complicated by the current housing crisis afflicting numerous English cities, including Manchester.

It is an inescapable reality that social
