IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/13567  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. A. Pembroke  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you come before this court today for sentencing in respect of charges brought against you under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to multiple counts of shoplifting from various retail establishments within the greater Bristol area. The offending conduct spans a discernible period beginning in late 2023 and continuing intermittently through to early 2025. This court is conscious of the fact that your offending touches upon the lives of several community businesses already under financial and operational strain, a consideration not to be lightly set aside.  

Procedural History  
The matter was first listed before magistrates on 15 March 2025, at which time you appeared through legal representation and were granted conditional bail with a curfew attached. The initial charge concerned a discrete incident at a high street pharmacy on Gloucester Road, but subsequent investigation revealed a series of related incidents bearing your description and movements.  
What follows is emblematic of many prosecutions dealing with series offending in the retail context: painstaking evidential gathering; the challenge of coordinating disclosures across multiple premises; and the interface between community policing and prosecutorial strategy. Each stage, from police engagement to case progression, places demands not only upon law enforcement but upon retail staff and ancillary witnesses—who are often volunteers or part-time employees with limited experience of legal processes.  
After numerous administrative exchanges and several adjournments—some occasioned by difficulties in securing forensic reports and others due to limitations on listing availability, notably strikes affecting court clerks—your case was committed to the Crown Court for trial. The court notes in passing the heightened impact industrial dispute has on the timely disposal of criminal matters, a phenomenon that vexes practitioners and adjudicators alike and forms part of the wider context in which this case sits.  
Your initial plea, entered on 28 May 2025, was one of not guilty. Following disclosure of comprehensive CCTV footage, staff statements, and clothing samples, a change was effected at the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 6 August 2025, wherein you pleaded guilty to the charges as presented.  
The court’s attention is drawn to the case of R v. Moonlight [2022] EWCA Crim 1453, a relevant precedent in the domain of repeated acquisitive offending which reiterated principles concerning the timing and significance of guilty pleas vis-à-vis sentencing reductions. Moonlight serves as a stern reminder that while credit should not be withheld where deserved, it must be calibrated in a manner consistent with the conduct and the broader public interest.

It must be acknowledged that the better case management protocols under the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 3 have been observed in this instance. The listing for the plea and trial preparation hearing adhered closely—despite the aforementioned delays—with the benefit of a detailed case progression timetable agreed by both parties. Such adherence to the prescribed timelines exemplifies procedural discipline and aids judicial economy, a factor deserving of recognition especially in the current operating environment marked by COVID-related backlogs and resource constraints.  
As to counsel, I record my thanks to Ms Yelena Kuragin, who appeared for the Crown with notable professionalism, and to Mr James O’Toole, acting on your behalf, who likewise conducted the defence with commendable rigour despite challenges posed by the administrative delays encountered in relation to Legal Aid.

Prior to addressing the specifics of the offending, it is appropriate to reflect on the environment in which such conduct has escalated. The current social fabric of the city, like many urban areas across England, is marked by increased economic pressures, housing precarity, and rising public frustration. The visible rise of street-level anti-social behaviour and petty theft speaks not only to individual choices but also to systemic vulnerabilities.  
An ancillary observation might be made on the role of community and voluntary sector bodies in such contexts. The Bristol Shopkeepers’ Association, for instance, has issued repeated pleas for enhanced police resourcing and improved data-sharing frameworks to curb the impact of persistent theft on small businesses. The association’s correspondence—which has been received by this court—highlights the disproportionate psychological toll on employees who, despite minimal formal protections, find themselves the front line in a seemingly unending cycle of dishonesty and loss.  
Of procedural note: the application on your behalf to instruct an independent forensic psychologist was made on 11 June 2025 but experienced delay in approval from the Legal Aid Agency, being finally authorised on 29 July after protracted correspondence. Such delays, regrettably, reiterate ongoing systemic issues within the legal aid framework, which impact all parties and the administration of justice at large.

Turning to the jurisprudential sphere, it is instructive to recall R v. Fennessy [2023] EWCA Crim 1267, a case in which the Court of Appeal expounded upon the principle that repeated acquisitive offending, though often of relatively low individual monetary value, can accumulate to produce significant detriment both to victims and to community confidence in lawful order. While Fennessy concerned a broader scale of theft involving commercial cargo theft across multiple counties, the underlying principle of cumulative harm applies equally in more localised settings.  
A further consideration arises from R v. Clinton [2019] EWCA Crim 2291, wherein the court addressed the issue of mitigating credit in the context of guilty pleas entered post-full trial preparation but prior to opening statements. The court retained discretion to apply reduction, but cautioned against an automatic or generous scale of discount where pleas come only after the inevitable prospect of conviction becomes apparent.  
I direct counsel to the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline (effective date 1 December 2021), which provides the current framework for evaluating seriousness, culpability, and harm. The guideline prudently differentiates between isolated incidents and sustained courses of conduct, emphasising the importance of considering the full impact—not merely economic loss, but emotional and psychological consequences as well.

This case draws urgent attention to the challenges faced by retail staff in adapting to repeated offending. Their accounts, as gathered by police community liaison officers, reveal genuine anxiety and a measure of fear regarding your repeated presence and conduct; anecdotal reports include instances of staff adjusting shift patterns and requesting additional security measures to mitigate perceived risk.  
Similar concerns have been raised in the past about the effects of persistent offending on vulnerable shop workers, notably in the report by the Home Office entitled Retail Crime: The Hidden Struggles, published March 2024. The report highlights that employees in smaller or independent stores have limited access to dedicated security personnel or support networks, magnifying the consequences of recurring theft.  
Notably, there were no physical assaults or threats in this case. Nonetheless, the cumulative stress and diminished sense of safety place an invisible but palpable strain upon the workforce and the local economy. The court has seen in previous trials similar episodes where staff absenteeism rose in the wake of repeated low-level crime, impinging upon operational efficiency.

The psychological assessment commissioned for sentencing provides a nuanced portrait of your personal circumstances and mental state. Dr Rajiv Shah, consultant forensic psychiatrist, offers that while you do not suffer from disorders of a severe nature, there are identifiable features of impulsivity and low frustration tolerance which, combined with intermittent substance misuse, have contributed to your offending behaviour.  
Of interest is Dr Shah’s observation relating to non-engagement with available support networks. Despite repeated offers from community outreach workers and probation officers of assistance with housing, employment readiness, and addiction counselling, your participation has been sporadic and at times dismissive.  
The report further acknowledges the complexity of disentangling causation and choice, an enduring challenge in cases where economic hardship intersects with behavioural risk factors. This emphasises the multifactorial nature of offending but does not serve to exonerate persistent criminal conduct.  
The Probation Service’s pre-sentence report, compiled by Officer Helen Whitaker, corroborates these findings and suggests a tailored supervisory plan incorporating cognitive behavioural interventions alongside negotiated medication reviews and reinforced engagement pathways with social services.

The court must also observe the ongoing pressures faced by local probation teams. The Avon and Somerset Probation Trust, like many regional services, has been grappling with staffing shortages and increasing caseloads since 2023. The workload increase arises in no small part from the widespread rise in acquisitive crimes and associated breaches of community orders. These operational pressures, though external to the defendant’s immediate context, form a backdrop to the feasibility of rehabilitative programmes and thus influence recommendations for sentence management and resource allocation.  
Additionally, the reports reflect enduring difficulties with housing provision. The shortage of affordable housing in Bristol—particularly in the more deprived districts—is well documented. The Local Authority’s Housing Needs Assessment, published earlier this year, sets out systemic shortfalls, with waiting lists growing year on year. Such factors impact defendants with unstable tenancies, complicating the prospect of stable reintegration and compliance with community sentences.  
It is worth noting that your own housing situation remains precarious, residing currently in temporary accommodation that lacks permanence or security. The court accepts these conditions provide at least a partial explanatory context for your conduct, albeit not a justification.

The submissions made on your behalf emphasise the effect of underlying financial hardship, fluctuating mental health, and a lack of consistent family support. Counsel has highlighted letters received from local charities, including Bristol Homeless Outreach and the Community Care Agency, suggesting that you have expressed willingness to engage with support services in the future. Such representations have been taken into consideration.  
However, it must be emphasised that the court’s paramount concern is public protection and the prevention of reoffending. The sincerity of retrospective commitments to change cannot be divorced from past conduct and the realities of sustained acquisitive offending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

Among the more peripheral but not irrelevant considerations is the role played by the Business Crime Reduction Partnership for Bristol City Centre. Since its establishment in 2019, the partnership has aimed to co-ordinate responses to shop theft and associated anti-social behaviour through improved intelligence sharing, community liaison, and support for affected businesses.  
In this instance, the partnership swiftly flagged multiple incidents linked to your conduct, enabling local law enforcement to prioritise their response. It is encouraging to note that such collaborative approaches, designed to harness the capabilities of private and public stakeholders, are beginning to yield measurable improvements—even as resource limitations and operational setbacks persist.  
The court also acknowledges, with regret, several tragic occurrences unrelated to this case but illustrative of the broader context. For instance, the recent conviction in R v. Gardiner [2025] EWCA Crim 811 concerned aggravated robbery with injury in a nearby district, revealing the stark contrast between offences of violence and acquisitive breaches, yet highlighting the shared trajectory of marginalisation and systemic vulnerability.  
These matters, while distant from your own offending, demonstrate the layered burdens with which criminal justice practitioners must grapple: prioritisation across a spectrum of harm, calibration of response, and the ever-present challenge of finite resources.

The defendant’s prior record, as disclosed, includes several police cautions for similar conduct, notably from 2021 and 2022, and a community resolution issued in 2023 following a diversion programme in respect of attempted retail theft. Such history informs the court’s assessment of both culpability and risk, underscoring a concerning pattern of recidivism.  
Furthermore, it is regrettable that previous interventions do not appear to have precipitated sustained behavioural change. This, of course, is not uncommon in cases involving entrenched acquisitive offending but nevertheless weighs heavily against any argument for leniency grounded solely in inexperience or youthful error, given that you are now 35 years of age.

I take this opportunity to note the difficulties faced by officers of the Bristol City Police Safer Neighbourhood Team, who have invested significant effort coordinating victim statements, securing disclosure, and supporting local businesses amid heightened workloads. The national increase in street-level theft has strained policing resources, requiring redirection from other priorities. Such impacts cannot be discounted in the holistic assessment of public protection needs and future risk.  
Similarly, the cross-sector collaboration with the city’s Social Services department, though hindered by longstanding funding shortfalls, continues to play a critical role—particularly when defendants exhibit vulnerabilities meriting safeguarding interventions.

The court has also considered various collateral materials presented, including letters from your sister and statements from representatives of community support groups. While these documents evince a measure of support and encouragement for your rehabilitation, they do not negate the seriousness of your offending or diminish the necessity for an appropriately calibrated sanction.  
It bears noting that the defendant’s handwriting, exhibited in submissions to the court, is legible and neatly formatted—this small detail, while not legally material, expresses a measure of care and engagement that is positive.

I must in fairness address the observation raised in defence submissions that your initial plea was delayed to allow time for reflection and instruction of legal advisors, and that your eventual admission of guilt avoided the need for a contested trial. This is to be acknowledged. However, as per the judgments in R v. Dacre [2022] EWCA Crim 1021 and R v. Tillotson [2020] EWCA Crim 1785, late pleas offer only limited reduction, especially where the evidence was overwhelming and the delay prolonged.  
The court is not unsympathetic to the pressures defendants face in navigating complex legal processes, yet it must balance these against the interests of victims and the public in prompt resolution.

In consideration of all these factors, it is appropriate at this juncture for a comprehensive pre-sentence report to be prepared. Such report should address the full scope of your circumstances, including housing stability, engagement with support services, and any identified pathways to reduce the likelihood of reoffending. I direct that the probation officer consider the feasibility of cognitive skills interventions, addiction support where applicable, and structured unpaid work.  
Furthermore, evaluation should be made of any potential for restorative justice engagement, balancing the views of the victim businesses with your capacity for meaningful participation.
