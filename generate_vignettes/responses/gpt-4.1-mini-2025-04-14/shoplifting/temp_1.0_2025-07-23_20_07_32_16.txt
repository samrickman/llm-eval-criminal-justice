IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIXTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14876  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. L. KEATING  
Filed: 11 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence in respect of charges arising from offences committed on various dates throughout 2024 and into early 2025, principally connected with theft from retail premises contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour is characterised by deliberate, repeated shoplifting at multiple commercial establishments within the Brixton and surrounding boroughs.

Procedural History  
You were first arrested on 17 February 2025 following a targeted operation coordinated by the Brixton Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP) and the Metropolitan Police Service’s Acquisitive Crime Unit. The investigation, as recorded in the disclosure material, was initiated subsequent to several reports of theft by local retailers who noted a suspiciously high incidence of missing stock — particularly targeting hygiene products, over-the-counter medications, and small electronic accessories. The piecing together of the case involved painstaking collation of security recordings, store logs, and witness statements drawn from no fewer than seven distinct premises, spread over a period of approximately thirteen months.  
This court observes, with no small degree of consternation, the increasing prevalence of such cases and the concomitant pressure placed upon police and retail security teams alike. The upward trend in acquisitive offences, especially those involving persistent offenders who repeatedly return to the same premises or commercial districts, presents a twofold challenge: first, the strain upon shops and their workers, whose ability to provide customer service is compromised by the ever-present threat of theft; and second, the considerable allocation of public resources necessary to investigate and prosecute these offences.  
The investigation was by no means a routine patrol result. Rather, it involved the deployment of officers tasked with observing various high-risk locations, the use of covert surveillance technology, and the careful analysis of both digital and physical evidence. The subsequent arrest was the product of these combined efforts, demonstrating the lengths to which law enforcement must go in order to build a coherent and admissible case against the accused in such matters.

Following your arrest, you were interviewed under caution. Initially, you denied involvement, though confronted with compelling video evidence — notably footage capturing your presence at the premises at times coinciding with the thefts — you eventually entered a change of plea to guilty. The charges, originally encompassing multiple counts, were consolidated into a single indictment representing a course of conduct for sentencing purposes.  
Your first hearing before this court occurred on 25 March 2025, during which time your initial legal representation was secured through a representation order issued by the Legal Aid Agency. This court has had occasion to reflect in other cases upon the regrettable delays and administrative inefficiencies within the Agency, a theme we revisit presently, and their unfortunate impact on the timeliness of justice. The initial plea and trial preparation hearing was held promptly by Brixton Crown Court standards, with subsequent case management hearings remaining broadly within necessary procedural timeframes, despite some short adjournments occasioned by legal aid funding clarifications and report gathering.  

The Better Case Management (BCM) protocols were applied from the outset. These procedural principles, designed to ensure early identification of issues and encourage plea negotiations, are vital in cases such as this where evidential material is voluminous and spans multiple sites. It is regrettable but not uncommon that, even under BCM, cases involving multiple charges and numerous witnesses experience some inevitable delay owing to compounding factors such as report preparation, legal representation changes, and the need for expert evaluation.  
In particular, this case saw an application at the request of the defence for psychiatric and psychological assessment to be undertaken, with instructions eventually granted on 12 May 2025, following extended correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency. The delay was not due to any lack of diligence on the part of defence counsel but was emblematic of systemic challenges faced when attempting to secure funding for expert evidence—obstacles that this court has repeatedly called upon the Legal Aid Agency to address with greater urgency.  
Nonetheless, I acknowledge with respect the efforts of Ms Lucy Kirkland, instructing solicitor, and Mr Edward Pavlov, leading counsel, who have conducted proceedings with due professionalism despite these impediments.

I also acknowledge the contributions of the probation service, in particular Ms Sharon Wilde, who submitted a pre-sentence report preliminary to sentencing, albeit with some reservations expressed about the comprehensiveness of your engagement with proposed programmes and services. The report is detailed and professionally compiled, providing a granular assessment of your background, offence history, and assessed risk.

It is useful, at this juncture, to consider the broader social context within which offences such as these occur. The social fabric of Brixton and neighbouring districts has, over recent years, exhibited signs of strain familiar to urban centres across the country. Rising economic insecurity, a marked increase in street homelessness, and a reduction in accessible mental health services have all contributed to an environment in which acquisitive offences, including shoplifting, may become more prevalent. Community policing levels have faced sustained reductions, and the demands on voluntary sector organisations—such as food banks and crisis accommodation providers—have grown accordingly.  
None of this excuses criminal behaviour. But it informs the multifaceted approach necessary in responding to such offenders. Courts are tasked not merely with punishment but with considerations relating to rehabilitation, public protection, and the prevention of reoffending.

Recent published data from the Brixton Safer Neighbourhood Team notes a 12% rise in retail theft reports between 2023 and 2024, with significant clustering around transport interchanges and high footfall shopping streets. While some retailers have invested in electronic anti-theft measures and increased staffing, these come at a cost ultimately borne by consumers and taxpayers alike. The court reiterates its appreciation for those retailers and their staff who assist and collaborate with police investigations, often at personal inconvenience.

The procedural history also bears reference to a series of voluntary sector inputs. Notably, an assessment was submitted by the local charity Helping Hands Brixton, detailing efforts to engage you with housing support services. Their letter underscored the challenges faced by individuals with unstable accommodation and touching briefly upon the availability of budgeting advice and employment programmes. It is regrettable that engagement was limited and inconsistent.

Your counsel has submitted a written plea statement reflecting a degree of remorse. This statement, while carefully composed, notably declines to admit certain factual particulars and calls for measured reflection upon the personal circumstances contributing to your offending. The statement was accompanied by letters of support from family members and a community mentor associated with the Brixton Reengagement Project, who vouch for your character outside of the offending context. Whether these representations carry significant weight will be a matter for sentence.

In the course of considering sentencing, the court must, as always, have regard to authority providing guiding principles. I mention the seminal rulings in R v. Roberts [2005] EWCA Crim 2474 and R v. Fox [2010] EWCA Crim 2349, which set out key factors in the assessment of theft offences including the value of stolen goods, planning and sophistication, and impact on victims and the public. The Sentencing Council’s definitive Theft guideline also remains pivotal, emphasising the evaluation of the offender’s culpability, the scale and frequency of offending, and any aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

The court further notes the judgments of R v. Mellor [2018] EWCA Crim 1207, which dealt with cases of repeat shoplifting, underscoring the importance of measures aiming to break cycles of offending through tailored community interventions, and R v. Tewari [2019] EWCA Crim 1054 concerning the impact of late guilty pleas where offenders contest charges until the evidential case becomes overwhelming.

Consideration must be given to credit awarded for admissions of guilt. It is now well established in law, including the recent judgment in R v. Carlton [2023] EWCA Crim 825, that early resolution brings significant benefit not only to the court but, critically, to victims and witnesses who are spared the trauma and inconvenience of protracted proceedings. However, credit is reduced proportionally where pleas are delayed until late in the process—a factor this court weighs accordingly.

It is pertinent to observe that, unlike in R v. Crewe [2017] EWCA Crim 1461 where the offending included significant use of violence and threats, your conduct did not involve physical aggression. Nonetheless, the recurrent nature of your offending was undoubtedly calculated and beyond mere opportunism, as demonstrated by the pattern of behaviour and the selection of specific goods for theft.

This conduct must be viewed alongside the impact information obtained from victim statements and supporting agencies. Staff at various retail outlets have described a climate of unease and increased stress, some reporting changes to working practices, including reduced opening hours and heightened security vigilance. Such collateral consequences, though intangible, represent real harm and are rightfully factored into sentencing considerations.

In preparing these remarks, I have reviewed a report from Dr Fiona McLaughlin, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose assessment, commissioned by the defence, is dated 14 July 2025. Dr McLaughlin observed traits consistent with anxiety and low mood, but no diagnosable major mental disorder that would materially affect culpability or diminish criminal responsibility. The report notes difficulties with impulse control and references a moderate history of substance misuse, although current usage was not significantly harmful. She recommends psychological support and engagement with community services, but cautions against any suggestion that psychiatric intervention alone would resolve the problematic behaviours that led to offending.

It is regrettable that engagement with offered support services appears to have been sporadic. The pre-sentence report prepared by the probation service echoes this concern and highlights the limited uptake of available community-based resources. The report outlines
