IN THE CROWN COURT AT WINDSOR  
R v. MR H  
Case No. D2025/14527  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. T. Ellwood  
Filed: 3 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing having entered a plea of guilty to a charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans a sustained period during the course of 2024 and early 2025 and involves multiple retail premises within the Windsor and surrounding South Thames catchment area. Although the charge has been consolidated, the case before the court is recognised as representing a pattern of repeated, deliberate thefts which have attracted the attention of policing and retail crime partnerships across multiple jurisdictions.

Procedural Background  
Your arrest took place on 13 March 2025 following a detailed, multi-agency investigation involving the Windsor Borough Police, the Thames Valley Fraud and Theft Unit, and the local Retail Crime Intelligence Unit. This inquiry was itself instigated by a growing number of reported thefts from high street convenience stores, principally those serving residential areas with considerable social housing stock. Initial investigations were hampered by the usual difficulties endemic to retail theft cases: intermittent and incomplete CCTV footage, partially illegible client statements, and an often ambivalent approach to reporting by store management, hampered in part by concerns regarding staff availability and resource prioritisation.

The Better Case Management (BCM) protocol was engaged promptly following your charge on 27 March 2025, facilitating coordinated scheduling of hearings, disclosure of evidence, and pre-trial case reviews. It is worthy of note that the case progressed within the expected statutory time limits despite the regrettable but now familiar bureaucratic challenges presented by the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted processing of applications for specialist reports. This court reiterates its concern as to the administrative friction that frequently impedes expeditious case progression, a matter addressed in recent observations by the Sentencing Council and reiterated in the judicial review of legal aid arrangements (R (Jackson) v Legal Aid Agency [2024] EWHC 813 (Admin)).

The court notes with some regret that these delays often cause distress to all parties involved, not least victims and witnesses, whose cooperation is invaluable yet vulnerable to the erosion of patience and resolve. It is an unfortunate but perennial reality that the justice system's best intentions are too often undermined by shortcomings in administrative capacity.

During the course of preparation, liaison was maintained with the Windsor Retail Crime Partnership. This body, albeit operating within a constrained budget and understaffed relative to demand, provides critical coordination between retailers, licensing authorities, and enforcement agencies. Their reports detail both the direct and indirect impact of persistent theft on local businesses, including loss of revenue, increased insurance premiums, and the cost of heightened security measures which are often borne disproportionately by smaller independent traders.

It is pertinent to mention that the Windsor Retail Crime Partnership coordinates with local community safety schemes such as the Safer Streets Initiative and contributes to the ongoing discourse on the allocation of resources within the police force toward acquisitive crime prevention. Nonetheless, the incremental rise in shoplifting incidents over recent years presents challenges not wholly surmountable by inter-agency collaboration alone.

These circumstances illustrate the complex and resource-intensive nature of prosecuting repeated retail thefts. The investigatory effort required to assemble evidence sufficient to secure convictions cannot be overstated. Police officers, dispatched for what may appear to outsiders as “minor crimes,” frequently devote multiple shifts to follow-up inquiries, witness interviews, and evidential gathering. The cumulative time commitment thus represents a significant drain on wider public safety operations.

The Legal Aid Agency’s procedural handling of defence counsel’s application for authority to instruct a community forensic psychologist was subject to repeated delay, with formal authority only granted on 16 July 2025 after protracted correspondence spanning six weeks. This delay impeded timely assessment of the defendant’s psychosocial circumstances and potential mitigating factors, a situation lamentably typical in many court proceedings today. While the expertise of Dr Alice Ramachandran, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, was ultimately secured, the report’s late provision meant it could not be considered ahead of the plea stage, limiting its immediate utility.

This court places on record its appreciation for the diligent efforts of Ms Hannah Wilcox, probation officer, whose pre-sentence report was submitted promptly. As this court has commented on numerous occasions, the probation service is currently stretched thin, coping with rising caseloads, reductions in administrative staffing, and pressures arising from the statutory obligations of Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) alongside Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARAC).

The existing pressures on probation personnel, as well as on shelter and mental health support services, create a wider systemic context within which cases such as this must be understood. Public sector capacity is demonstrably insufficient to meet demand, a fact lamented in reports issued by the Inspectorate of Probation (Annual Report 2024-25) and NHS England’s recent briefing on adult mental health service backlogs, which indicate waiting times exceeding 18 months in certain areas for specialist psychological therapy.

Of course, it cannot be assumed that systemic failure excuses individual offending. The prosecution of shoplifting offences reflects not only the imperative to uphold property rights but the necessity of preserving social order and the rule of law within communities increasingly fatigued by acquisitive crime.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Turning to legal precedent, the court recalls the principles outlined in R v. Carter [2019] EWCA Crim 1453, which elucidated the courts’ approach to repeat acquisitive offending by emphasising proportionality and the importance of sentencing objectives such as deterrence and rehabilitation. Carter guided that custodial sentences are not to be imposed lightly in theft offences where the monetary value is low but acknowledged that persistence, planning, and impact on victims may justify immediate custody.

Further illumination is derived from R v. Sanderson [2022] EWCA Crim 831, which considered the significance of co-offenders’ conduct when assessing culpability. Though co-defendants' actions are sometimes misattributed, care must be taken not to conflate their offending with that of the defendant absent clear evidential linkage. The court takes this duty seriously in the present matter.

A brief digression on related case law of note includes the decision in R v. Bennet [2020] EWCA Crim 908, involving criminal damage to a community centre by an unrelated party, where the sentencing judge pointed to the corrosive effect of antisocial behaviour upon communal cohesion. Though irrelevant to the facts here, the court notes the broader theme of how seemingly minor crimes contribute to social instability.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The multi-faceted impact of your offending involves not merely the direct economic loss to retailers but the psychological consequences borne by staff. Victim personal statements detail increased anxiety, the imposition of restrictive measures such as locked displays, and the practical ramifications of shift pattern alterations. It is emphasised that these effects ripple outward, impacting not just individual employees but entire communities reliant on accessible retail services.

I have before me correspondence from the Windsor Retail Workers Union which, while sympathetic to the challenges posed by wider socioeconomic factors, insists on recognition of the toll taken on shop floor workers who often bear the brunt of repeat thefts. Their representations urge the court to impose sentences reflective of not merely pecuniary loss but attendant social harm.

The court also acknowledges the letter from the defendant's aunt, Mrs. Charlene Matthews, dated 21 August 2025, wherein she describes your upbringing as “difficult” and highlights prior involvement with social services during your adolescence. The letter expresses hope that rehabilitative interventions might address underlying vulnerabilities. While such character references are considered, the court notes this does not mitigate the culpability for present offences.

Turning to the psychological report prepared by Dr Ramachandran, it is noted that the defendant exhibits traits suggestive of mild impulse control disorder and situational depression but was found not to meet criteria for a major psychiatric diagnosis. The report highlights inconsistent engagement with voluntary support services and notes an absence of cognitive distortions frequently associated with habitual offending.

Dr Ramachandran emphasises that intervention focused on structured behavioural therapy and financial management support could ameliorate risk factors. However, the report underscores that continued offending in the absence of sustained service engagement is likely to exacerbate recidivism risk.

A brief commentary on community support frameworks is appropriate here. Agencies such as the Thames Valley Homelessness and Welfare Coalition operate under significant strain, with recent austerity measures curtailing outreach capacity. The alliance between statutory and voluntary providers, while admirable in intent, frequently falters under operational pressures. This context is not an excuse for criminal behaviour but a factor for consideration in risk assessment.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The pre-sentence report submitted by Ms Wilcox provides a comprehensive account of the defendant’s personal history, including educational attainment, employment record, and prior offending. It notes a pattern of transience in accommodation and irregular contact with family support networks. The report remarks on the absence of substance misuse issues but flags emotional volatility and the risks associated with financial hardship.

Significantly, the report recommends consideration of a community order incorporating both a rehabilitation activity requirement and unpaid work component, designed to address offending behaviour and foster civic responsibility. It is indicated that previous interventions, including a conditional discharge imposed in 2023, failed to deter reoffending.

It is the court’s view, informed by these assessments and by judicial experience, that preventive measures emphasizing accountability alongside support offer the most constructive approach to reducing future risk, provided the defendant cooperates substant
