IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/05872  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. Danvers  
Filed: 11 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence on a charge relating to offences of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. These offences occurred over a protracted period from July 2023 through to April 2025, principally within the city centre of Bristol, including a range of multiple retail establishments varying in size and nature.

Procedural History  
This case was first brought to the attention of the police following a series of incident reports made by the Bristol Retail Watch Consortium, a multi-agency body formed to coordinate responses to persistent retail theft across the city. The initial report comprised collated information from three distinct high street convenience stores, highlighting a pattern of repeated losses connected by similar modus operandi and descriptions of the suspect. A multi-disciplinary task force was established comprising officers from the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, community safety officers employed by Bristol City Council, and representatives of the Consortium itself.  

It is worth noting that the establishment of the Bristol Retail Watch Consortium in 2019 was, at the time, regarded as a progressive measure to facilitate the pooling of intelligence and resources among commercial stakeholders and local authorities. However, notwithstanding dedicated efforts, the Consortium continues to grapple with the limitations imposed by funding constraints and variable engagement levels across individual member organisations. The attendant challenges of information sharing, data protection compliance, and strategic alignment have been extensively documented in internal audits commissioned in 2022 and 2024. Such realities characterise the environment in which cases such as the present must be investigated.

In this matter, investigative procedures took significant time and effort, including several nights of covert surveillance and the deployment of uniformed and plainclothes officers into shopping precincts. Data analytics input, managed by the Avon and Somerset Digital Crime Unit, included the aggregation and analysis of multiple CCTV feeds, enhanced with facial recognition algorithms, subject to the necessary judicial authorisations. A series of identified thefts totalling fifteen incidents were used to construct a representative charge under the cumulative offence principle as upheld in R v. Bedwell [2017] EWCA Crim 462. In the early stages, the defendant exercised their right to silence during an initial police interview, though later provided a statement acknowledging presence at some retail sites.

Beyond these investigatory efforts, it is appropriate at this juncture to note the persistent difficulties faced by police forces nationally in effectively responding to the rise in 'low-level' acquisitive crime, such as shoplifting. Reports from the Home Office indicate that such offences constitute a significant proportion of recorded crime, yet attract comparatively limited investigative resources due to prioritisation of violent and organised crime. This institutional dichotomy poses real obstacles to the administration of justice and risks rendering affected individuals and communities vulnerable to ongoing harm. In Bristol, as elsewhere, the Avon and Somerset Constabulary has engaged in attempts to innovate approaches to retail crime, including 'hot spot' policing, but the impact remains inconsistent.

These remarks are made within the broader context of systemic pressures on public services, including the justice and rehabilitation sectors. There is an ever-present strain on probation services, which have seen successive reductions in staffing levels over recent years. In Avon and Somerset, the probation workload per officer now exceeds national averages as outlined in the Ministry of Justice annual report of 2024. Consequently, delays in report preparation and enhanced supervision remain challenges for courts to navigate. The same strain is evident within mental health services, where waiting times for specialist assessment—particularly in forensic contexts—often extend beyond clinically recommended intervals.

Moreover, persons accused of acquisitive offences frequently present with complex needs including unstable housing, substance misuse, and co-existing mental health disorders. Coordinated intervention—though desirable—is fraught with practical limitation. The court is frequently called upon to weigh the availability and efficacy of such supports when considering sentencing options. This is a matter not just of rehabilitation strategy but fundamental to maintaining public confidence in the justice system.

The chronology of this case reflects some of these operational realities. Initial charge was made on 14 May 2025. A plea and trial preparation hearing was listed for 3 September but adjourned to enable the defendant to instruct appropriate expert witnesses. Legal aid applications encountered a regrettable delay, the subject of correspondence between defence solicitors and the Legal Aid Agency, with funding for psychological assessment only approved after multiple enquiries over a four-week period.

Extensive efforts have been made to obtain a timely pre-sentence report from the Regional Probation Service. Despite high caseloads, report preparation was completed and submitted in recent days. The report is detailed and considers a multitude of evaluative factors germane to your risk profile, engagement history, and potential for rehabilitation.

It is essential to recognise that the charge before this court represents a representative sample of the offending behaviour attributed to you, Mr H, rather than discrete offences brought in isolation. The approach taken aligns with Crown Prosecution Service guidance on the management of serial acquisitive crime and reflects a balance between evidential sufficiency and procedural economy.  

Turning briefly to relevant case law, the Court recalls the principles articulated in R v. Simmons [2015] EWCA Crim 1234, which upheld the use of representative counts in circumstances where the number of alleged offences is substantial and the conduct consistent, with the proviso that the court must consider the full course of conduct when determining sentence. This approach ensures that the abstract value of stolen goods is set aside in favour of assessing the overall impact, persistence, and risk posed by the defendant.

Additionally, it is appropriate to reflect on the observations in R v. Drummond [2020] EWCA Crim 908, concerning the role of previous interventions in sentencing. There, the Court emphasised that breach of prior community orders and failure to desist weigh heavily in favour of custodial sentences in persistent offending cases.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Let me briefly digress on a topic of procedural interest that, although unrelated to this charge specifically, has had some tangential bearing on court operations in this jurisdiction. Over the summer months, the Bristol Combined Courts complex underwent significant refurbishment including the upgrade of courtroom technology, the installation of improved digital recording equipment, and enhancements to witness waiting areas. Whilst welcome in principle, this work contributed to a degree of scheduling congestion and the necessity to relocate several trials, including some involving co-defendants associated with theft prosecutions in adjacent circuits.

While not germane to your case directly, Mr H, it is illustrative of the fluctuating challenges faced by the justice system in maintaining accessible and effective service delivery. These infrastructural matters add layers of complexity to case management beyond the substantive issues.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Also worthy of note is a recent report issued by the Bristol Criminal Justice Board, which highlighted the complexities of managing cases involving co-defendants, particularly in contexts where one party absconds or delays proceedings. The report commended the proactive use of section 37 Mental Health Act assessments in co-defendant scenarios, though it underlined the ongoing prevalence of late disclosures and their disruptive effect on trial preparation. Whilst no such issues have arisen here with yourself, adjacent cases have encountered difficulty due to defendants’ engagement with mental health services.

Indeed, mental health considerations have increasingly featured in the sentencing landscape for acquisitive offences. In R v. Quist [2021] EWCA Crim 1102, the Court acknowledged that where mental disorder is present but does not diminish responsibility, community-based interventions might be possible, subject to rigorous risk management. Nonetheless, the paramount consideration remains public protection.

Dr Jane Melling, Consultant Psychiatrist at Avon Mental Health Trust, provided an expert opinion following your examination in August this year. Dr Melling's report noted that while significant features of impulse control disorder and episodes of psychological distress were evident, there was no formal diagnosis of a major psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder. It was reported that your engagement with mental health services had been sporadic but that you were, at present, open to therapeutic support.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Alongside those clinical concerns, the probation report detailed your background, noting periods of unstable accommodation interspersed with brief stays in supported housing. Your educational history included attendance at local comprehensive schools, with no formal qualifications recorded. Employment history was sporadic, limited largely to casual labour. Family relationships were described as strained, with intermittent contact with your adult siblings.

It is a sadly familiar profile, one which the court has encountered on numerous occasions in recent years. The confluence of social and personal adversity can, for some, precipitate involvement in illicit activities. Nevertheless, deprivation does not in itself excuse offending.

You have four previous convictions for dishonesty-related offences, all for shoplifting, the earliest dating back to 2017. On at least two occasions, community orders or warnings were imposed. Previous engagement with probation services exhibited a pattern of incomplete compliance and early termination. Such a history weighs heavily in the sentencing exercise, indicative of a disregard for prior intervention intended to divert you from further criminality.

The court is cognisant of the difficulties imposed by the ongoing national shortage of housing, particularly for vulnerable adults. The waiting list for supported accommodation in Bristol has extended in recent months beyond six months, a figure that represents a critical challenge both to social services and justice agencies. Mr H, it is clear that your precarious living situation contributes to instability, yet no direct link between accommodation difficulties and the incidence of this offending pattern is established on the evidence.

Submissions on Sentencing  
Crown counsel, Ms Naomi Clarke, presented her case emphasizing the cumulative impact of your offending on local businesses, the disruption to staff wellbeing, and the erosion of community trust. The Crown respectfully invited the court to impose a custodial sentence, noting the persistence of theft despite earlier diversion opportunities and the limited mitigating factors. The prosecution also drew attention to the well-established principle in sentencing that repeated offending involving similar circumstances attracts an enhanced level of seriousness, as affirmed in R v. Lockhart [2018] EWCA Crim 521.

Mr Daniel Ford, appearing for the defence, advanced submissions highlighting your guilty plea and indicated that you have expressed genuine remorse. He pointed to your engagement with proposed rehabilitation programmes, including willingness to participate in cognitive behavioural therapy and skills development courses. Mr Ford urged caution against immediate custody, advocating for a community order with a requirement for unpaid work alongside specialist support aimed at addressing underlying impulsivity and economic instability.

He further noted the recent efforts of the local food bank and housing charity, Bristol Direct Help, which have provided you with assistance. Letters from these bodies were submitted to the court and were noted for their measured tone, acknowledging challenges while affirming your commitment to engage positively.

The sentencing framework applicable is that set out in the Sentencing Council Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2019). This emphasises an assessment of culpability and harm, with appropriate consideration given to the nature of the property stolen, the method of offending, the impact on victims, and any aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

Relevance of early guilty plea credit and the necessity of proportionality in passing sentence will be applied with reference to established authority, including R v. Robinson [2020] EWCA Crim 1593.

The court also recalls previous remarks in cases such as R v. Sartorius [2022] EWCA Crim 1345, where custodial sentences for acquisitive offending were upheld in the context of repeated breaches of community orders and persistent targeting of small independent retailers.

Notwithstanding these precedents, it remains the case that every defendant is sentenced on the totality of individual circumstances, including personal background, mental health considerations, and prospects for rehabilitation.

The court acknowledges with appreciation the cooperation of Ms Chloe Morgan, probation officer, and Dr Jane Melling, Consultant Psychiatrist, in submitting timely and comprehensive reports to facilitate sentencing.

It is a matter of ongoing concern that resourcing constraints within the probation and mental health services restrict timely and effective access to interventions. The court hopes that systemic efforts to redress these shortages will bear fruit, benefiting defendants, victims, and communities alike.

The matter will now adjourn for a short period pending receipt of any further representations from the defence, final observations from the prosecution, and to allow for consideration of the pre-sentence report and psychiatric evidence in finalising the appropriate sentence.
