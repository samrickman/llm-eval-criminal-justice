IN THE CROWN COURT AT RIVERSIDE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14421  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge C. J. ELLINGTON  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced in respect of charges arising from a course of conduct involving theft from retail premises, namely shoplifting, in breach of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The conduct charged occurred over a period spanning approximately eighteen months, with occurrences across multiple retail establishments within the Riverside and adjacent boroughs.

Procedural Overview  
Your case commenced upon police arrest on 19 June 2025, following an extended investigatory phase orchestrated by the Riverside Local Policing Team and the Retail Abuse Liaison Unit. This investigation was precipitated by rising reports from various independent and chain stores noting a pattern of recurrent evasions of payment involving a suspect fitting your description. The inter-agency coordination included not only local police officers but also civilian crime prevention advisors and a network of security personnel working under the auspices of the Riverside Business Crime Partnership.

Cases of repeated retail theft, while sometimes regarded as minor, impose a disproportionate demand on public agencies and commercial stakeholders alike. Police leadership continues to voice concern about the sustained diversion of frontline resources toward acquisitive crime, which detracts from capacity to pursue more grievous offences, including those involving violence or exploitation. Just last month, the Chief Constable publicly acknowledged that theft offences now form nearly 40% of policing workload in these areas, contributing to operational strain and heightened community unease.

You were initially interviewed under caution on 25 June 2025. At that juncture, you denied involvement. Nevertheless, forensic analysis of garments seized at the time of your arrest revealed contact traces consistent with items absent from the stores. High-definition CCTV footage from multiple incidents directly places a person matching your description at the scenes of theft. These evidential components culminated in the formal charge that instigated your prosecution in this forum.

Against this factual and procedural backdrop, the court is mindful of the enduring tensions inherent in managing persistent lower-level offending. The criminal justice system must balance the imperative of public protection and deterrence with the need to avoid disproportionate punishment, particularly where underlying vulnerabilities may be present or mitigation warranted.

It is also incumbent on the court to recognise the ongoing enhancements to prosecutorial frameworks since the integration of Better Case Management (BCM) protocols in 2019. These reforms, intended to shorten the lifecycle of cases and improve evidential clarity, have faced implementation challenges but have borne some incremental benefits here. In this matter, hearings proceeded more or less in keeping with the indicative timescales set out in the Criminal Procedure Rules, notwithstanding an adjournment on 3 September 2025 occasioned by late disclosure and a pending application to instruct a forensic clinical psychologist — itself delayed pending Legal Aid authorisation.

It is regrettable, though not wholly unexpected, that such administrative hurdles continue to impede expeditious justice. Legal Aid applications in cases involving acquittal or community disposal options often face protracted review, as was the experience here. The court reiterates longstanding concerns about the protracted wait times for professional expert input, especially in cases where psychiatric or psychological assessments bear significantly on sentencing options and risk stratification.

While the public revenue expended on investigations of persistent shoplifting may be regarded as disproportionate, there is, undeniably, a threshold beyond which repetitive acquisitive offending evolves from a mere nuisance to a systemic destabiliser. That the Retail Support Network—an embryonic voluntary-sector alliance—has strained to assist independently affected businesses highlights the cross-sectoral impact of these offending patterns. They have submitted impactful representations corroborating the emotional and financial toll inflicted upon proprietors and staff, including reduced staffing levels, increased surveillance investment, and the erosion of personal security confidence.  

It would be remiss not to mention contemporaneous pressures on housing and social support services within Riverside. The growing incidence of rough sleeping—now at statistically record highs—exacerbates community disorder and intersects with patterns of acquisitive crime, though causation is complex and multifactorial. Local crisis teams report that service demand often outstrips capacity, hampering sustained engagement. It is in this fraught social environment that offending such as yours unfolds. While context cannot excuse behaviour, it shapes understanding and informs sentencing discretion.

In parallel, the court notes the current unavailability of Drug and Alcohol Treatment Programmes within the region until at least mid-2026, owing to resource constraints. This might be pertinent to your case, as you have disclosed occasional previous substance use, though that remains unassessed clinically.

Turning to legal principle, it bears repeating the firm approach to credit for guilty pleas espoused in recent appellate jurisprudence such as R v. Sanderson [2024] EWCA Crim 476. There, the Court emphasised that timing is of the essence, and credit diminishes markedly where pleas are delayed until the cusp of trial despite early disclosure and readiness. Late pleas, while welcomed, do not convey the same procedural efficiency or remorse.

Parallel guidance arises from R v. Golding [2023] EWCA Crim 1109, where theft involving prolonged deception and multiple incidents attracted a custodial threshold, particularly where the impact on vulnerable retail staff was compounded by the absence of any proactive remedial effort.

Similarly, in R v. Anderton [2020] EWCA Crim 2704, the Court addressed the cumulative public harm engendered by targeted thefts of pharmaceutical products. Although unrelated to your charges, that case underscores the seriousness with which repetitive acquisitive offending is regarded, especially where it threatens essential supply chain integrity.

Finally, reference may be made to R v. O’Connell [2019] EWCA Crim 1438, which, albeit involving vehicular drug offences, reinforces the principle that culpability assessment must consider persistent offending together with personal circumstances.

The facts establish a clear pattern across multiple retail sites, reflecting premeditation and familiarity with store routines. Evidence confirms your use of concealment tactics and calculated misdirection, often during busy periods, exploiting staff attention elsewhere. Security responses were repeatedly frustrated by these tactics, necessitating costly countermeasures.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

In addition to the physical concealment of items, the thefts involved tampering with electronic anti-theft tags, demonstrating planning beyond opportunistic grabbing. One recorded episode captured you entering a retail outlet wearing a baseball cap and layered clothing to impede clear identification. The offences were characterised by a troubling persistence that followed prior warnings and intervention attempts.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

There is little in the way of physical violence here; no overt threat or use of force was recorded. However, staff testimony reveals increased stress, anxiety, and, in some cases, employee turnover, attributable directly to the impact of repeated offending. The human cost extends beyond the immediate item loss to psychological effects, something this court must weigh in its assessment.

Offsetting factors become evident in the reports appended to this file, in particular the detailed Probation Service Pre-Sentence Report compiled by Officer Laura Miles. The report reflects a complex interplay of factors including unstable accommodation, a transient family environment, and sporadic engagement with social services. Medical assessments, including that performed by Dr Stephen Kaufman, a forensic psychiatrist, identify traits of impulsivity and mild mood disorder, though fall short of a formal psychiatric diagnosis.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Dr Kaufman’s report includes a consideration of your mental health history, noting that while you have no recorded episodes of psychosis or severe mood disorder, you exhibit features consistent with mild adult attention deficit disorder and intermittent depressive symptoms. These findings are assessed as bearing marginally on culpability but raising questions regarding your potential responsiveness to structured community interventions.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

It is worth remarking that during the course of this matter the court received correspondence from your elder sister, Mrs Helen H., outlining familial concern and offering support, albeit qualified. Additional letters from CrisisAid Centre personnel attest to your limited but ongoing engagement with front-line housing support. These documents underscore some degree of social stability, though arguably insufficient to mitigate risk of reoffending conclusively.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Your offending record indicates prior convictions for dishonesty offences dating back several years; notably, a theft offence from 2021 for which you received a community order. That order included requirements for unpaid work and attendance on an assault reduction workshop, which you completed partially but reportedly ceased engagement prematurely. These prior patterns bear relevance to the assessment of your risk and culpability.

The Crown’s closing submissions emphasised the aggravating features of your persistent offending and the broader societal impact of retail theft. They highlighted the financial losses incurred, the distress caused to employees, and the erosion of public confidence in shopping environments. The prosecution acknowledged your guilty pleas, but contended that credit should be limited on general principles.

The Defence made representations regarding your challenging social circumstances, advocated for recognition of remorse demonstrated by your admission, and proposed that community-based rehabilitation, combined with tailored psychological support, might present a viable pathway to reform.

A relevant recent development in sentencing jurisprudence was explored: the Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Clarke [2025] EWCA Crim 157, which refined guidance on the interplay between custodial sentences and the availability of supported housing. Clarke echoed earlier decisions in stressing that lack of stable accommodation does not excuse offending but that courts should balance custodial severity against risk of precipitous homelessness.

It is important to underscore the operational context within which this court hears cases such as this one. Since the closure of the Riverside Magistrates’ Court in 2023 as part of the rationalisation of court estates, Crown Court listings have faced increasingly acute pressure. Adjournments and listing constraints, sometimes exacerbated by strike action amongst legal professionals or administrative staff, have lengthened case lifecycles, imposing additional strain on defendants, victims, and practitioners.

Multi-agency engagement with vulnerable offenders remains hampered by persistent workforce shortages, especially within probation and social service teams. While case management protocols, including Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), apply principally to higher-risk offenders, the boundaries often blur where repeated acquisitive crime intersects with mental health and homelessness.

It is also germane to mention that certain co-defendants linked to associated investigations stood accused of offences unrelated to your case—specifically, one individual previously charged with fly-tipping in a protected greenbelt area and another facing allegations of assault with a bladed article in a school zone. These charges have no bearing on your conduct and will be considered separately.

The court is mindful that jurisprudential reflections on offences involving dangerous driving and aggravated burglary, such as R v. Morgan [2018] EWCA Crim 212, highlight the necessity of differentiated sentencing calibrated carefully to offence and offender. The comparisons serve solely as a framework rather than direct precedent.

Similarly, a recent unrelated case involving arson at a commercial storage facility—R v. Daniels [2025] EWCA Crim 230—has drawn judicial commentary on the importance of judicial consistency while recognising contextual variance. That case remains distinct and unrelated to the facts before this court today.

Your counsel’s applications for expert assessments included requests for reports from clinical psychologists specialising in impulsivity and risk management. Due to delays in Legal Aid authorisation, these reports were received only shortly before today’s hearing, limiting their impact on planning but nonetheless serving to highlight intervention opportunities.

Following the general principle that credit is awarded commensurate with the timeliness of guilty pleas as provided in the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft, you receive modest mitigation on this factor.

The court acknowledges your expressed willingness to engage with community rehabilitation services and recognises the efforts of Riverside Support Network, which continues to offer precarious but invaluable assistance. Their demand, however, outstrips capacity, and waiting lists have lengthened in recent months.

It is regrettable that issues such as local delays in mental health service provision, staffing shortages in probation and social housing teams, and bureaucratic impediments in Legal Aid processing hamper holistic offender management, risking recidivism and public harm.

That said, the court must remind itself that support and systemic factors, while salient, cannot obscure the reality that repeated dishonesty undermines social trust, causes tangible financial loss, and impacts vulnerable workers.

There was no recorded instance or allegation of weapon possession or coercive behaviour by you; these factors being significant aggravators in other cases, such as R v. Calderwood [2022] EWCA Cr
