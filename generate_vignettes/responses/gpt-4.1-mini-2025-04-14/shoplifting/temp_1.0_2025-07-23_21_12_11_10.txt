IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/04157  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. L. CAVENDISH  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction upon your plea of guilty for offences of theft by shoplifting under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences were committed over a period extending from the autumn of 2023 through early 2025 and involve multiple retail premises within the city centre and neighbouring suburbs.

Procedural Background and Administrative Observations  
Initially charged in February 2025, your case was listed before the Crown Court at Bristol for a plea and trial preparation hearing under the aegis of the Better Case Management (BCM) arrangements. The BCM framework, introduced in its current form in 2013 and gradually refined, aims to promote early case resolution by means of timely identification of issues and evidence, thereby reducing the court system's chronic backlog. Your matter proceeded through a series of case progression hearings that were, on the whole, reasonably well conducted, though not without the customary adjournments occasioned by Legal Aid funding applications, which involved protracted correspondence between defence solicitors and the Legal Aid Agency. These delays, while frustrating to all parties, reflect entrenched bureaucratic complexities afflicting the provision of publicly funded criminal defence in England and Wales.

It is necessary to pause here and note the continued pressures on publicly funded legal representation frameworks, which do not disserve this case alone but are emblematic of systemic strains. Requests for expert assessments — whether psychiatric, psychological, or forensic — routinely encounter procedural obstacles attributable to funding authorisation processes, which introduce avoidable dilations in pre-trial preparation. This court records its ongoing, though frequently voiced, concern about the negative ramifications of such impediments for defendants’ rights and the efficient administration of justice.

At no point did these issues, however, derail the effective assemblage of the prosecution case or prevent the court from progressing this matter toward resolution. I am grateful to the prosecution, led by Ms Eileen Marlowe, for her diligent and measured conduct throughout, and to defence counsel, Mr Rory Thornton, who appear under a Legal Aid representation order, for their professional engagement notwithstanding the limitations imposed by resource constraints.

The Crown’s case was supported by evidential materials including CCTV footage, point-of-sale records, and statements from multiple store employees, alongside corroborative forensic analysis of recovered property. The forensic examination section within the City Police Digital Unit, dealing with the triage and enhancement of video footage, continues to face significant case load pressures, a circumstance indicative of the rising demand for digital forensic work nationally. This demand encompasses not merely criminal investigations but also the wider public sector interface with cybersecurity matters.

Further background to the investigatory apparatus can be profiled. The investigation into your offending arose from reports collated by the Bristol Retail Security Consortium, a collaboration of local business proprietors, municipal police intelligence units, and community safety officers. In this respect, the chapter closed on an instance of effective multi-agency cooperation, notwithstanding the well-documented administrative burdens such collaboration can impose. The interplay among the various bodies often involves complex information-sharing agreements, data protection considerations, and coordination meetings known colloquially as “tasking groups,” which aim to prioritise resources. Such arrangements frequently require extensive logistical support and documentation, consuming officer hours away from frontline engagement.

With regard to your personal background, the probation service has prepared a comprehensive pre-sentence assessment which outlines relevant elements of your history, social circumstances, and risk factors. I will return to this material shortly.

The Criminal Justice Landscape and Sentencing Context  
The offences before the court are not isolated incidents but part of a course of conduct consistent with repeat acquisitive offending. This court is aware that low-level thefts, particularly those from retail premises, represent a considerable proportion of workload in magistrates’ courts and Crown Courts alike. While the financial value of individual incidents may be modest, their cumulative societal costs, including to small business viability and staff wellbeing, are palpable.

The sentencing framework generated by the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline (published 2019) provides the starting point for determination of appropriate sanctions. Theft offences are graded according to culpability and harm, with the latter encompassing both economic and psychological impact on victims and wider community considerations such as deterring similar conduct.

The guideline acknowledges that offences against small independent retailers, pharmacies, and community interests may warrant greater weight given the disproportionate effect on these entities. The Court of Appeal has stressed on multiple occasions the importance of considering the broader public interest, including in R v. Hines [2020] EWCA Crim 1057 and R v. Griffiths [2022] EWCA Crim 601, relating respectively to persistent shop theft and use of distraction tactics.

It is instructive to recall, in passing, the decision in R v. Calvert [2018] EWCA Crim 1984, involving acquisitive offending with elements of organised activity, which emphasised that monetary value is not the sole yardstick. Psychological harm and community impact may elevate seriousness to a degree commensurate with higher culpability.

A review of recent appellate authority also invites cautious reflection on credit for guilty pleas, in line with principles laid down in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029 and R v. McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145. The timing and quality of admissions are critical for determining mitigation, designed to incentivise early acceptance of responsibility and relieve pressure on witnesses and the court system.

This is not to discount the statutory constraints and procedural fairness that insist on trials where evidential disputes arise; however, the courts’ collective attention remains fixed on promptness and candour.

Victim and Community Impact  
The court has received representations from the Bristol Retailers Association and several individual store managers, articulating the palpable consequences of persistent retail theft: staffing pressures, security cost inflations, and the psychological strain borne by frontline workers. While no bodily injuries or threats of violence were directly perpetrated by you, the emotional effects — including increased anxiety and fear of repeat victimisation — merit full consideration.

Notably, several premises reported adapting working practices as a direct consequence: increased reliance on CCTV monitoring, introduction of security tags, and rearranged staff shift patterns. An unfortunate corollary has been reduced hours for some employees, negatively affecting household incomes.

The voluntary sector has also provided commentary on this case. A letter submitted by the Bristol Community Outreach Trust, which offers support to individuals at risk of homelessness and entrenchment in acquisitive crime patterns, underscored multifaceted social factors influencing offending behaviour in the city. The charity stressed the importance of context-specific intervention and cautioned against an exclusively punitive approach that disregards rehabilitation potential.

Similar advocacy comes from the Bristol Hope Project, a solicitor-led clinic specializing in mental health and criminal justice intersections, which supplied observation on the critical importance of mental well-being supports in curbing recidivism. They noted that while comprehensive services exist, access and engagement remain inconsistent.

It must be noted, however, that these well-intentioned initiatives operate under considerable resource strain. Increasing wait times for assessment by NHS psychiatric services and local authority housing support illustrate systemic challenges that constrain the options available to defendants and sentencing courts alike. The NHS England waiting list for adult psychiatric assessment currently exceeds 16 weeks, a delay that is a burgeoning concern in judicial and clinical circles.

A brief recount of unrelated but illustrative case history serves here. In 2019, the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence in R v. Chambers [2019] EWCA Crim 1564 for repeated retail theft accompanied by aggressive obstructive behaviour toward staff. The sentencing remarks highlighted the importance of proportionality, victim impact, and the necessity of deterrence within habitual offending paradigms.

I further note with interest that the trial listings in Bristol Crown Court have been subject to intermittent disruption this year due to necessary refurbishment works to the court’s digital infrastructure, as well as periodic judicial strike action affecting several weeks in May and June. These scheduling pressures, though external to the merits of any individual case, nonetheless compound the systemic complexity of timely justice delivery.

Your Personal and Psychiatric Background  
Turning to your own history, you were born in the early 1980s and are presently 42 years old. You have a prior criminal record predominantly comprising acquisitive offences, including three previous convictions for shoplifting from 2012 to 2021. You have also received a community order in 2020 involving unpaid work. There is no indication of violent or sexual offending in your past.

The probation assessment conveys your current residence as supported housing provided by the Bristol City Council’s Housing Stability Programme. You report a history of unstable tenancy and intermittent unemployment, which together have contributed to financial difficulty. While acknowledging these factors, you have reportedly declined several offers of assistance related to debt management and skills training. Such non-engagement is regrettable and undermines rehabilitation efforts.

Dr Samantha Fielding, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided an independent evaluation pursuant to the defence’s instruction. Her report, dated 29 August 2025, finds no evidence of major psychiatric illness such as psychosis or bipolar disorder but does identify traits of mild depressive disorder combined with features of impulsivity and borderline personality traits. Dr Fielding observed that these characteristics may contribute to difficulties in long-term planning and impulse control but did not attribute your offending to any significant cognitive impairment or diminished responsibility.

The report further noted a history of non-compliance with prescribed medication and sporadic attendance at mental health outpatient clinics, which are under considerable strain due to overall resource limitations. The recommendation was for a structured community-based intervention combining cognitive behavioural therapy addressing impulsive conduct and engagement with social support services.

Mental health liaison services within the National Health Service in the Bristol area function under intense operational pressure. The dual challenges of underfunding and rising demand have lengthened waiting times and impeded patient continuity. The court is conscious of how these institutional limitations may affect offenders’ access to treatment but cannot countenance non-engagement when opportunities are available.

The Facts of Offending  
The facts may be summarised as follows.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

On several occasions, you were observed by retail staff engaging in concealment of goods, predominantly over-the-counter medications and toiletries, within clothing or bags. Your repeated visits to the same premises on days when staffing was known to be reduced suggest a planned and opportunistic approach.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

You took steps to evade capture, including changing outer garments and moving rapidly away once confronted. Incident reports include instances in which alarm sensors were triggered but consequently deactivated by yourself or your accomplice on different occasions.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Staff reported feelings of unease and anxiety following these events, with at least one individual requesting redeployment to a less visible role. It is the court’s view that while no physical violence was directed at any victim, the psychological impact, when aggregated, is of significant import.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

It should be noted that your conduct is not consistent with an isolated lapse or momentary weakness. Rather, it denotes repeated decision-making in the face of prior warnings and informal interventions by crime prevention officers.

Further Legal Considerations and Sentencing Factors  
Notwithstanding the repeated nature of the offending, the absence of prior custodial sentences remains relevant. The court must balance the need for deterrence with proportionality, mindful that immediate custody is generally reserved for cases representing serious harm or high levels of culpability.

The Sentencing Council guidance stresses that while the theft of low-value items may attract lower starting points, aggravating factors such as persistence, targeting vulnerable staff, and failure to desist after warnings raise culpability.

Mitigating considerations include your guilty plea, albeit entered after the full presentation of evidence, your expressed commitment to engage with support services, and the absence of evidence that the offences involved any violence or threats.

Given the complexities noted, the court will direct the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report evaluating the feasibility of a community order encompassing requirements for rehabilitation, unpaid work, and mental health treatment.

Though the court acknowledges systemic delays affecting support services, it expects defendants to assiduously engage with available assistance. Failure to do so undermines the credibility of submitted mitigation.

The case once again draws attention to a larger societal context: the continued rise in street homelessness and begging, the economic precariousness afflicting many urban dwellers, and the persistence of mental health conditions in the community. Such factors intersect with offending patterns with increasing frequency, placing considerable strain on criminal justice, social services, and health providers. Yet, it remains incumbent upon individuals to take responsibility for choices and engage positively with help proffered.

The sorry zeitgeist marked by chronic under-resourcing and fractured service delivery is not a shield against criminal liability.

Lastly, the court acknowledges the considerable and ongoing work of organisations such as the Bristol Retail Support Network and the South West Probation Service, both operating under immense strain, whose correspondence has been helpful in informing this sentencing process.

Note is also made of previous irrelevant incidents involving co-defendants who are not before the court; I emphasise that such matters are not germane to the sentencing of Mr H. Similarly, prior unrelated offences against public transport infrastructure, or criminal environmental violations committed by other parties, have no bearing here.

The sentencing hearing has been held in open court. I record my thanks to all officers, legal representatives, court clerks, and ushers whose professionalism ensured an orderly and respectful process.

Conclusion and Directions  
I reserve final sentencing until receipt of the updated pre-sentence report from the probation service and any supplementary representations from the defence or prosecution.

This report should address the viability of community-based interventions tailored to your needs, and provide an assessment of risk to the public and likelihood of reoffending.
