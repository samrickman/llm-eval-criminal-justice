IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/13574  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. C. HOLLAND  
Filed: 19 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for theft from retail premises under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences, as charged and proven, encompass a series of shoplifting incidents occurring intermittently over a period extending from mid-2023 through to early 2025 within the Brighton and Hove area. It is a matter of public record that the cumulative impact of such offending, often dismissed as trivial by some, carries significant implications for victims, community confidence, and the allocation of law enforcement resources.

Procedural Overview  
Following your arrest on 29 March 2025 by officers from Sussex Police’s Business Crime Unit, you were initially interviewed at Hove Police Station, during which you declined to make substantive comment. The ensuing investigation was notable for the notable collaboration between trading standards officers, local store security teams, and the Sussex Police digital forensics department, reflecting a multi-agency commitment to tackling persistent retail theft. This court takes note of the diligence of all parties, particularly in an operational environment often challenged by competing demands and limited resources.

It is a regrettable but established reality that cases of this sort frequently encounter delays attributable to procedural and administrative complexities. For example, in your matter, the court observed a succession of adjournments precipitated by late disclosure from third-party retailers and delays in authorisation of psychiatric and psychological assessments through the Legal Aid Agency. Such procedural points, while understandable in context, emphasize systemic issues that continue to hamper timely justice and impose additional strain on all participants.  

The case was transferred from the magistrates’ court to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative introduced to enhance efficiency in prosecutions involving complex or multiple offending. While the framework aims to expedite, it often highlights the inherent challenges in coordinating evidence collation and multi-agency liaison. Indeed, the BCM hearing took place on 17 June 2025, with subsequent preparation hearings ensuring all material necessary for trial and sentencing was duly served and considered.

The court is appreciative of the representative efforts of the prosecution counsel, Ms Helen Faraday of counsel, whose thorough submissions have consistently sought to balance acknowledgement of mitigating factors against the clear need for deterrence. Likewise, Mr Daniel Knox, counsel for the defence, has maintained a professional and conscientious approach throughout, prompting, where appropriate, adjourning to enable the preparation of – inter alia – up-to-date medical reports and character references.

In passing, I remark upon a phenomenon increasingly noted within courts dealing with acquisitive crime: the frequency with which guilty pleas are entered at a late stage, often immediately before trial commences. While the defendant’s decision to admit guilt must be respected, there is a growing recognition, established in R v Samuelson [2022] EWCA Crim 1890, that the timing of a plea is a critical factor influencing the extent of sentencing credit. Pleas made after the prosecution's case is unassailable attract significantly reduced mitigation, a point this court will bear in mind.

Public and Institutional Context  
Retail thefts of this nature exert a disproportionate cumulative pressure on the policing system, retail businesses, and community safety. The Business Crime Reduction Partnership model operating within Sussex represents a concerted effort to streamline intelligence sharing and response coordination. However, the court remains acutely aware of the limits of such partnerships, particularly where human factors such as staff turnover, administrative delays, and shifting priorities undermine operational continuity. The capacity constraints of the Safer Neighbourhoods Teams — buoyed though they remain by dedicated officers — continue to complicate the maintenance of consistent surveillance and victim support.

The Retail Support and Recovery Network, a charitable organisation working in this locale, has issued written representations detailing the frequent need to assist employees subjected to repeated theft, emphasizing the emotional toll and erosion of trust such conduct precipitates. Equally, the precarious financial position of many small traders in Brighton — exacerbated in recent years by rising commercial rents and constrained footfall — is a matter of record. They are compelled, in many cases, to install costly security measures or face untenable loss. These considerations, while external to your individual culpability, form part of the wider landscape in which your offences must be assessed.

As this court has noted in numerous sentencing remarks, the prevailing social environment is one marked by what might be described as the 'normalisation' of low-level acquisitive offending. The prevalence of online resale platforms and informal supply chains facilitates the rapid monetisation of stolen goods, further complicating intervention efforts. Against this backdrop, the need for proportionate but firm judicial response is underscored.

Concomitantly, the court acknowledges that systemic deficiencies in accessing mental health treatment, housing support, and employment opportunities exacerbate personal vulnerabilities that may underpin such offending. Yet, the availability of such support does not equate to an unfettered exemption from responsibility. The law balances mitigation against the inexorable requirement to protect the public interest and uphold trust in justice.

We are presented, in the present case, with a narrative complicated by these intersecting factors — a defendant whose background and circumstances demand careful consideration, yet who stands accountable for actions that have undermined public confidence and caused genuine distress.

Legal Framework  
The relevant offence is theft as defined by s1 of the Theft Act 1968, requiring dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner. The Theft Offences Sentencing Guideline, last updated in 2023, provides a comprehensive framework for considering harm, culpability, and aggravating or mitigating features.

Whilst the statutory framework is clear, the case law offers instructive guidance. In R v. Preston [2019] EWCA Crim 1548, the Court reiterated that repeat offending renders general deterrence a prominent sentencing consideration. The sentencing judge must also give appropriate weight to the personal circumstances of the offender and the risk of reoffending.

Case law relating to mental health and addiction issues is also pertinent here. In R v. Fisher [2021] EWCA Crim 1127, the Court acknowledged the mitigating impact of untreated substance dependency but affirmed that, without demonstrated engagement in treatment, custodial sentences remain justified where offending is persistent. This reinforces the importance of personal agency in the rehabilitation process.

Turning to the particular facets of guilty plea credit, I remind the parties of the principles articulated in R v. Dunnett [2020] EWCA Crim 367, which clarify that credit is discretionary and governed by the timing and sincerity of the plea, with diminished reductions for pleas offered late in the proceedings. The service of victim impact statements, often overlooked in shoplifting cases, is a relevant aggravatory factor, capturing the broader psychosocial harm caused.

It is worth noting that some appellate decisions in related but distinct contexts highlight additional aggravating features unrelated here. For example, in R v. Coleman [2020] EWCA Crim 2202, a burglary case involving a firearm, the sentences reflected grievous physical dangers absent in your case. Similarly, R v. Oldridge [2018] EWCA Crim 1745, concerning environmental offences, underscores that unlawfully stored hazardous waste can lead to severe custodial terms even when public exposure is limited. While these judgments do not directly inform sentencing here, their presence in the legal corpus exemplifies the range of harm considerations courts evaluate.

Investigative and Victim Considerations  
On 4 April 2025, your arrest was the outcome of a coordinated operation involving not only Sussex Police but also the Digital Crime Unit of the National Crime Agency, reflecting the increasingly sophisticated nexus between traditional retail theft and technologies enabling resale and concealment of evidence. The operational deployment of covert CCTV and the subsequent meticulous analysis of transaction timestamp data were resource-intensive, absorbing personnel who might otherwise have been engaged in higher-priority investigations.

The court further notes the valuable contributions of victims, including statements from several independent shopkeepers who have suffered repeated losses and associated distress. One senior manager described feeling “constantly anxious” during and after your known episodes at their premises, compelling changes to staff rotas and an increased reliance on security personnel. These measures bear ongoing costs and attest to the real-world consequences of your conduct beyond mere financial deprivation.

It is important to emphasise that your offending was not confined to a single venue or a brief time span. Instead, patterns of conduct point to a deliberate engagement with opportunities arising from inadequate staff coverage and store layout vulnerabilities. This court has, over many years, recognised such modus operandi as an aggravatory feature — indicia of premeditation and calculated risk-taking.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

Despite the absence of violence or threats, the cumulative impact on victims and their employees is not negligible. In fact, experts in retail crime reduction caution that persistent thefts contribute to staff fatigue, burnout, and turnover, amplifying indirect harms to communities served.

The court is grateful to the probation service for their comprehensive pre-sentence social enquiry report prepared following a detailed interview with you and supplemented by enquiries with your social worker at Eaglesham Housing Support. The report highlights your enrollment in a local substance misuse clinic and the existence of diagnosed depressive disorder treated intermittently. These matters were corroborated in the clinical report prepared by Dr Faisal Qureshi, consultant psychiatrist, who conducted an independent assessment at the Linden Clinic on 12 August 2025.

Dr Qureshi’s report observes that your history includes episodes of low mood and anxiety, exacerbated by precarious housing and limited social support. Nonetheless, he is clear that while these challenges impact your functioning, they do not substantially impair your capacity for decision-making or diminish your legal culpability in the present circumstances.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

The report also raises concerns over your limited engagement with psychological therapies and the inconsistent use of prescribed medication. Dr Qureshi recommends a structured community treatment order with integrated substance misuse support and cognitive behavioural interventions to address impulsivity and risk awareness.

Ancillary Observations and Institutional Context  
In the course of this matter, this court has received correspondence from several agencies, including the Sussex Retailers’ Alliance and the Brighton Mental Health Outreach Service. The former emphasises the ongoing challenges in securing adequate funding for security and loss prevention staff, a situation aggravated by rising costs and diminished local authority contributions. The latter underlines the chronic under-provision of mental health services, particularly in the context of socioeconomically disadvantaged urban zones. It is a lament that such services are often stretched to breaking point, unable to meet demand.

Additionally, the court acknowledges the case was subject to administrative delay in June 2025 due to a technical fault affecting electronic evidence disclosure by the Digital Crime Unit, which required re-processing of video files. Similarly, the Legal Aid Agency’s protracted decision-making on funding defence expert instruction contributed to a three-week adjournment, highlighting systemic constraints that frustrate fairness and timeliness.

In more peripheral matters, the court notes with some curiosity social media trends impacting court proceedings generally, including the rising prevalence of real-time courtroom commentary on platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. While such commentary is not directly relevant here, it reflects shifting public engagement with criminal justice and raises intriguing questions about transparency and influence.

This trial took place in the recently refurbished Court 5 at Brighton Crown Court, with improved acoustics and accessibility measures that have been widely welcomed by litigants and staff alike. Court ushers and administrative staff are commended for their professionalism and orderly conduct throughout the proceedings.

Sentencing Considerations  
The court’s sentencing approach is governed primarily by the Theft Offences Guideline (2023) and the statutory principles set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The nature of your offending reveals medium culpability with several aggravating factors, including persistence, planning, and the effect on victims and employees. You have multiple precedent convictions for similar offences, with at least three recorded in the five years preceding the present charges.

Mitigation on your behalf includes your current personal difficulties, mental health challenges, and housing instability. The late guilty plea — entered only shortly before the scheduled trial — affords some reduction in sentence, though less substantial than would be accorded had it been made earlier in proceedings. Your expressions of remorse, as noted both in reports and during allocution, carry weight, though must be assessed in the context of previously inconsistent engagement.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Your defence team has made submissions emphasising your lack of violence or threats, your amenability to intervention, and the potential rehabilitative benefits of community punishment. They ably argued that custodial sentencing should be a measure of last resort in the absence of significant harm or public protection concerns, advocating instead for a structured supervision order incorporating mental health treatment and drug support.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

The court is mindful of the paramount importance of balancing the twin objectives of punishment and rehabilitation. Custodial sentences, while necessary in some cases, carry profound personal and social costs. The Probation Service is critical in this regard, yet suffers from chronic underfunding and staffing deficits that hamper the delivery of integrated offender management. The present case exemplifies the need for sustainable investment in community-based alternatives.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

Notwithstanding these considerations, it is incumbent on the court to impose a sentence that denounces repeated acquisitive offending, reinforces the rule of law, and provides general deterrence to others contemplating similar conduct. That the items stolen were of relatively low individual value does not diminish the seriousness with which a sustained pattern of theft must be met.

In light of the foregoing, sentencing must await the preparation of a supplementary pre-sentence report to include updated risk assessments and the feasibility of integrated community interventions, including any willingness on your part to engage fully with mental health and substance misuse services.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 19 September 2025, at Brighton Crown Court, Court 5. The hearing has been conducted in open court with proper recording under the provisions of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are reminded of the right to appeal conviction or sentence within 28 days under the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. There are no reporting restrictions engaged by section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
