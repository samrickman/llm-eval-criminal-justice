IN THE CROWN COURT AT WESTMINSTER  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. W2025/15109  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. E. Pembroke  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction for shoplifting offences, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The conduct spans a significant period between late 2023 and mid-2025 and involves multiple incidents across Westminster, Kensington, and adjacent boroughs. The charge before the court is a representative one, covering a course of offending the prosecution has identified through evidence.  

Procedural Background and Case Management  
The proceedings in this matter have unfolded over an extended period, reflecting both the procedural complexities and the efforts to ensure fairness in the administration of justice. Initially charged on 11 April 2025, you made your first appearance before the magistrates’ court on 20 April 2025, where bail was granted subject to conditions including no entry to the retail premises involved and residence at a nominated address. The matter was sent for trial at this crown court under the Better Case Management (BCM) regime, a procedural framework designed to enhance efficiency, avoid undue delay, and facilitate early resolution of contested issues.  

It is worth noting that your case was adjourned on multiple occasions during the preparatory phase, in part because defence counsel sought to obtain expert psychiatric evidence relating to your mental state and potential mitigating factors. Requests for approval of funding under the Legal Aid Agency for such expert input proved protracted. These delays resulted in adjournments on 12 June and subsequently on 29 July 2025. The court is acutely aware of the increasing challenge facing practitioners and defendants alike in obtaining timely legal aid approval. The considerable administrative burden involved in such applications is regrettable and poses a systemic challenge to efficient justice delivery.  

Your initial plea of not guilty, tendered at the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 15 May 2025, was maintained until the eve of trial. However, after review of additional material including further CCTV footage, statements from store managers, and forensic analysis of recovered property, you entered a guilty plea on 8 September 2025, shortly before the scheduled trial commencement. This pattern of late pleas in theft-related offences is a matter of repeated judicial concern, as emphasised in R v. Fairbourne [2024] EWCA Crim 887 and subsequently applied in numerous cases where the principle of timing not only affects credit but reflects on the impact to witnesses and the court system.  

The court is therefore constrained to give you only limited credit for your guilty plea, as the plea was made at a stage when the strength of the Crown’s evidence had become overwhelming, and the loss of time and resources occasioned by the initial denial is regrettable.  

Contextual Observations on Retail Crime and Public Impact  
This case, though focused on shoplifting, must be situated within a broader social and institutional framework. It is clear, from sustained consultation with local policing teams, retail partnerships, and community stakeholders, that acquisitive crime continues to exert a disproportionate toll on vulnerable businesses and employees. The Westminster Business Crime Prevention Board, in its annual report of 2024, noted a marked increase in retail theft incidents particularly targeting pharmacies, small bakeries, and convenience stores — venues which typically operate on thin profit margins and limited security resources.  

The persistence of such offending has implications beyond mere property loss; it undermines the confidence of shoppers and staff, compels alterations in working patterns to avoid lone shifts, and can prompt the closure of establishments integral to community cohesion. It cannot be overstated that offences of this nature, though often dismissed colloquially as “minor,” carry cumulative harms to the social fabric and economic health of affected areas.

It is also relevant here to consider the phenomenon, noted in recent sociological research commissioned by the Home Office (see “Patterns in Low-Level Acquisitive Crime: A 2025 Update”), that persistent shoplifting may sometimes conceal underlying issues of socioeconomic distress, addiction, or mental health vulnerability. However, differentiation must be maintained between explanation and excuse. The justice system operates on the foundational premise that while context informs response, it does not negate accountability.

Legal Framework and Sentencing Principles  
Under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, theft is defined as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft, issued in November 2021 and revised in 2023, provides direction on assessing culpability and harm across a spectrum of offences, including shoplifting.  

The court must consider aggravating factors such as prior offending, persistence, the use of deception, and the impact upon victims and the community. Although the monetary amounts involved in individual incidents may be relatively modest, the cumulative effect is dispositive. Particular regard must be paid to the emotional and business consequences to retail staff, many of whom lack formal protective measures or adequate training in such encounters.  

The Court of Appeal decision in R v. Partridge [2023] EWCA Crim 1213 is instructive. There, the sentencing principles for repeat shoplifting offenders were examined in the light of public protection and the need to express clear societal condemnation of such conduct. Partridge underscored the concept that repetition, especially following previous warnings or interventions, signifies a higher degree of culpability requiring a commensurate sentence.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The presence or absence of mental disorder is also of relevance here. In R v. Hadley [2020] EWCA Crim 1059, the Court discussed the parameters for mitigation in cases involving diagnosed psychiatric conditions. While serious mental illness may inform dispositional options, the defendant’s culpability is not negated unless capacity to understand or control conduct is demonstrably impaired. The court is advised that the probation and psychiatric reports liaised with in this case found no evidence of such impairment.

Procedural Matters Relating to Expert Evidence and Defence Submissions  
I wish to place on record my appreciation for the team handling the psychiatric evaluation in this matter. Dr Imran Chaudhry’s independent report, commissioned on 21 June 2025, was thorough and professionally presented. It concluded that while Mr H exhibits traits indicating impulsivity and mild depressive symptoms, there was no diagnosis of psychosis, personality disorder of significant severity, or cognitive impairment to diminish criminal responsibility. His recommendation for cognitive-behavioural therapy to address maladaptive decision-making processes has been noted and referred to the probation service.  

The defence has argued that these mental health features, coupled with unstable housing and employment difficulties, mitigate your culpability. Such factors must indeed be weighed sympathetically, albeit cautiously, insofar as they may explain behavior without excusing it. Multiple letters of support were provided, including correspondence from ShelterAid and the Westminster Homeless Outreach Project, both expressing willingness to engage you in assistance programmes post-sentence subject to your cooperation.  

I am also mindful of the supply constraints and waiting lists affecting NHS psychological therapy services, a matter of growing concern across urban centres. Many defendants, including yourself, face the double burden of clinical need and systemic deficiency. Nonetheless, sentencing must reflect the offender’s conduct and risk, not unmet service availability.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Victim Impact and Community Statements  
Victim impact statements submitted by retail proprietors and employees describe the lasting effects of your offending. One shop manager remarked on the “persistent sense of unease” among staff, manifesting in changes to rostering, increased security expenditures, and a palpable erosion of morale. Another employee reported heightened anxiety and moments of panic triggered by your repeated visits, even after warnings to desist.  

The Westminster Retail Support Coalition, in their submission dated 3 September 2025, emphasised the economic ripple effects of theft-related losses frequently absorbed unwittingly by small businesses. Such losses impact local employment, jeopardise supplier contracts, and can precipitate premature closures, to the detriment of community accessibility and vitality.

Public Services and Multi-Agency Coordination  
In assessing the broader system response, this court notes the ongoing efforts to coordinate between policing units, community social workers, legal practitioners, and voluntary-sector bodies. The Westminster Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) has reviewed your case on two occasions, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for intervention.  

However, those convened meetings, while well-intended, have struggled to secure consistent engagement from some agencies, hampered by underfunding and demand pressures. The local probation unit, currently operating with a vacancy rate upward of 25%, faces waitlists and limited face-to-face contact opportunities, undermining rehabilitation prospects. These systemic difficulties, regrettably, fall beyond the scope of this court but shape the context in which justice and support interact.  

It is noted that you have, at times, failed to attend appointments arranged through ShelterAid and have demonstrated sporadic engagement with outreach workers. Such patterns diminish confidence in successful community-based recovery.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Precedent Cases and Comparators  
Turning to comparative authority, the Court is mindful of R v. Smallridge [2022] EWCA Crim 778, where a defendant with similar offending patterns and background was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment suspended for 18 months, with conditions including unpaid work and participation in a shoplifting reduction programme. That case also involved mild mental health difficulties, irregular engagement with support services, and victim impact statements indicating diminished staff confidence.  

In contrast, R v. Delling [2023] EWCA Crim 444, concerned an offender convicted of aggravated burglary involving violence and threats in the course of theft. The sentencing judge imposed a custodial sentence of 4 years, upheld on appeal. Although not directly analogous to the present case, Delling underscores the higher tariffs applicable to offences involving threat or assault, which are not features here.  

Furthermore, the Court recalls the case of R v. Pritchard [2019] EWCA Crim 805, where a plea entered early and cooperation contributed to a 25% credit on sentence. That approach seldom applies in cases where pleas are late and evidence firmly established in advance, as in the present matter.

The facts of the offending behaviour are as follows:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

The court acknowledges that your conduct manifests as a repeated breach of social and legal norms, carried out with an apparent degree of planning and disregard for consequences. The choice of premises, the times of day during shift changes, and the methods employed to conceal items are indicative of familiarity with offending techniques and an intention to avoid detection.  

It is pertinent here to raise the unfortunate reality that the co-defendant associated with one of the earlier offences absconded prior to trial and remains at large. While not a subject of your charge, this circumstance did contribute to delays in the final resolution of your case.  

Discussion of sentencing must also acknowledge the claimant store manager’s efforts to maintain business viability in a challenging urban retail environment, a concern echoed in reports from the Westminster Business Improvement District. The additional security measures implemented post-offending have reportedly cost several thousand pounds and are ongoing.  

Closing Observations and Directions  
Taking all matters into account—the nature and extent of the offending, your personal circumstances, the psychiatric assessment, the submissions of counsel, and the applicable law—I am persuaded that a custodial sentence is appropriate in this case. The persistence and planning demonstrated—coupled with your prior record of similar offences—point firmly in that direction. Any sentence must suitably reflect the harm done, express societal condemnation, and serve a deterrent function both specific and general.  

That said, the court is conscious of your identified vulnerabilities, the potential benefits of rehabilitative intervention, and the representations made on your behalf. These factors, while insufficient to displace custody, warrant careful consideration of sentence length and conditions to optimise the prospect of rehabilitation and to mitigate reoffending risk.  

I shall therefore direct that a pre-sentence report be prepared with urgency, incorporating relevant assessments of your mental health, housing status, employment prospects, and willingness to engage with structured offending behaviour programmes. The probation service is requested also to consider the suitability of interventions addressing impulsivity, substance misuse (if present), and financial management. The report should evaluate possible community orders with rehabilitation activity requirements, recognising that any such sentence must be proportionate and balanced against public protection imperatives.  

I note with regret the ongoing strain under which criminal justice and associated health and social services operate. Staff shortages in probation, NHS waiting lists for psychological therapies, and funding constraints on voluntary sector agencies are chronic obstacles that impact case outcomes. While these factors do not excuse offending, they represent the milieu in which justice is presently administered.  

Before concluding, I record my thanks to Ms Eliza Mendel, representing the Crown, whose submissions were measured and carefully reasoned. My thanks are also due to Mr Julian Spencer on your behalf, for his diligent advocacy notwithstanding the constraints posed by the adjournments and evidence complexities. The court also acknowledges the courtroom staff, whose professionalism and courtesy, even amid last-minute procedural adjustments, maintained the dignity of the proceedings.  

Finally, I remind you that sentencing will be adjourned until receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report, scheduled for hearing on 20 November 2025. You remain on bail, subject to the existing conditions, pending that hearing.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Westminster. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
