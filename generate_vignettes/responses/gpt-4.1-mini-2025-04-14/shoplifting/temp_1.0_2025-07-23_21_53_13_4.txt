IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/20468  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. C. BENTLEY  
Filed: 12 September 2025

Mr H, you stand before this court on a charge relating to a course of conduct involving the theft of goods from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans approximately eighteen months and encompasses multiple visits to various shops located within the Greater Manchester area, notably including high street supermarkets, a pharmacy, and independent convenience stores.

Procedural History  
The procedural history of this matter reveals a series of events consistent with the case management protocols designed to facilitate timely resolution while ensuring the interests of justice are maintained. Your arrest occurred on 14 May 2025, following a detailed and protracted investigation conducted jointly by the Manchester Metropolitan Police Service and the Greater Manchester Retail Crime Partnership. The investigation encompassed an array of surveillance measures, including closed-circuit television footage collation, forensic examination of recovered property, and the utilisation of covert intelligence gathered from multiple retailers reporting persistent theft.

Although charges were preferred promptly after your arrest, progress was hampered by logistical challenges associated with handling evidential disclosure and the securing of expert reports. Defence counsel applied for a psychiatric assessment, which necessitated the instruction of an independent clinical psychologist authorised in early July 2025. These requirements occasioned adjournments, though the court notes the efforts of all parties to comply with the Better Case Management initiative and to bring the matter forward within the statutory guidelines.

It remains regrettable that the case was delayed in part due to administrative bottlenecks within the Legal Aid Agency. Similar issues have been the subject of recent judicial commentary, where the court has emphasised the imperative for prompt authorisation of expert services in cases involving potential mitigation predicated on mental health factors. Such delays are of particular concern given the potential adverse impact on the defendant’s right to a fair and timely trial, and the effective use of court time and public money.

The pleading pattern is not uncommon: an initial not guilty plea entered at first hearing, followed by a late admission of guilt shortly before the scheduled trial, prompted by the overwhelming prosecutorial case. Courts have repeatedly affirmed, notably in R v. Marwood [2023] EWCA Crim 1102, that while the law permits a plea to be entered up to the very last moment, sentencing credit reduces proportionally the later the plea is made, reflecting the additional burdens on witnesses, victims, and the court process.

Precedent of note includes the recent case R v. Summers [2024] EWCA Crim 2304, where the Court of Appeal considered the sentencing of a repeat shoplifter operating across multiple retail outlets in the Midlands with conduct that included concealment of stolen goods and deception of staff. There, an immediate custodial sentence was upheld despite the modest individual financial values, stressing the cumulative impact of offending and the necessity to uphold confidence in law enforcement and retail security measures.

In a seemingly unrelated domain, the court also recalls R v. Langford [2022] EWCA Crim 900, which involved a convicted individual charged with fly-tipping hazardous waste materials on public greenbelt land, an offence attracting significant environmental and public health concerns. This case, while distinct in nature, illustrates the breadth of offences that place strain on public resources and community well-being, akin to the cumulative burden inflicted by persistent retail theft. Though unrelated to your conduct, such cases emphasize the necessity of the criminal justice system’s overarching response to sustained disregard for the law and social norms.

Returning to the facts pertinent to you, a plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 17 August 2025, at which you tendered a plea of guilty to the representative charge encapsulating the extended pattern of theft. This admission, though welcomed, comes late in the proceedings and accordingly reduces the extent of credit achievable pursuant to the Sentencing Council’s guidelines.

It is worth reflecting on the complexity of modern retail theft investigations. A uniform approach does not fit all; the demands on police and prosecutors to assemble comprehensive packages of CCTV footage, victim statements, and forensic evidence in low-value cases are surprisingly substantial. Consequently, such offences, while ostensibly of limited financial impact individually, aggregate to impose a significant strain on public services.

There have been discussions in legal academia regarding the historical roots and evolution of sentencing guidelines for theft offences. The Theft Act 1968 itself was enacted in an era preceding digital retail surveillance and access control technologies, yet its application remains foundational in prosecuting unauthorised appropriation of property. The Crime and Courts Act 2013 furthermore reinforced sentencing principles with an emphasis on proportionate responses tempered by the personal circumstances of offenders.

Beyond the law, I echo the observations of Lord Justice Edis in R v. Hampton [2019] EWCA Crim 571 when he remarked on the social implications of acquisitive crime, cautioning against dismissing such offences as “victimless,” highlighting the real psychological and operational burdens borne by retail workers — burdens often unnoticed by the general public.

To this end, I wish to thank the representatives of the Manchester Business Improvement District and the Safer Retail Partnership for their assistance in collating victim impact statements and for their ongoing work to mitigate the deleterious effects of retail crime. Their endeavours are particularly laudable given the heightened challenges arising from resource constraints and the economic pressures faced by small business operators in this period of economic recovery.

The victim impact statements submitted portray a picture of disruption: staff anxiety, increased security measures, and a reduction in community amenity through the closure of outlets or the reduction in opening hours. These consequences merit serious consideration in assessing the overall harm occasioned.

The fact that the investigation also included collaboration with the City Digital Forensics Unit in processing mobile device data and in verifying transactional anomalies demonstrates the increasing sophistication of the policing response to such offences, underscoring the resources required to tackle what might seem, superficially, to be minor infractions.

It is a fact — not merely an observation — that such investigations can detract from tackling more serious crimes. As the National Crime Agency’s reports elucidate, resources allocated to persistent shoplifting investigations are diverted from the detection of violent crime and organised drug trafficking, with consequential impacts on overall public safety.

The court notes with concern that problems persist regarding staff shortages within the probation service nationally, which have affected timely and comprehensive preparation of reports, as confirmed by the Ministry of Justice’s recent annual statistics. Such delays impact sentencing decisions and ultimately rehabilitation pathways.

Within these proceedings, an independent psychiatric assessment was obtained from Dr Monica Wheeler, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, whose detailed report has been made available to the court and parties. Dr Wheeler conducted a series of assessments on 30 July 2025, incorporating both clinical interviews and psychometric testing.

She concluded that although you do not suffer from any major psychiatric disorder, there are indications of borderline personality traits characterised by impulsivity and a history of emotional instability. She further noted tendencies towards episodic alcohol misuse but found no evidence of psychosis or cognitive incapacity that would mitigate culpability significantly. The report also mentions prior engagement with mental health services during adolescence but an absence of contact in recent years.

Dr Wheeler recommends a structured intervention incorporating cognitive-behavioural therapy with a focus on emotion regulation and impulsivity management, alongside active participation in community-based support to address substance misuse risks. The report emphasises the necessity of sustained engagement for any meaningful rehabilitation.

It is of note that these findings align with the newest psychological insights into the etiological pathways of acquisitive offending, where impulsivity and poor coping mechanisms often interplay with social deprivation, but are not determinative excusers for criminal conduct.

Concurrently, I should record that the defence has submitted a letter from your elder sibling, Ms Francesca H, dated 24 August 2025, which speaks of your upbringing in a household marked by economic hardship and familial instability. The letter describes the family’s efforts to provide support, despite limited means and ongoing health problems affecting both parents.

The letter, whilst evocative and written with evident concern, must be balanced carefully against the recognition that many defendants cite challenging backgrounds without demonstrable impact on their propensity to offend. The courts must remain vigilant to distinguish between genuine mitigating factors and narrative devices intended to elicit sympathy.

The Local Authority Housing Department provided a brief communication indicating that you currently reside in temporary accommodation following a period of homelessness earlier this year. The correspondence confirms the placement but offers no indication of planned long-term housing solutions, reflecting the broader challenges faced by social housing authorities amid waitlists and funding shortfalls.

It bears acknowledgement that homelessness and accommodation insecurity are recognised risk factors for offending and recidivism. However, as articulated in the case of R v. Templeton [2021] EWCA Crim 801, such circumstances, while significant, do not excuse recidivist behaviour, particularly where interventions and support services have been accessed or offered.

On the subject of ancillary issues, it is appropriate to comment on some recent case law of peripheral note: R v. Finch [2020] EWCA Crim 2054, concerning aggravated robbery where the defendant was found carrying a blade in a school car park but had no direct connection to the instant matter; and R v. O'Malley [2023] EWCA Crim 1342, involving fly-tipping of regulated waste on a protected greenbelt which, while materially unrelated to retail theft, demonstrates the judiciary’s sensitivity to breaches of statutory environmental safeguards.

Returning to the current matter, there were previous community resolution attempts following an incident in late 2023 that did not involve your direct participation, but rather that of a co-defendant who ultimately absconded and remains at large. That defendant was charged with assaulting police officers with a chair during arrest and possession of indecent images, matters entirely separate from your case.

Your engagement with voluntary sector organisations has been sporadic at best, notwithstanding outreach from the local Citizens Advice Bureau and the Community Alcohol Support Service. In a letter dated 2 September 2025, the manager of the Manchester Community Outreach Programme expressed regret that efforts to maintain contact had been met with minimal success, emphasising the constraining effect of resource limitations on the provision of sustained support.

It is worth noting that similar patterns are routinely reported in probation caseloads, where competing demands and insufficient staffing result in less consistent oversight — a regrettable systemic deficiency increasingly reported in parliamentary committees and reviews by the Inspectorate of Probation.

The court has also received a victim personal statement from the manager of one of the affected retail outlets, describing the stress caused to shop floor staff and the resulting operational adjustments that have had knock on economic effects on employment and local consumer confidence. Such representations carry considerable weight and underscore the tangible consequences of theft beyond mere financial loss.

At trial, the Crown called evidence from an expert in digital forensics, Mr Simon Grant, who described the methods used to recover and authenticate CCTV footage, which formed a significant part of the prosecution’s case. His testimony detailed challenges posed by timestamp discrepancies and the necessity of synchronising feeds from several independent systems. Such technical complexity evidences the sophistication required to adduce reliable evidence in offences perceived as straightforward.

In relation to case law, the Court is reminded of the principles laid down in R v. Beryl [2019] EWCA Crim 1600, concerning the sentencing of a repeat thief whose offending caused substantial psychological distress to elderly victims. Although the offending here lacks that particular aggravation, Beryl underscores the importance of recognising the broader human impact.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

The dynamics of your offending were marked by selective targeting of items with perceived resale value, including beauty products, over-the-counter medication, and confectionery, often concealed under clothing or in bags. You were observed employing distraction techniques and utilising knowledge of store layouts to evade detection.

Staff at one pharmacy affected reported a marked decrease in morale and multiple instances of anxiety-related absenteeism. Such indirect harms have wider community effects, not confined to immediate economic costs.

Notwithstanding prior cautions and the offer of support, your offending persisted, suggesting an entrenched pattern requiring focused intervention.

Sentencing Considerations  
The court must weigh the seriousness of the offences, the impact on victims, the pattern of behaviour, and your personal circumstances. The delay in pleading guilty limits the extent of credit available, consistent with principles elucidated in R v. Bartlett [2020] EWCA Crim 1200.

The probation service is requested to prepare a report addressing the full range of sentencing options, including the suitability of a community order with rehabilitation activities tailored to address impulsivity and acquisitive offending, as well as any requirement for unpaid work. The report should also consider issues of substance misuse and housing stability as factors influencing risk management.

In deliberating sentence, the court observes the considerable pressures on social services and the criminal justice system alike. The complex interaction of homelessness, mental health, and offending behaviours places strain on multiple agencies. Nonetheless, these challenges do not absolve offenders of responsibility or diminish the need for proportionate accountability.

I wish to record my appreciation for the efforts of defence and prosecution counsel, Ms Joanna Strange and Mr Andrew Cole, who have conducted proceedings with professionalism and respect. Thanks are also due to court staff, ushers, and clerks for their diligent management of the listing and for maintaining decorum in the courtroom.

The court acknowledges that the courtroom in which this matter has been heard underwent refurbishment earlier this year, offering improved facilities for witness attendance and digital evidence presentation. Such investments, while welcome, remind us of the ongoing need to balance resource allocation against rising caseloads and expanding procedural complexities.

I must reiterate judicial concern regarding systemic delays in expert report commissioning, particularly within the Legal Aid framework. Such delays undermine timely justice and frustrate efforts to deliver proportionate sentencing outcomes in a manner consistent with the principles of fairness and efficiency.

Having considered the submissions of counsel, the reports presented, and the applicable legal framework, I postpone sentence pending receipt of the pre-sentence report and any updated psychiatric assessment should the probation service consider further liaison necessary.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 12 September 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Manchester pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. A formal transcript of these proceedings is recorded accordingly. The defendant is hereby advised of the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days, under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this instance. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
