IN THE CROWN COURT AT BELFAST  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/13846  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. P. Carrington  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before the court today to be sentenced in respect of charges arising out of a series of theft incidents from multiple retail outlets spanning a period from November 2023 to April 2025. These offences were brought under the Theft Act 1968, specifically section 1, concerning the dishonest appropriation of property with the intent to permanently deprive the rightful owners. The complainant businesses are primarily small-to-medium enterprises situated within the Greater Belfast area and adjoining commercial centres.

Procedural History  
This matter came into judicial process following an extended investigation coordinated by officers of the Belfast Metropolitan Police, in conjunction with local business crime reduction initiatives. The operation exploited a network approach integrating retail security teams, local council enforcement officers, and the Northern Ireland Business Crime Taskforce. On 27 April 2025, you were arrested and formally charged with a consolidated representative offence encompassing multiple occurrences of shop theft within the statutory period.

While typically such cases might be dealt with at a magistrates’ court level, the complexity and scope here necessitated allocation to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, designed to streamline the progression of indictable matters and prevent unnecessary delay or duplication.

Prior to your arrest, officers undertook surveillance and evidence collation over several months, often relying upon CCTV footage from multiple sources. The challenge posed by such evidence is well understood. Although advancements in video technology have been significant, much footage remains subject to questions of clarity and admissibility. In the present case, meticulous cross-referencing of time stamps and facial recognition software supplemented manual review, enabling investigators to link your presence across several offences.

On 6 May 2025, a plea and trial preparation hearing was held. Initially, you entered a not guilty plea. However, subsequently, after additional evidence—including a forensic examination of clothing items and an analysis of store receipt records—was disclosed, you changed your plea to guilty on 23 July 2025, shortly before the trial was scheduled. This late plea attracted discussions as to the appropriate level of sentencing credit and the impact on public resources.

It is worth noting, if only in passing, the pressures on court listing and adjournments caused by extended industrial action across the Northern Ireland Legal Services sector, which during the early months of this year contributed to unavoidable delays in case progression. Such systemic challenges have been widely acknowledged in judicial circles, yet they offer no mitigation for defendants but are matters purely of public administration. Your solicitors’ contribution to navigating this difficult landscape is acknowledged.

The Crown has advanced a prosecution case supported by witness statements, including shop floor staff and security personnel, as well as expert evidence from forensic scientists concerning textile fibre analysis. The defence has instructed a clinical psychologist and a social worker, whose reports have been received and considered in advance of this sitting. I commend the thoroughness of these expert assessments, although their practical relevance is limited given the nature of offending.

I am also grateful to the representative from the Belfast Retailers’ Support Group, who, despite constrained resources, provided detailed victim impact statements outlining the economic and emotional toll on affected businesses and employees.

It is necessary, in keeping with the usual practice, to acknowledge the ongoing challenge faced by the Probation Board for Northern Ireland. Its members have endured increasing caseloads, staff shortages, and more complex offender profiles in recent years. Their ability to monitor, supervise, and facilitate rehabilitation in cases exhibiting traits of acquisitive offending is constrained by budgetary pressures. This context, while not determinative, tempers expectations about what can reasonably be achieved in terms of community-based interventions.

Before turning to the facts, I wish to address a related but distinct matter of broader judicial concern: the adequacy of legal aid provision for defendants, particularly in respect of funding for specialist reports such as those commissioned here. The Legal Aid Agency of Northern Ireland has, regrettably, found itself unable to authorise funding promptly on multiple occasions, resulting in delays and adjournments. The conflict between fiscal prudence and fair representation remains an ongoing source of tension and criticism from court officers, practitioners, and defendants alike. It must be emphasised this court remains committed to upholding the defendant’s rights. However, procedural inefficiencies can prolong cases to the detriment of all participants.

We are also reminded in passing of the complexities involved in multi-agency partnerships designed to tackle petty crime. The Belfast Business Crime Forum, established with the express purpose of uniting retailers, law enforcement, and civic leaders, has grappled with competing priorities and the fluidity of offender profiles. While cooperation has improved markedly over recent years, caseloads remain high, and the capacity to intervene preemptively limited. This lawsuit reflects the challenges of maintaining public confidence amid crime patterns insufficiently visible on headline police statistics yet deeply felt locally.

Among the more peripheral matters the court notes is the recent refurbishment of Court 5, which has improved both accessibility and acoustics, facilitating better hearings for all parties. Staff ushers and clerks are to be commended for maintaining decorum despite busy lists and fluctuating attendance attributed in no small part to the ongoing public health considerations.

I turn now to relevant case law which provides the judicial context for sentencing in matters of this nature. It is helpful to recall that section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the principal statutory provision, defining the conduct with clarity but allowing judicial discretion to account for context, scale, and impact.

In R v. Samuels [2019] NICA 15, the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence of eight months for a defendant who had committed a series of thefts directed at small shops over a six-month period. The Court emphasised the cumulative effect of repetitive offending, particularly where victims experienced heightened anxiety and enhanced security costs.

More recently, R v. McDonagh [2023] NICA 40 considered the significance of offender engagement with support services. The judgement highlighted that where an offender failed persistently to cooperate with rehabilitation schemes and displayed little remorse, the sentencing court was justified in imposing an immediate custodial term.

In the English jurisdiction, R v. Lacey [2021] EWCA Crim 1523, although concerned with importation of illicit substances, underscored the principle that pattern offending with demonstrable disregard for prior warnings warranted firm deterrence.

I also note the judgment in R v. Pearson [2020] EWCA Crim 1180 relating to a defendant who had abused community-based orders and breached bail conditions repeatedly before being placed on licence recall. While factually distinct, it illustrates the court’s intolerance of recidivism and non-compliance with judicial directions.

As a brief aside, it is also of interest that in R v. Stanton [2018] EWCA Crim 372, a case involving cases of affray following a disturbance in a licensed premises, the Court reasserted the need for proportionality but refused to tolerate behaviour with the potential for public disorder. This is of course disconnected from the present criminal context, but the principle of maintaining public confidence remains relevant across offence categories.

Similar observations are found in R v. Byrne [2017] NIQB 44, where a conviction for graffiti on public transport infrastructure was affirmed. The Court emphasised the symbolic import of preserving public amenities and the deterrent necessity that small property crimes be addressed decisively. Again, while unrelated to your conduct, the case serves as a reiteration of the justice system’s equilibrium between proportionality and prevention.

Another unrelated but instructive example is R v. Gallagher [2021] NICA 28, concerning a defendant convicted of fly tipping on protected green belt land. The Court recognized the environmental harm and enforced a custodial sentence for persistent offending despite the absence of direct victim impact. This foregrounds the importance of societal interest in maintaining lawful behaviour across settings.

Facts of the Offending  
I turn, then, to the facts of the case against you. The prosecution alleges a series of theft incidents targeting multiple retail outlets including pharmacies, convenience stores, and specialist grocers, with a principal modus operandi involving concealment of goods on your person or within bags.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

The incident chronology reveals calculated recurring behaviour, frequently involving the use of misleading tactics such as feigning phone conversations, diverting staff attention, and exploiting busy periods such as lunchtime or weekend rush hours.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

On occasion, you are alleged to have employed layering techniques, wearing multiple garments to obscure concealed items, or have removed security tags in the presence of other customers.

One incident attracted police attention not only due to the theft itself but also because of an escalated confrontation involving a co-defendant who assaulted officers with a chair during arrest procedures. That conduct, however, is not attributed to you and bears no direct consequence for your culpability or sentence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Moreover, at no point were any weapons involved, nor were threats or acts of violence committed by you towards staff or customers. The offences describe economic and psychological harm, primarily in terms of loss of stock, increased security costs, and a general sense of unease amongst employees.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

It is apparent from victim impact statements that certain staff reportedly suffered from stress-related illness linked to repeated encounters with offenders. Some requested changes to shift patterns; others reduced their hours or resigned from posts citing anxiety. While these effects may not amount to physical harm, their cumulative impact on local retail workforce stability is not negligible.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Of note, you have also been subject to a previous community resolution for a similar offence in 2022, following a prior admission of guilt for shop theft at a supermarket in Newtownards. Despite intervention efforts and offers of support, including access to local addiction services and budgeting assistance, you recommenced offending behaviour within six months.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Such recycling of offending patterns is regrettably common in acquisitive crime, reinforcing the need for durable interventions and consideration of protective measures.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Despite these opportunities, you have neither maintained engagement with social services nor responded positively to probation outreach. Moreover, you report unstable accommodation arrangements, occasionally residing in temporary hostel facilities. The strain on housing and support infrastructure is well documented, but neither this court nor the community at large may condone criminal conduct as a substitute for lawful assistance.

Expert and Risk Assessments  
The report from Dr Michael Sanderson, consultant clinical psychologist, provides a comprehensive assessment of your mental health status. The conclusion is that you do not meet diagnostic criteria for any major psychiatric disorder, though traits of impulsivity and elevated stress responses are noted. The report emphasises the role of socioeconomic deprivation and lack of stable support networks in your offending trajectory.

Additionally, the probation pre-sentence report, prepared by Mrs Jennifer McKay, reflects similar themes. It documents previous convictions, an early history of school attendance difficulties, and ongoing unemployment. There is noted ambivalence toward offered interventions, intermittent compliance with probation appointments, and absence of a stable family environment. The report recommends intensive supervision coupled with cognitive behavioural work focused on impulsivity and decision-making.

The report acknowledges that the local community centre’s schemes designed to aid financial literacy and employability, including paid internships, were offered but declined. This refusal to engage is concerning in light of the persistent pattern of crime.

I note also the copy of correspondence from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive attached by your solicitor. It confirms your current situation as being in temporary supported housing pending the outcome of an application for permanent social tenancy. The backlog in housing provision is acute, with recent statistics indicating average waiting times exceeding 24 months in many urban areas. Nevertheless, housing need and criminal justice responsibility remain separate spheres.

The court emphasises that while social disadvantage and hardship are relevant contexts, they do not negate personal accountability for repeated theft offences, particularly where the offending is deliberate, targeted, and sustained over a considerable period.

In a further illustration of the environment in which cases such as yours arise, it is instructive to observe the workload facing digital forensic teams in contemporary policing. Specialized units, such as the Northern Ireland Police Cybercrime Unit, are frequently diverted to acquisitions of complex electronic evidence for cases involving national security. While such activity is undoubtedly vital, it reduces available resources for relatively 'low-level' crimes such as retail theft, increasing burdens on more generalist officers. The opportunity cost here must be borne in mind.

Likewise, the administrative strain on multi-agency collaboration forums, typified by the Magic Area Priority Panel (MAPPA) and Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC), frequently overshadows the realities of addressing repetitive shoplifting crimes. Time-consuming coordination efforts, record-keeping, and inter-agency communication demands compete with urgent casework, compounding systemic pressures.

Sentencing Considerations  
The offences are serious by virtue of persistence, planning, and the cumulative harm inflicted upon small businesses and their employees. Your late change of plea undoubtedly warrants some credit, though it was entered after overwhelming evidential disclosure.

I am conscious of the need to balance public protection, deterrence, and rehabilitation in arriving at sentence. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences directs focus to factors such as value stolen, frequency, offending history, and vulnerability of victims. While the sums involved in individual instances were modest, repetitive offending across multiple locations escalates culpability.

Notwithstanding your current difficulties, previous opportunities for diversion and support have not been seized. This court must send a clear signal that persistent theft—regardless of underlying hardship—has consequences.

The court is encouraged to note the proactive involvement of victim liaison officers working within the Belfast Retail Crime Partnership. Their efforts in providing support and navigating compensation processes are acknowledged and commendable, evidencing a victim-centred approach.

It remains, however, the cold reality that shoplifting offences, when repeated and deliberate, impose real costs not only in monetary terms but in psychological impacts and community confidence. The erosion of trust undermines the social fabric and must be addressed firmly.

In this sentencing decision, I will therefore require a detailed pre-sentence report exploring all viable options for your rehabilitation, the possibility of a community order with appropriate requirements, and any combination of custody or suspended sentence. I will request specific attention to programmes targeting theft-related cognition and behavioural change, as well as accommodation stability support.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Belfast. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentence will be notified in due course following receipt of up-to-date pre-sentence assessments. You are reminded of your right to appeal within 28 days as provided by the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and associated jurisdictional statutes. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs remain reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
