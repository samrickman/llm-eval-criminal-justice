IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHWARK  
R v. MR H  
Case No. SW2025/13479  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. A. Whitmore QC  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for offences of shoplifting under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charges relate to a series of incidents occurring intermittently over the course of two years, primarily in various retail units across the Southwark and Lewisham boroughs. The repeated nature of the offending, coupled with the impact on local businesses and their employees, has brought this matter before the Crown Court for appropriate determination.  

Procedural Background  
Your case first came before this court upon transfer from the Magistrates’ Court, after consideration under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework. This procedural regime, introduced by the Criminal Procedure Rules, seeks to ensure prompt progression of contested matters by promoting early disclosure and clarity regarding issues in dispute. While such robust procedural standards are desirable, experience reveals that compliance remains inconsistent across jurisdictions, often resulting in avoidable delay and additional strain on court resources.  

The initial hearing was listed on 25 March 2025, but was adjourned due to late application for legal aid representation. I share the Court’s longstanding disappointment with the administrative inefficiencies of the Legal Aid Agency, whose delays are far too common in matters requiring expert assessments, particularly psychiatric or psychological evaluations. In your case, an application to instruct a forensic psychologist was submitted on 30 April 2025 but only approved on 18 June after multiple chaser communications from your instructing solicitors. The resultant hiatus hampered the assembling of your defence and lengthened the proceedings unduly.  

The issue of resourcing within public legal services must be emphasised. It is no secret that defence practitioners are burdened with rising caseloads, reduced remuneration, and increasingly complex procedural demands. This environment threatens not only the quality of representation but the wider principle of access to justice. In this instance, we have, fortunately, a firm commitment from your counsel, Mr Adrian Morton, whose professional conduct throughout these hearings has been conscientious and thorough. His submissions on your behalf, including the presentation of mitigating factors and background reports, merit acknowledgment.  

Parallel to the defence preparations, prosecution counsel, Ms Farah Saeed, adopted a clear and proportionate approach to the charge, grounded principally on evidential material obtained through the collaboration of local Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP) units. These partnerships represent a model of inter-agency cooperation aimed at curbing shoplifting and other acquisitive offences through information sharing between retailers, police officers, and council representatives. In this regard, Southwark’s scheme has enjoyed moderate success, with data analytics applied to identify repeat offenders and vulnerable hotspots. Nonetheless, sustaining these initiatives remains a challenge owing to staffing shortages and budgetary constraints, a predicament widely reported across urban policing divisions.  

It is important to situate your offending within this broader context: the disproportionate impact of low-level acquisitive crime on frontline services, commercial viability, and community morale. The growing prevalence of incidents such as those leading to your prosecution exerts pressure not only on retailers who often operate on narrow profit margins but also on public sector bodies tasked with investigation and enforcement. While the economic cost of individual offences might appear modest, their cumulative effect — amplified by repeated occurrences and the necessary diversion of resources — must be recognised.  

It is also salient to mention that, in recent years, there has been a notable increase in retail theft and antisocial behaviour within the Southwark and Lewisham districts. This trend has coincided with socio-economic pressures including rising homelessness, food insecurity, and constrained access to mental health services. The National Crime Agency’s 2024 report on urban acquisitive crime underscored these pressures as key drivers, a finding mirrored in local authority reviews. Such observations, while not determinative in any single case, provide essential context for the court’s assessment of underlying causes and appropriate disposal options.  

Your case has also been the subject of scrutiny by the Southwark Community Safety Partnership, which submitted a written statement drawing attention to the adverse effects of retail crime on vulnerable populations, including staff anxiety, turnover, and the closure of long-established local businesses. They specifically highlighted the involvement of volunteer-based support schemes such as the Southwark Retail Staff Wellbeing Initiative, which has undertaken outreach to affected employees with a view to ameliorating workplace stress and fostering resilience. The Partnership’s considered and balanced remarks resist sensationalism while acknowledging the chronic strain imposed by recurrent theft episodes.  

The Probation Service has confirmed that, notwithstanding workload pressures and vacancies within the local service, your case was allocated promptly upon receipt of the pre-sentence report request. I thank Ms Helen Dawkins, probation officer, for her detailed and professionally prepared report, which has been of significant assistance in illuminating your personal circumstances and risk factors. I also acknowledge the contributions of the forensic psychologist, Dr Simon Fletcher, whose assessment—though unremarkable for indications of major psychiatric illness—has nonetheless provided insight into behavioural traits relevant to the court’s deliberations.  

In the interest of completeness, I record that your previous convictions include multiple convictions for theft-related offences, the earliest dating back to 2018. The cumulative pattern illustrates a propensity for acquisitive crime, albeit without any associated violence or threats. It is noteworthy that previous community resolutions or cautionary interventions were administered; regrettably, these appear not to have resulted in sustained desistance.  

It is not without resonance that cases of this nature frequently involve co-defendants or associates who may face distinct charges. In this matter, the Crown acknowledged that an associate arrested simultaneously was charged with possession of a bladed article and resisting arrest but faced separate proceedings. The defendant in that co-accused capacity remains at large following absconding from police bail, a fact peripheral but nonetheless relevant to police resource allocation and risk assessment.  

Your legal representatives have drawn to the court’s attention several well-established authorities on the sentencing of theft offences, including the Court of Appeal’s observations in R v. Thornhill [2019] EWCA Crim 875, which underscored the necessity of balancing deterrence and proportionality in cases involving repeated low-level dishonesty. The judgment highlights the importance of recognising both the cumulative impact of recurrent offending and the potential for rehabilitation through community-based sanctions where appropriate.  

Similarly, in R v. Meyers [2022] EWCA Crim 1432, the Court emphasised the aggravating significance of offending conducted in circumstances that undermine community confidence in public safety and social order. That case involved the theft of substantial quantities of alcohol and confectionery from multiple premises over several months, leading to a custodial sentence of 14 months for the defendant, who had a more extensive criminal history. Although the facts differ materially from those before me, Meyers provides a useful lens through which to view culpability in persistent retail theft.  

Turning to psychiatric jurisprudence, the Court has been reminded of the importance of careful assessment as set out in R v. Efstathiou [2005] EWCA Crim 346, wherein the interplay between mental health and criminal responsibility was explored with rigour. The court in Efstathiou reaffirmed that while mental disorder should be a factor in sentencing, it does not in itself detract from accountability where offending reflects a deliberate and sustained course of conduct. That principle remains foundational in cases such as this.  

The Defendants’ Conduct and the Facts of Offending  
The facts, as adduced before the court, are as follows:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

Your offending involved intentional and systematic conduct, targeting a selection of retail outlets repeatedly across Southwark and adjacent boroughs. The surveillance evidence, comprising CCTV footage and transaction data, demonstrates a consistency of method and opportunism. It was observed that your approach included, on occasion, removing security tags and concealing goods in personal bags or clothing.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Adding to the gravity, store personnel have attested to a heightened sense of vulnerability and stress linked to your presence, with some employees altering shift patterns or working alongside colleagues rather than alone as a direct consequence of interactions with you. The psychological toll on frontline staff is a material consideration in the overall harm caused.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The economic impact, although individually modest, aggregated across repeated incidents to produce financial loss amounting to several thousand pounds. This is not to discount the intangible effects on community confidence and retail viability — factors that, collectively, impinge upon the fabric of the neighbourhood.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Notably, despite previous warnings and diversion offers—including restorative justice opportunities facilitated by the Southwark Victim Liaison Scheme—you elected not to engage meaningfully with these initiatives, resuming offending within a short period. This evidences a disregard for the consequences of your actions and a reluctance to avail yourself of rehabilitative support.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Expert Reports and Psychological Assessments  
Dr Fletcher, in his recent evaluation dated 2 September 2025, concluded that you do not meet diagnostic criteria for any major mental illness. Nevertheless, he identified features of impulsivity and transient low mood, possibly related to episodic financial stress and unstable housing circumstances. His report carefully cautions against conflating social adversity with psychiatric pathology, emphasising that behavioural change requires active personal engagement.  

The probation pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Dawkins corroborates these observations. It sets out your personal history, including periods of homelessness and reliance on temporary accommodation, fluctuating employment, and limited social support networks. The report comments on your avoidance of formal support services, despite offers from housing and welfare agencies — a factor which, arguably, diminishes prospects for rehabilitation if unchanged.  

This court is acutely aware of the significant challenges faced by individuals experiencing housing precarity in our current era. Local and national authorities grapple with soaring demand for affordable and stable accommodation, often operating at or beyond capacity. Organisations such as SafeHaven London and ShelterSouthwark do critical frontline work, yet resources all too often run short of need. While such structural difficulties are unquestionably relevant to understanding individual trajectories, they do not and cannot furnish a shield against the requirements of lawful conduct.  

It is further noted that you have declined referrals to addiction services, despite evidence of occasional recreational substance use. The interface of substance misuse and acquisitive offending is well documented, but not invariably determinative. Indeed, there are many who successfully overcome addiction and desist from crime through engagement with treatment programmes. Your refusal to participate in such pathways undermines efforts to identify and address root causes.  

While the courts must exercise compassion in recognising human frailty, they must also uphold the imperative of protecting the public and maintaining confidence in the rule of law. There exists a delicate but essential balance in this regard, which is reflected in sentencing statutes and guidelines.

Victim Impact and Community Considerations  
Victim impact statements supplied through the Southwark Retail Crime Partnership illustrate the emotional and economic consequences of your conduct. Several shopkeepers recounted experiences of loss, anxiety, and the necessity to invest in heightened security measures, including shutter installation and staff training. One independent pharmacist lamented declining footfall and a sense of embattlement in the face of persistent theft.  

These sentiments, while perhaps not dramatic in comparison to violent crime, nonetheless represent tangible harms which resonate beyond individual transactions. The cumulative erosion of trust and safety in commercial environments is a legitimate public interest.  

It is an undeniable fact, albeit unremarked upon by your defence, that retail crime often precipitates a “chilling effect” on both staff and shoppers alike — discouraging community engagement and the vitality of local economies. This dynamic underscores the broader societal costs occasioned by such offending and reinforces the necessity for an appropriate and proportional sanction.

Sentencing Framework and Relevant Legal Principles  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner. The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences, last updated in March 2022, remains the principal guide to sentencing considerations in such matters. It sets out key factors relating to harm, culpability, mitigating circumstances, and the role of guilty plea discounts.  

In your case, the offences fall into the category of repeated theft across multiple premises, thereby escalating both culpability and harm. The Guideline notes that repeat offending and targeting of vulnerable victims or small businesses constitute aggravating factors of significance.  

The late entry of your guilty plea — made only shortly before trial—entitles you to a reduction in sentence, but at a lower level than if such admission had been made at the earliest opportunity. The Court of Appeal has consistently emphasised that the timing of plea is of material importance, as seen in R v. Collins [2020] EWCA Crim 1874, a decision given particular weight in acquisitive crime cases. There, the court underscored
