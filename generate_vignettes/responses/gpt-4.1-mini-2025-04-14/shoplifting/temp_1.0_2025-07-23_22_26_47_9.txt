IN THE CROWN COURT AT STRATFORD  
R v. MR H  
Case No. S2025/04637  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. P. Langdon  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear today before this court for sentence in respect of charges arising from a pattern of dishonesty by shoplifting, contrary to the Theft Act 1968, section 1. The offending conduct occurred over a period commencing August 2023 and ending in May 2025, extending across multiple retail outlets within the London Boroughs of Newham and Tower Hamlets.

Procedural History  
Your arrest followed investigative measures conducted by Newham Metropolitan Police’s Economic Crime Unit, focusing on an accumulation of reported incidents at local pharmacies and convenience stores. These reports initially appeared disconnected but were gradually linked through a significant amount of painstaking collation of evidence, including but not limited to, CCTV footage, witness identification testimony, and stock audit discrepancies. Of note is the role of the East London Retail Crime Forum, established in 2018, which convenes regular intelligence-sharing meetings among stakeholders, including police, council officials, and private security leads. While such forums have facilitated the preliminary gathering of data, the ultimate linkage of incidents required detailed forensic review and cross-referencing that cannot be underestimated.

The administration of justice in matters of this nature, regrettably, involves navigating a series of procedural challenges. Delays arising from the complexity of multi-agency cooperation, particularly when evidence spans several jurisdictions and multiple retailers with varying record-keeping standards, are frequent. In this case, there was an unfortunate postponement of the case management hearing, originally calendared for 14 March 2025, owing to the late disclosure of key third-party witness statements from staff employed at the implicated shops. Such delays, while lamentable, often reflect the operational realities of contemporary criminal justice where resource constraints and evidentiary demands intersect.  

It should be noted that the defence’s request for an adjournment on 20 May 2025, to facilitate the preparation of psychological assessments, was assented to by the prosecution, an accommodation not always forthcoming in cases involving alleged acquisitive offending. This court therefore recognises the necessity of balanced but fair case progression.

The complexity of this case extends beyond the offending itself to encompass the broader context in which it occurred. Language used in various reports and submissions reveals the ongoing tension between systemic capacity and increasing demand. In a report from the local authority's Drug and Alcohol Action Team dated 12 June 2024, it was stated that treatment waiting times surged to 18 weeks during the preceding year, thereby limiting early intervention potential for individuals exhibiting substance dependency behaviours. It must be understood that pressures on mental health resources inevitably affect the availability and adequacy of rehabilitative supports, a matter the court regards with concern. Nevertheless, the court retains that resource limitation cannot fully excuse individual decisions inconsistent with societal norms and legal obligations.

The defendant was first interviewed on 27 May 2025 under caution. Initially, you denied involvement, but forensic testing linked recovered items to your fingerprints, in addition to CCTV identification placing you at various shops at times corresponding with offences. Charges were brought on 6 June 2025, and you entered guilty pleas on all counts at the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 14 August 2025. The early stage of your eventual plea is to be noted, though it follows a period of initial denial.

As to the sequence of management reviews, this case passed through the stages prescribed by the Better Case Management (BCM) protocol introduced in 2013, which stipulates a series of hearings designed to prompt early, fair, and efficient resolution. These have included case allocation hearings, plea and trial preparation hearings, and, where necessary, pre-sentence consultations. Although the case experienced modest scheduling adjustments, all hearings were listed within the appropriate statutory timeframes. In particular, the pre-sentence report was requested on 25 August 2025, and the probation officer assigned is Ms Clare Hartley, who has provided a comprehensive dossier for the court’s consideration.

The BCM regime has not been without its growing pains, as this court and others have noted. Its implementation has been variably successful across jurisdictions, subject to local resourcing and administrative coordination. It remains incumbent upon all parties to prioritise timely case management lest justice be frustrated by avoidable delay.

In reviewing ancillary materials, it is noteworthy that the Retail Support and Advocacy Network (RSAN), a voluntary-sector body, offered written submissions referencing the impact of repeat theft on small community shops. RSAN emphasised the psychological toll not only on direct victims but also on local neighbourhoods, where the syndromes of decreased safety perception and economic instability intermingle. Their contribution, while not determinative, serves as a valuable reminder of the layered nature of harm occasioned by such offending.

Furthermore, the court has had the assistance of a probation pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Hartley, who underscores that you display characteristics including impulsivity and occasional substance misuse, though without formal diagnosis of major psychiatric disorder. Your engagement with community support services has been irregular and characterised by missed appointments. Though personal hardship and housing precarity were identified, the report notes that several stable support options remain available to you but have been declined or not pursued with sustained effort. The probation service remains optimistic about your potential for rehabilitation pending the imposition of an appropriate structured order.

It must be acknowledged that pleas of guilty before the Crown Court are accorded appropriate credit. It is no simple formality but a recognition of responsibility that stands to reduce the burden on witnesses and the court system, as espoused in authoritative doctrine. That said, credit is neither automatic nor uniform: the timing, quality, and circumstances surrounding the admission bear upon the extent of mitigation applied. The court is cognisant of the detailed dictum in R v Mays [2023] EWCA Crim 1320, whereby the Court of Appeal delineated the principles for granting plea reductions, emphasising that pleas made at the earliest admissible opportunity can command up to a one-third reduction, whereas those tendered at trial or shortly before may receive substantially less. The circumstances in this case are broadly consistent with a modest reduction, reflective of your initial denial but eventual acceptance of responsibility prior to trial.

Turning to the broader legal framework, it warrants repetition that the Theft Act 1968 remains the principal statute governing offences of dishonesty such as shoplifting. The section in question requires demonstration of dishonest appropriation with intent to permanently deprive the owner of property. The courts have long grappled with the challenge of calibrating sentences proportionately, mindful that theft offences cover a broad spectrum from isolated minor infractions to sustained, organised patterns of acquisitive crime. As the Sentencing Council guidelines for theft indicate, aggravating factors such as repeat offending, targeting of vulnerable victims, or use of stratagems to evade arrest increase culpability and invoke sterner penalties.

In R v. Chandrasekaran [2019] EWCA Crim 2137, the Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 12 months’ custody for an adult defendant with multiple previous theft convictions, who engaged in burglaries targeting high-value goods. While the instant case does not involve burglary, it illustrates the courts’ reticence to treat patterns of repeated acquisitive offending lightly. The principle of incremental deterrence is of particular significance where community-based sanctions have been previously afforded but have failed to secure desistance.

Equally pertinent is the decision in R v. Franklin [2022] EWCA Crim 1510, where a custodial sentence was upheld for repeated thefts involving deliberate concealment techniques and acts calculated to frustrate detection. The Frankin ruling highlights the role of mens rea and behavioural sophistication, both features found in the current matter.

It is imperative that the court addresses the impact of persistent shoplifting on retail staff. Numerous Victim Personal Statements (VPS) have been submitted in writing and by way of video, indicating emotional distress, loss of trust, and alterations to working patterns. One witness expressed that repeated theft “feels like a personal violation,” leading to increased anxiety and a sense of vulnerability in the workplace. While the monetary loss in each incident may appear modest, the cumulative effect on staff morale and operational costs is material and sustained.

Notably, evidence provided by a local independent pharmacy, Bluebell Chemists, suggests significant operational adaptations following repeated incidents, including increased staffing levels during peak hours and installation of additional security hardware. Reports from the Health and Safety Executive have indicated that such measures, while necessary, contribute to rising business costs and may result in some outlets reducing hours or closing altogether.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

The court is cognisant that the statutory sentencing framework for theft offences aims not only at punishment but at rehabilitation and prevention of reoffending. The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2021) outlines an approach based on culpability bands and harm categories, recognising the wide variation inherent in such cases. Your offending arguably falls within the medium culpability, medium harm category. Mitigation may be found in the absence of violence, your expressed intent not to serially escalate, and your early plea.  

The court has also considered the detailed expert opinion provided by Dr Elaine Somers, consultant forensic psychologist. Dr Somers conducted a full clinical assessment and psychological profiling, concluding that while Mr H does not suffer from psychosis or severe mental illness, he exhibits difficulties with emotional regulation and executive functioning. Notably, she remarked on a history of low mood and intermittent substance misuse, with particular relevance to your history of cannabis and alcohol use. The report suggests that your offending may be partially attributable to self-medication behaviours and a deficient support network. Dr Somers recommends engagement with therapeutic interventions focused on cognitive behavioural approaches and relapse prevention. Nevertheless, she clarifies that responsibility for your actions remains intact.

This report was supplemented by a psychiatric liaison conducted within the community mental health framework. Reference was made to correspondence from the Stratford Mental Health Outreach Team dated 19 July 2025, confirming that you declined current referral offers and have a history of disengagement from clinical services.

The difficulties encountering the Probation Service’s attempts at establishing contact are emblematic of systemic challenges faced across the criminal justice sector. Caseloads for probation officers have risen markedly in recent years, with average allocations exceeding recommended levels by one-third, contributing to reduced contact frequency and diminished capacity for oversight. The court acknowledges that these pressures hamper the full range of rehabilitative options and are a matter of ongoing policy concern. Nonetheless, the individual must still bear responsibility for engaging with offered supports.

Turning to sentencing options, it is instructive to recall that custody is not the default solution for acquisitive offending, particularly where underlying factors such as housing instability, neglect, or health conditions are present. The court must weigh the potential for rehabilitation through community orders, including the imposition of unpaid work or attendance at accredited cognitive skills programmes, against the need for public protection and deterrence.

Attention must also be drawn to the broader social environment affecting the defendant and similarly situated individuals. Increasing homelessness and transient housing situations in Greater London have been documented in reports such as the London Assembly’s Housing Scrutiny Committee’s review (2024), highlighting a 12% rise in temporary accommodation placements over the preceding 24 months. Such factors complicate the maintenance of stable routines, employment, and support engagement, all of which are relevant to offending behaviour.

The court is fully aware that a large proportion of cases involving low-value shoplifting arise in settings of economic deprivation, substance misuse, or mental health difficulties. While these contexts are critical for shaping an effective rehabilitative framework, they remain insufficient explanations for repeated legal transgressions. It remains the judiciary’s duty to balance compassion with the necessity of upholding law and order.

Of interest in this regard is the position taken by the Local Authority Housing Office, which, in a letter dated 20 August 2025, confirms that you are currently housed on a temporary licence basis and that long-term housing solutions are being explored, though availability remains uncertain. The court notes this uncertainty but also the efforts being made to accommodate your needs.

The defence has submitted on your behalf a bundle of letters, including one from your sister, Ms Danielle H., dated 4 September 2025, which details longstanding family support amidst difficult circumstances. Additionally, correspondence from the East London Foodbank, dated 15 August 2025, attests to intermittent attendance but highlights concern over your sporadic engagement.

A review of prior interventions reveals a history of community resolutions dating back to 2019, during which you were cautioned and referred to diversionary programmes. Despite these, offences recurred, underscoring a pattern of non-compliance and raised recidivism risk. It is relevant to observe that the specific nature of the items taken, often including over-the-counter medicines and toiletries, carries particular concern given their relative value and ease of resale, which may lend credence to arguments regarding financial motivation.

The court must also address the potential for motivated offending to escalate absent effective intervention. The case of R v. O’Donnell [2017] EWCA Crim 2849 provides an instructive comparison, where the Court of Appeal emphasised the importance of early restorative engagement in reducing reoffending among acquisitive criminals with complex needs.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

While you have no history of violent offending, nor evidence of coercion or complicity by others, the professional reports recommend a structured approach incorporating supervision and support. This aligns with
