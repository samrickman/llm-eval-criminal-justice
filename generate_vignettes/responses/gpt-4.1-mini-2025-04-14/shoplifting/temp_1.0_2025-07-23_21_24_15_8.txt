IN THE CROWN COURT AT LIVERPOOL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/14478  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. E. BARKER  
Filed: 18 September 2026  

Mr H, you come before this court for sentencing on a charge relating to an extended course of shoplifting offences, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This conduct, spanning the period from early 2024 through to mid-2026, predominantly took place within the retail precincts of Liverpool city centre and various adjacent neighbourhoods.  

Procedural History  
Your arrest occurred on 10 July 2026 following a detailed investigative operation undertaken by the Liverpool Police Business Crime Unit, in conjunction with the Liverpool Retailers’ Partnership. This operation was prompted by a discernible increase in thefts reported across a cluster of local convenience stores and high street chains, many of which share common characteristics vulnerable to repeat offending. The initial intelligence arose following a spike in reported losses at a pharmacy chain located near Lime Street station.  

The investigation, characterised by methodical collation of CCTV footage, analysis of stock discrepancy reports, and interviews with store personnel, was representative of the increasing demands placed upon policing resources in the face of acquisitive crime that, while often low in individual value, cumulatively represents a significant burden on retail businesses and public order. It is no discredit to those charged with investigation, many of whom are stretched to breaking point, that such cases require weeks of sustained effort to arrive at charge.  

Your initial interview took place on 15 July 2026 under caution. At that time, you repudiated all allegations, asserting mistaken identity and an alibi. However, as the prosecution case progressed, a nexus was formed between your described appearance and distinctive clothing worn during incidents, as well as forensic evidence recovered in searches of your residence. Charge was laid on 4 August 2026.  

This case was allocated to the Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, an initiative which aims to expedite proceedings, reduce unnecessary delays, and optimise court listing efficiency. While the BCM protocol has been subject to critique regarding its average effectiveness across differing jurisdictions, in this instance the cooperation between all parties was commendable and achieved timely progression to the present sentencing stage.  

Several procedural adjournments occurred prior to today's hearing, predominantly attributable to defence applications for further disclosure and the commissioning of a psychiatric evaluation. While such matters inevitably extend case duration, they reflect essential safeguards safeguarding procedural fairness.  

It is worth observing that intermittent delays attributable to Legal Aid funding authorisations for expert involvement remain a systemic problem. In your case, the application to instruct an independent forensic psychologist was first submitted on 1 August 2026, but ultimately approved only on 22 August 2026 after protracted correspondence and multiple requests for supplementary information. These recurrent bureaucratic impediments do a disservice to defendants, practitioners, and ultimately the administration of justice.  

Those working in voluntary and charitable sectors continue to play an important role in supporting both victims and defendants in cases such as these. Witness statements received from the Liverpool Shopkeepers’ Association highlight the operational strain placed on small businesses by thefts of this nature. In particular, staff anxiety, increased security costs, and lowered morale were cited as significant consequences. While no physical harm resulted, the destabilising effect on local commerce and community confidence is palpable.  

I take this opportunity to note the continued efforts of the Liverpool Community Support Network, who maintain an outreach programme directed at offending behaviours related to economic hardship and substance misuse. Their submissions speak to the interconnectedness of social and criminal dynamics, though I emphasise the court’s primary responsibility is adjudication, not social policy.  

Legal Context  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as “dishonestly appropriating property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.” The applicable sentencing guidelines emphasise factors including the value of goods stolen, the nature and circumstances of the offence, and any aggravating or mitigating features such as use of force or vulnerable victims.  

Relevant appellate authority includes the decision in R v. Thornton [2022] EWCA Crim 342, where the Court of Appeal upheld the imposition of an immediate custodial sentence for repeated shoplifting from pharmacies in which medication and hygiene products were stolen in significant volume. The court underlined the societal impact of persistent theft from vulnerable commercial premises and the importance of effective deterrence.  

Similarly, R v. Granger [2023] EWCA Crim 400 concerned the theft of electronic goods from multiple retail outlets. Despite the relatively low value of individual items, a significant sentence was upheld due to the calculated and ongoing nature of the offending, including the use of distraction techniques on staff. The court stressed the importance of recognising the cumulative effect of repeated offending on individual victims and local commerce.  

In addressing proper credit for guilty pleas, I am mindful of the ruling in R v. Sutherland [2021] EWCA Crim 1571, which emphasises that such credit is discretionary and must reflect genuine remorse and timely acceptance of responsibility. Late pleas, especially those entered only after overwhelming evidence is presented, may receive a markedly reduced discount.  

I also note that offences bearing resemblance to R v. Eastman [2020] EWCA Crim 2229, involving conspiracy to fly-tip large quantities of waste on protected land—committed by unrelated co-defendants—have no bearing whatsoever on your case, save as a peripheral observation of the broad ambit of criminal conduct that courts address.  

Facts of the Offence  
The facts of the case are as follows:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

The modus operandi was sufficiently consistent to enable identification from prior store reports and surveillance. On occasion, you were seen to conceal items within clothing and bags, sometimes making repeated trips into the same venues.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

It emerged that you adopted specific distraction techniques, including feigning phone conversations and engaging staff in peripheral discussions, to facilitate the removal of merchandise unseen. The targeted goods were predominantly health and beauty products, which are generally in high demand on the secondary market.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Victim impact statements submitted by the affected retail outlets reference altered staff rotas and calls for increased security measures, including the installation of additional CCTV cameras and employment of security personnel during peak hours. While physical confrontation was avoided, the resulting atmosphere was one of persistent apprehension among employees.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Despite prior warnings and a community resolution disposal offered in late 2025 following an earlier incident, you returned to offending activity with little hesitation.

Psychiatric and Probation Reports  
The independent expert report commissioned at defence request was completed by Dr Elena M. Hughes, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, whose findings were presented and considered today. Dr Hughes concludes that while there is no diagnosis of major mental disorder, you exhibit traits associated with impulsivity and a degree of emotional dysregulation consistent with mild to moderate underlying anxiety. There is no evidence of psychosis or cognitive impairment. The report notes your history of unstable accommodation and intermittent employment, circumstances which may influence offending behaviour.  

It is regrettable that engagement with support services, including those addressing financial management and substance misuse, has been sporadic and insufficient. Dr Hughes emphasises the importance of structured intervention to address criminogenic needs, noting the risk of recidivism absent such engagement.  

I also have before me the presentence report prepared by probation officer Ms Hannah L. Clarke. Her report highlights modest risk of reoffending but cautions that the absence of stable housing and meaningful employment are significant destabilising factors. Ms Clarke notes that the strain on probation resources across the Liverpool area has increased markedly in the past three years, in common with national trends, complicating the provision of consistent supervision and rehabilitative programming.  

It is a matter of public record and concern that the Probation Service has been subject to recurrent underfunding pressures, resulting in palpable challenges to offender management, particularly for individuals with complex and overlapping needs. These realities underscore the importance of securing appropriate interventions as part of sentencing.  

You are currently aged 34. Your criminal record includes four previous convictions for shoplifting related offences, the earliest dated to 2019. Your last relevant disposal was a conditional discharge imposed in December 2025 following an incident involving theft from a supermarket in Bootle.  

The court notes the absence of any convictions involving violence or drug offences, nor is there evidence of gang involvement or organised criminality. You report limited family contact and are presently residing in temporary accommodation. 

Contextual Observations on Public Services  
It is, regrettably, common knowledge within this jurisdiction that the Legal Aid Agency’s current funding protocols and authorisation procedures impose considerable delay on the timely instruction of expert reports and necessary assistance. This state of affairs serves neither defendants nor the court well and ought to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  

Likewise, the overstretched capacity of mental health services in the region, including the Adult Community Mental Health Teams (CMHTs) operated by Liverpool NHS Foundation Trust, creates significant waiting lists and limits availability of therapeutic intervention. Individuals such as yourself, at the confluence of emotional instability and offending behaviour, face formidable barriers to accessing timely support.  

The court also acknowledges recent investigative reporting on the significant burden placed on digital forensic examination units within the Greater Manchester Police region, who are still managing a backlog of thousands of devices awaiting analysis. While unrelated directly to this case, such findings point to systemic pressure on law enforcement’s technical support resources, which inevitably delays investigation and prosecution efforts across the board.  

Sentencing Considerations  
This conduct, whilst not characterised by overt violence, was nonetheless persistent, planned, and calculated. The offences had tangible consequences for the victim businesses, their employees, and by extension, the local community.  

While your guilty plea, entered at the earliest practicable hearing once the strength of the evidence became apparent, is noted with some favour, credit is necessarily moderated given the protracted nature of proceedings and the prior denials.  

I am mindful of the guidance contained within the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline, which underscores the necessity of an approach calibrated to the scale of offending, the impact on victims, the defendant’s culpability, and prospects for rehabilitation.  

The court has also considered the mitigating factors of your lack of previous violent offending, the absence of significant mental illness, and personal circumstances including housing instability and unemployment. However, such factors do not negate responsibility nor excuse the persistence of theft as a coping mechanism.  

It is incumbent upon the court to balance the need to protect the public and deter further offending against the potential benefits of community-based rehabilitation. Your history suggests a pattern of resistant behaviour to prior diversionary measures. Nevertheless, the trajectory of your engagement with services since arrest may indicate a window for positive intervention.  

I direct that the probation service prepare an updated pre-sentence report which should assess the suitability of any appropriate community sentence, including but not limited to a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or unpaid work. Should the report identify a high risk of reoffending or require recommendation of custodial sentence, this will be clearly articulated.  

I note the adverse impact on the Retails Crime Unit’s resources during this investigation, which absorbed several officer months of time that might otherwise have been directed to tackling higher-harm crimes such as burglary, violent assault, or drug trafficking.  

Though unrelated to your case, it is worth reflecting on the recent judgment in R v. Carver [2025] EWCA Crim 873, where the Court of Appeal upheld a sentence for aggravated burglary of a private dwelling during an extended holiday absence. The robbers, armed and masked, inflicted significant psychological trauma on the victims, rendering the custodial term appropriate and proportionate to the gravity of violation. Although such offences are factually and morally distinct from retail theft, the case exemplifies the courts’ weighting of impact beyond mere property loss.  

Similarly, the court has observed in cases such as R v. Farrell [2024] EWCA Crim 456 how offences involving heroin supply near children’s playgrounds attract exemplary sentences. While not reflective of your offending, these instances provide a useful legal backdrop to the wider judiciary approach to public protection.  

Today’s hearing proceeded in open court, with all parties properly instructed and present. I thank Ms Julia Thorne, representing the Crown, and Mr Kevin Whitfield, who appears for the defence. I commend their professional conduct and articulate submissions.  

The layout and technological upgrades to this courtroom—installed last year at considerable public expense—have facilitated efficient proceedings, including remote evidence presentations, video links, and easy access to contemporaneous digital records. It is regrettable that these advances contrast with ongoing systemic issues in other aspects of the criminal justice system.  

As part of these remarks, I also record appreciation for the work of the court usher and clerical staff, whose skilful management ensures order and dignity are maintained amid the pressures of a busy listing schedule.  

Before concluding, I return briefly to victim considerations. Though commercial entities do not possess the same personal vulnerability as individual complainants in offences involving assault or abuse, the impact of sustained theft is real and cumulative. Staff turnover, increased stress, and financial loss contribute to an erosion of local retail provision and community wellbeing.  

I acknowledge a letter submitted by the manager of a local off-licence, a small independent business, who describes the effect of repeat thefts as “disheartening and demoralising” and references difficulties recruiting and retaining staff due in no small part to the ongoing threat of loss and harassment. Such perspectives warrant respect and reflection.  

Set against this are the social realities affecting individuals such as yourself—precarious living, limited employment opportunities, and insufficient support—which though no excuse, must inform a proportionate sentence that aims at rehabilitation.  

I have considered all probation and psychiatric inputs, the applications made by both prosecution and defence, the applicable sentencing guidelines, and the statutory provisions.  

Accordingly, I reserve sentence to be passed on receipt of the updated pre-sentence report from the probation officer assigned to this case. This report shall assess risk, personal circumstances, and potential for community-based intervention, drawing on evidence obtained since your arrest and current engagement.  

These sentencing remarks are issued today, 18 September 2026, in Court 5 at Liverpool Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentence will be communicated in due course. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to sections 108 and 109 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply under Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs directions await determination.  

These are the orders of the court.
