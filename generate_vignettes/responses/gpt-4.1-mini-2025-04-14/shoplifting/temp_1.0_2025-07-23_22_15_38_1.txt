IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEEDS  
R v. MR H  
Case No. C2025/05321  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. G. KENTON  
Filed: 17 September 2025

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence concerning a representative count of theft, specifically shoplifting from multiple retail premises across the Leeds metropolitan area over an extended period. Your offending spanned some fourteen months, ending in early 2025, and involved a series of carefully executed thefts which, by their frequency and impact, demanded a prosecution at this level rather than summary disposal.

Procedural History  
Your matter was first cited before the magistrates’ court on 2 May 2025, where an initial hearing took place. Due to the scale and inferred complexity of the offending, and in accordance with the thresholds set out in the magistrates’ protocol for persistent acquisitive offences, the case was committed to this Crown Court for sentencing following your earlier guilty plea to a representative charge on 5 August 2025. The decision to send the case to the Crown Court was in keeping with the established practice acknowledging that while individual thefts were of low value, the aggregate conduct represented a course of criminal behaviour that superseded the scope of magistrates’ sentencing powers.

Early procedural steps were hampered by multiple logistical issues notably involving the allocation of legal representation. A representation order was granted only after protracted engagement with the Legal Aid Agency’s regional office, which experienced significant staffing shortages. These shortages are well documented as a consequence of ongoing funding constraints and personnel turnover, issues which unfortunately contribute to delays in criminal proceedings nationwide, an issue the court decries as detrimental to efficient justice delivery.

It was at the plea and case management hearing, convened on 20 July 2025, that the prosecution disclosed a substantial evidential package, including numerous CCTV recordings from several retail chains, statements from shop staff, and electronic point-of-sale data corroborated by timestamped video sequences. The overwhelming nature of this evidence likely informed your eventual decision to enter a plea of guilty.

The court notes the support provided by the West Yorkshire Business Crime Partnership, whose collaboration following a meeting on 13 June 2025 was instrumental in pooling and cross-referencing intelligence relating to repeat thefts. Their careful collation of data, notwithstanding limited resources, evidences the ongoing commitment of business communities to tackling acquisitive crime. Their written submissions duly detail the operational burden such offences impose on retailers, including increased insurance premiums, reliance on expensive security technology, and staff turnover due to workplace stress. Affected premises demonstrated laudable professionalism in engaging with investigators despite significant emotional and financial strain.

It is, however, a cause of regret that the Legal Aid Agency’s processing delays deferred the securing of a clinical assessment by the community forensic psychiatric service until late August 2025. This delay was primarily due to administrative hurdles relating to the approval of expert work in cases perceived as low priority—a misapprehension which undermines the crucial role psycho-social evaluation plays in cases of persistent offender behaviour.

The BCM framework, which has been operating in this circuit since 2017, was applied in this matter with reasonable fidelity. Key milestones—such as the pre-trial review on 15 July—were conducted without fundamental adjournments, thereby avoiding undue burden upon witnesses and court resources. All counsel involved, including Ms Sandra Ellis (representing the Crown) and Mr Ian Douglas (defence counsel), are thanked for their diligent submissions, which the court found to be balanced and professionally delivered.

The statutory and common law principles pertinent to sentencing theft offences have been examined in detail. Reference is made to seminal authorities including R v. Halliday [2023] EWCA Crim 1196, which emphasises that theft forming part of a pattern of sustained acquisitive crime attracts sentences of a severity commensurate with the cumulative harm caused, notwithstanding individually low monetary values. Similarly, R v. Forsythe [2022] EWCA Crim 784 reiterates sentencing courts’ duty to consider the wider impact on victims’ livelihoods, psychological wellbeing, and local economies. These cases, among others, underscore the heavier sentencing weights applied to offenders who repeatedly flout judicial warnings and operate with deliberate planning.

Additional context has been derived from the Sentencing Council Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences, which stresses the significance of deliberate and repeated offending, the vulnerability of victims, and the import of early guilty pleas in mitigating sentence. The late entry of a plea by you in this case inevitably restricts the availability of discount, conforming to the jurisprudence established in R v. Simmonds [2021] EWCA Crim 1022.

Of note in the ancillary material before the court is correspondence from Methley Charity Outreach, which provides voluntary support to vulnerable adults, including those with histories of substance misuse and homelessness. Their letters reflect the ongoing pressures faced by local support agencies whose resources have been progressively eroded, lending a sobering perspective on the social milieu from which many offenders emerge. While these factors may, of course, provide empathetic context, they do not exempt individual accountability for criminal conduct.

Additionally, the court has perused a detailed psychological report completed by Dr Alistair Thornton, consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 9 September 2025. Dr Thornton writes that while no formal diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder or severe personality pathology is evident, there are identifiable traits relating to impulsivity and chronic low mood. Evidence of episodes consistent with untreated depressive illness and substance use (primarily alcohol) was documented. However, Dr Thornton concludes such factors do not substantially diminish the defendant’s capacity for rational decision-making nor negate criminal responsibility. This report also recommends further community-based interventions, including cognitive-behavioural therapy targeting impulsive conduct and improved engagement with addictive behaviour support services.

The court also has before it pre-sentence reports from the Probation Service prepared by Officer Hannah Dorset. These reports outline, inter alia, the defendant’s previous convictions, including three recorded shoplifting offences between 2018 and 2023, none of which resulted in immediate custodial penalties. While noting compliance issues, they also highlight modest pro-social engagement with local voluntary employment programmes.

Although the evidence was provided in a timely fashion and assessed with due diligence, it is worth commenting upon the increasing burden on probation officers nationally. Staffing levels have dwindled sharply in recent years, leading to unacceptably high caseloads and reduced capacity for offender supervision and support. The strain on this vital public service is by now widely recognised, with multiple parliamentary committees calling for urgent redress.

As to the circumstances of arrest, your apprehension occurred on 8 March 2025, following an incident caught on store CCTV. This led to the execution of a search warrant on your residence on 15 March 2025, during which items identified as stolen goods were recovered. The search was conducted under carefully regulated provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, ensuring compliance with procedural fairness and proportionality. You remain cooperative with custody officers and legal advisors, although your initial interview was characterised by denials, a position later abandoned.

Notable in the available evidence is your consistent choice of retail premises situated in relatively secluded or under-monitored locations, typically in smaller chain outlets or high street pharmacies. Such selections, combined with repeated use of identical accessories such as a particular brand of rucksack and gloves, indicate a premeditated approach designed to evade detection and prosecution.

It is pertinent to observe that apart from retail venues, this court has dealt with wholly separate offences in unrelated cases within this jurisdiction over the past six months. For instance, R v. McLean [2025] EWCA Crim 2014 concerned a burglary involving an occupier’s absence during summer holidays resulting in the theft of jewellery and electronics to the value of £8,000. That conviction, while serious, bears no factual connection to the matter presently before the court but is illustrative of the broader crime landscape afflicting the region.

Similarly, another sentencing judgment, R v. Marley [2024] EWCA Crim 1367, dealt with fly-tipping of construction materials on a greenbelt site adjoining the Leeds Outer Ring Road. That environmental offence, though unrelated to this case, reflects the diverse portfolio of criminal behaviours handled by this court.

Public policy considerations in sentencing shoplifting offences have increasingly recognised the multifaceted strains imposed on retail employees, some of whom have faced intimidation or verbal abuse when attempting to intervene. The stress related to these encounters has extended even into familial and social spheres, with unions reporting rising rates of burnout. It is within this framework that the court approaches your case, mindful of both individual circumstances and community welfare.

It is worth noting that during the course of this case, one co-defendant named in initial charges has absconded and remains at large, thereby delaying proceedings and necessitating procedural adjustments. The Deputy Chief Clerk has meticulously coordinated the trial list to maintain organisational efficiency despite such setbacks.

The court further acknowledges the time and effort invested by the Retail Support Consortium, whose staff have compiled victim impact statements and provided mediation services post-offence. Their contributions underscore the vital role of partnership working in addressing theft crime’s wider repercussions.

An additional administrative complexity arose due to a concurrent noise abatement order issued against the defendant’s landlord, necessitating coordination with environmental health officers but having no direct bearing on your conduct.

Of procedural interest, the court notes that interpreter services were required for the defendant’s partner during the sentencing hearing. Their timely attendance and cooperation is valued, and the court thanks the court usher team and the local judiciary’s administrative office for facilitating that accommodation without undue delay.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

To digress briefly, it bears remark that the standard courtroom layout has recently undergone refurbishment to improve accessibility and functionality, a change welcomed by both judiciary and litigants alike with the support of the building’s preservation society.

The prosecution relies heavily upon the principle elucidated in R v. Carter [2023] EWCA Crim 1571 which cautions against treating multiple low-value thefts in isolation. The cumulative effect on victims and commerce elevates the seriousness of offending and fuels justifications for custodial sentences where repeated breaches continue despite formal warnings.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

It is pertinent to observe that in a wholly distinct case, R v. Holloway [2022] EWCA Crim 1003, reference was made to possession of a bladed article on school premises. While factually unrelated and absent from the present proceedings, the complex balancing of public safety concerns in Holloway’s sentencing provides instructive context for judicial methodology when weighing aggravating factors.

Furthermore, correspondence from the Defendant’s sister, Miss Lorna H., submitted in mitigation, outlines family history and hardships of upbringing, highlighting episodes of domestic instability but stopping short of imputing causation to your conduct. While familial support is commendably present, reported disruption from childhood circumstances does not negate accountability.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

It is regrettable that the present case saw an initial defence plea of not guilty, which was maintained until evidence became overwhelming. This pattern is, unfortunately, a frequent feature that compounds the burden on victims and judicial resources alike.

Adding to the procedural milieu, the Municipal Fire Service was at one point notified regarding an unrelated alarm trigger in Court 5 on 18 April 2025, causing temporary disruption to scheduled hearings. Whilst non-impactful on this case, such events nonetheless illustrate the operational challenges frequently experienced within busy Crown Court centres.

The sentencing guidelines denote the importance of addressing offending cognitions and attitudes through structured rehabilitation. A report from probation notes marked impulsivity alongside difficulties in maintaining stable employment or tenancy, all factors influencing risk management strategies.

In keeping with published research on patterns of acquisitive offending, repeated theft often correlates with socioeconomic disadvantage compounded by limited access to mental health resources. The court is aware of chronic waiting times within the National Health Service for adult psychological counselling, a systemic issue the judiciary confronts with frustration but cannot directly ameliorate.

I also note in passing the decision in R v. Beaumont [2019] EWCA Crim 2105, concerning the theft of copper cabling from a rail depot. This matter, unrelated in both parties and offence date, nonetheless resonates with the present issue insofar as it demonstrates the varied manifestations and approaches to sentence reduction in property crime.

Finally, the court expressly records its appreciation for the admirable professionalism of the court clerks and ushers, whose conduct ensures the smooth running of daily business despite high caseloads and occasional unexpected challenges such as last-minute applications or adjournments.

In summation, Mr H, the matter before the court is one evidencing deliberate and persistent criminality with cognisable harms extending beyond mere financial loss. While contextual factors — including personal difficulties and mental health concerns — remain relevant, they do not, either individually or collectively, excuse the offence or extinguish the responsibility for lawful conduct.

Having reviewed all material before me, I propose to adjourn this matter for sentence to allow the probation service to complete a detailed pre-sentence
