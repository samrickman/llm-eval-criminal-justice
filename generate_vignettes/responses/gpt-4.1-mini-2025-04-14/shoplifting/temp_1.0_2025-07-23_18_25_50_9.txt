IN THE CROWN COURT AT MILTON BRIDGE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/13456  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. BARNARD  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing pursuant to your conviction on a charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending, which concerns theft from multiple retail premises over a sustained period, has attracted this court’s attention not merely due to the statutory definition of the offence but because of the broader implications it carries for retail safety, community confidence, and the effective use of public resources. The offending spanned a period extending back some eighteen months, with multiple locations affected across the Milton Bridge and neighbouring boroughs.

Procedural History and Observations on Case Progression  
The matter first came to police attention following reports lodged in late 2023 by several local retailers of thefts involving the removal of items without payment. Multi-agency collaboration was instigated early by the Milton Bridge Business Crime Initiative, which facilitated coordination between local police, store security personnel, and the Community Safety Partnership Board. The investigation drew upon a range of evidentiary sources including high-definition CCTV footage, staff interviews, and forensic analysis of recovered property. These investigations are emblematic of the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in handling persistent retail crime: yielding considerable administrative and operational burden.

It bears mention, at this juncture, that investigations such as the one undertaken in this case require the careful navigation of numerous logistical hurdles. High-turnover retail environments provide both opportunity and challenge, given their fluctuating staff rosters, often incomplete incident reporting, and the transitory nature of potential witnesses. Furthermore, store security protocols vary widely, resulting in differing quality and availability of video and transaction records. These factors combine to generate a complex investigative landscape which—while resource-intensive—has enabled the Crown to present a coherent case.

It was necessary for this matter to proceed via the Crown Court under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme instituted some years ago to streamline trial preparation and reduce delays. The case was listed promptly for a plea and trial preparation hearing, although some adjournments were occasioned by the late availability of forensic evidence and the requirement to secure funding for expert reports. Such procedural complexities are lamentably familiar in contemporary criminal justice proceedings and often reflect systemic constraints rather than the conduct of any individual party.

The initial hearing took place on 3 March 2025, as scheduled, at which you entered a plea of not guilty. However, following the Crown’s disclosure of further evidence, including enhanced footage collated from various premises, you altered your plea to guilty at the hearing held on 21 July 2025. It must be recorded, without embellishment, that such late admissions of guilt, while permitted within the bounds of procedural fairness, carry implications for sentencing credit as adjudicated in authorities including R v. Webster [2022] EWCA Crim 1487 and R v. Middleton [2023] EWCA Crim 900, which elucidate the principle that the timing of a plea is proximate to the assessment of its mitigating effect.

The matter was then adjourned pending the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report and a psychiatric evaluation requested by the defence. The delays occasioned by these procedural steps reflect broader systemic issues, most notably the recurrent difficulties in obtaining timely Legal Aid authorisations. It is proper to record here a measured but firm criticism of the Legal Aid Agency’s administration, as repeated delays in approving funding for expert assessments and counsel appointments continue to disrupt the efficient administration of justice and risk depriving defendants of fair trial rights. Such institutional delays, frankly, serve no litigant’s interests and compound the strain on already burdened court timetables.

Public Safety Context and Retail Crime Trends  
We live amid a landscape of mounting concern regarding acquisitive crime, particularly shoplifting, which, though sometimes minimised in public discourse, imparts disproportionately large costs upon small business operators, retail staff, and local communities. The Milton Bridge area has experienced a documented increase in reported retail theft incidents, consistent with national trends reported by the Home Office in its Crime Statistics Bulletin (2024). This rise not only impacts economic viability but also undermines employee morale and prompts reactive security measures that may affect shopper experience.

Similar issues have been explored in the research commissioned by the Retail Trust and Business Crime Reduction Councils, which highlight the multifaceted consequences of retail theft—including increased insurance premiums, lost employment opportunities, and the marginalisation of vulnerable consumers. The court acknowledges and respects the role of victim impact statements submitted in this case, which convey the tangible distress felt by staff regularly required to witness or respond to repeated offending.

On a wider canvas, the court cannot ignore the background of significant operational pressures faced by both the police service and probation authorities. Diminished officer numbers, fluctuating funding allocations, and rising caseloads have led to prioritisation challenges, often relegating acquisitive crime below violent or sexual offences in resource allocation. Nevertheless, consistent, visible enforcement in matters such as shoplifting is central to preserving public confidence and reducing repeat offending. It is a delicate balance to maintain, in a constrained fiscal context.

Correspondingly, partners in the voluntary sector have repeatedly reported increased demand for services supporting individuals in food poverty, housing precarity, and substance misuse—factors that often intertwine with offending behaviour. While such considerations do not absolve criminal acts, they require judicious acknowledgment as part of holistic sentencing processes that seek to reduce reoffending risk through constructive interventions.

It is also pertinent to refer to the manner in which instances of delayed plea entry, such as occurred here, have been approached by appellate courts. The cases R v. Houghton [2024] EWCA Crim 1121 and R v. Seymour [2023] EWCA Crim 1523 confirm that while statutory provisions permit guilty pleas to be made at any time before conviction, the temporal proximity of that plea to the verdict influences sentencing reductions. The rationale rests partly upon procedural economy, partly upon contrition displayed by the defendant. Where pleas are deferred until the final moment, limited credit is justified.

Moreover, this court notes the jurisprudence set forth in R v. Coleman [2020] EWCA Crim 2005, which examined the overlapping considerations of public protection and rehabilitation. That judgment is illuminating for its delineation of how repeated offences within acquisitive crime must be met with sentences calibrated both to deterrence and the opportunity for personal reform.

Historical Context and Legal Framework  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 provides the statutory underpinning for this offence, defining theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner thereof. The Theft Sentencing Guideline (Sentencing Council, 2023 edition) delineates tiers of offending. This guideline enables courts to differentiate between one-off, low-value transactions and offences exhibiting persistence, planning, or significant impact on victims and communities.

While your indictment relates to a consolidated charge, the court will sentence in respect of the entire course of conduct which it represents. This approach is consistent with established sentencing principles, as recognised in R v. Faulkner [2019] EWCA Crim 634, where the Court emphasised that a single charge reflecting multiple incidents may not limit the totality principle.

It is further relevant—though not determinative—to reference the legislative and policy developments over the last decade aimed at reducing retail crime, including statutes enabling exclusion orders and the statutory tasking of Business Crime Reduction Partnerships. Such frameworks bear witness to the recognition by Parliament of the complex interplay between enforcement, prevention, and community engagement.

In comparing this case to other authority, the court notes the decisive custodial outcome in R v. Cuthbertson [2021] EWCA Crim 910. There, the defendant was convicted of multiple counts of theft from retail premises over a cumulative two-year period, with theft values similar to those indicated in the present case. The Court of Appeal endorsed immediate custody in view of recidivism, planning, and adverse community impact.

Alongside these factors, the court will consider mitigation arising from personal circumstances, rehabilitation prospects, and any indication of remorse genuinely expressed through early acceptance of responsibility and engagement with support services.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

While the court is conscious of the economic and psychological stresses that may underpin some offending behaviour, the criminal justice system cannot operate on the premise that such pressures confers immunity or waiver of personal responsibility. The weight accorded to hardship must always be balanced against public protection imperatives and deterrence of similar conduct.

The evidence before me, including the reports supplied by probation and independent psychiatric evaluation, provide some insight into your background, motivations, and mental health status. Regrettably, the psychiatric assessment by Dr Olivia Stanton, consultant forensic psychiatrist, returned findings negating the presence of any recognised mental illness or disorder that would significantly diminish your culpability or impair your capacity for self-regulation. Dr Stanton did, however, note personality traits consistent with impulsivity and moderate substance misuse, which complicate but do not excuse the tenor of your conduct.

Probation’s pre-sentence report further observed a pattern of inconsistent engagement with support services and an absence of stable employment or housing over recent years. These circumstances, while regrettable, neither mandate leniency nor exclude its possibility provided genuine effort towards rehabilitation is demonstrated.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

The patterns elucidated in your pre-sentence and mental health reports are not unusual among repeat acquisitive offenders. It is well-documented that such patterns correlate with social disadvantage, poor educational attainment, and absence of positive peer influence. The court has considered the vast scholarship in criminology concerning these factors but must resist the urge to over-determine causality or to conflate mitigation with exculpation.

Additional procedural observations include that this court was assisted by comprehensive victim impact statements compiled by the Milton Bridge Retail Consortium. These statements credibly attest to the psychological strain experienced by frontline employees, many of whom expressed concern about the risk of escalation or of personal confrontation. Such impacts, while intangible and not quantifiable in monetary terms, weigh materially in the court’s assessment of harm.

I note, in a somewhat related vein, that the defendant’s correspondence contained within the defence bundle is neatly handwritten, legible, and well-structured; this seemingly minor detail underscores a capacity for self-discipline inconsistent with the pattern of thoughtless opportunism often seen in similar matters.

The legal representatives for both parties have conducted themselves with commendable professionalism, notably the prosecution counsel Ms Eleanor Richards and defence counsel Mr Simon Draycott. Their submissions were thorough, carefully reasoned, and provided the court with well-articulated positions on the application of sentencing principles. It is regrettable that delays in the scheduling of forensic and psychiatric reports placed constraints on the timeline for final resolution.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

In preparing the case for sentence, this court took the opportunity to review unrelated but instructive case law, including R v. Beasley [2018] EWCA Crim 1145, a matter involving criminal damage to a church noticeboard, and R v. Andrews [2019] EWCA Crim 2102, concerning fly-tipping in a green belt area. Though these offenses bear no direct bearing upon your conduct, the principles espoused concerning harm assessment and public interest have tangential relevance.

Further, it is worth mentioning that this court is mindful of sentencing trends that underscore the imperative of deterrence for low-level but persistent acquisitive offences. In R v. Higgins [2020] EWCA Crim 1311, the Court emphasised that shoplifting, despite its repetitive low-value nature, carries a risk of escalation and undermines community trust in public order mechanisms.

A recurring concern—which I echo—is the growing volume of such offences within overstretched policing jurisdictions. The diversion of personnel and forensic resources to relatively minor offences risks dilution of focus on more serious criminality, an issue of considerable strategic importance to leadership at both local and national levels.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

It must be made clear that, while this court recognises and respects the historic role of diversion schemes designed to channel offenders into rehabilitative pathways, your documented lack of engagement and the evidence of ongoing commission of similar offending shortly after such interventions must weigh heavily in the sentencing calculus.

Background and Social Context  
In the aggregate, cases of this nature are inexorably linked to broader social challenges. The often-cited correlation between economic deprivation, housing insecurity, and offending conduct is a recurring theme across sentencing remarks at this level. Contemporary scholarship, notably the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies 2025 report ‘Poverty, Policy and Punishment,’ reflects a growing consensus that while structural disadvantage provides perpetuating contexts, it is insufficient to account wholly for offending behaviour.

The court must also take into account the cumulative social costs precipitated by repetitive retail theft — from rising insurance premiums to the closure of local businesses and the resultant erosion of vibrant neighbourhoods. This has been addressed in commentary by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Retail Crime, which underscores the necessity of proportionate enforcement balanced with effective rehabilitative support.

Somewhat tangential but indicative of procedural challenges experienced in matters before this court, it is noted that the attendance of interpreter services on one occasion was delayed by over forty minutes due to administrative error. Though not impacting the present sentence hearing, such delays are regrettable and detract from court efficiency and the dignity of proceedings.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Previous convictions in your record reveal a pattern of similar offences. The court sees four prior theft convictions, with sentences varying from conditional discharge to community penalties, none resulting in custodial sanctions. These prior outcomes suggest a degree of conditional tolerance by the criminal justice system that, in this instance, has failed to deter repeat offending.

In probing deeper, it is worth recalling the rulings in R v. Baxter [2023] EWCA Crim 614, where the imposition of immediate custody was upheld notwithstanding the nominal value involved, predicated on the persistence and effect of the offending.

By contrast, the co-defendant in a related prosecution for offences at Milton Bridge Shopping Centre in 2024 is presently subject to a suspended sentence following successful participation in a Diversionary Programme. Your own refusal or failure to engage fully with such supports is material.

Risk and Rehabilitation Assessment  
The Probation Service’s recent assessment underlines medium-level risk of reoffending, conditioned principally by social factors and impulsivity. It recommends participation in a cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) programme focused on acquisitive offending, alongside referral to substance misuse services. Sadly, your reported sporadic attendance at initial appointments leaves uncertainty as to the likelihood of successful engagement.

Of particular concern is the noted absence of stable accommodation, a significant correlate for reoffending risk. The local housing authority has issued a noise abatement notice in respect of your current residence, compounding instability.

Furthermore, the defendant’s family situation is complex but largely estranged; a letter from your sister, Ms Bernadine, has been filed but provides little in the way of mitigating detail. She reports a difficult upbringing but is unable to comment on recent conduct.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

In preparing these remarks, this court has reviewed correspondence provided by the West Milton Soup Kitchen, a voluntary organisation that offers front-line support to vulnerable adults. Their perspective, while broadly supportive, highlights the challenges they face in contact with individuals who exhibit low engagement and frequent reoffending.

Such observations are critical reminders that any sentencing disposition must balance deterrence, punishment, and realistic prospects of rehabilitation.

Conclusion and Directions  
For the reasons articulated above, the court regards the offending as egregious in its persistence, exhibited without evident regard for previous admonitions or diversionary interventions. There is a clear pattern of behaviour defined by opportunism, planning, and wilful disregard for the impact your actions have upon victims and community confidence.

Having considered all material, including the pre-sentence report, psychiatric report, victim impact statements, and submissions of counsel, I decline to make any definitive sentencing order at this time. In conformity with best practice, I shall defer sentence pending further assessment and a final report exploring the feasibility and suitability of structured community interventions capable of addressing your offending-related behaviour, financial instability, and associated risks.

This hearing has proceeded in open court, located in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Milton Bridge. I expressly record my thanks to Ms Eleanor Richards, representing the Crown, and to Mr Simon Draycott, who appears for you pursuant to a Legal Aid representation order. I also acknowledge the hospital trust’s forensic psychiatric team for their timely report.

The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transcribed and safeguarded according to Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant retains the right of appeal pursuant to sections 108 and 112 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days from the date of sentencing. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 have been engaged.

These are the orders of the court.
