IN THE CROWN COURT AT GRANTHAM  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/03745  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. FAIRBAIRN  
Filed: 18 September 2026  

Mr H, you stand before the court today for sentence in respect of offences of theft by shoplifting, contrary to the provisions of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, as charged and admitted, extends over a protracted period commencing in the early months of 2024 and continuing into 2026, encompassing multiple incidents in different commercial retail locations across the greater Lincolnshire area. The prosecution advances a consolidated charge representing a course of conduct characterised by the persistent acquisition of goods valued cumulatively in excess of several hundred pounds.

Procedural History  
The matter was first listed before the Magistrates’ Court at Lincoln on 12 February 2026, following the defendant’s arrest on 5 February 2026. The arrest was the culmination of an investigation orchestrated by the Lincolnshire Retail Crime Reduction Unit and supported by the Combined Policing Partnership, which involved surveillance, liaison with local retailers, and analysis of security footage. Early applications for bail were made and remanded on conditions to reside at a nominated address and observe a curfew between 18:00 and 06:00 hours. On 20 March 2026, the case was formally committed to this Crown Court pursuant to the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme, reflecting the complexity of evidence, volume of associated material, and the need for judicial scrutiny at the higher tier of the criminal justice system.

It is pertinent to note, as this court observes with increasing frequency, the debilitating impact on case progression posed by systemic resourcing shortages in both prosecutorial and defence frameworks. The Lincolnshire Legal Aid Consortium repeatedly flagged difficulties securing timely funding approvals for expert reports, leading to adjournments on 30 March, 18 May, and again on 7 July 2026. Such intermissions, while unfortunate, are a lamentable but now familiar feature of contemporary criminal litigation; they detract from procedural efficiency and inevitably prolong uncertainty for all concerned, not least victims and witnesses.

The plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 1 August 2026, at which time you entered a guilty plea to the consolidated charge. This plea was tendered on the day fixed for trial, following the service of voluminous disclosure material comprising over 3,000 pages, inclusive of witness statements, digital surveillance evidence, and forensic reports. The Crown has advanced submissions on the timing of the plea, inviting the court to apply a modest reduction in sentencing credit in accordance with established appellate guidelines.

Late guilty pleas in acquisitive crime cases, such as this, merit particular consideration. It is well-established, as articulated in R v. Sedgwick [2020] EWCA Crim 1441, that the timing of the guilty plea is paramount in determining the appropriate credit for early acceptance of responsibility. Furthermore, in accordance with R v. Warburton [2022] EWCA Crim 668, credit may be diminished where pleas are entered at the eleventh hour, particularly following exhaustive preparations by the prosecution and substantial victim and witness distress.

The court’s docket is by now replete with cases exhibiting this modus operandi: defendants electing to test the weight of evidence over many months, frequently exhausting the patience and resilience of all parties, only to capitulate when the prospect of acquittal disappears. While the law rightly permits such a course, it is incumbent upon the court to recognise its systemic cost and ensure that credit discounts are applied in a manner that properly advances the interests of justice.

Before examining the facts of the offending, it is appropriate to record the court’s thanks to those engaged in the investigative stage. The London Retail Security Alliance provided valuable operational support, notwithstanding the geographic distance and jurisdictional complexities inherent in multi-force coordination. Additionally, the administrative teams within the Lincolnshire Business Crime Forum facilitated the collation of impact statements spanning six premises. Their commitment deserves commendation amidst an adverse funding climate marked by austerity.

Similarly, the court is mindful of the ongoing pressures faced by the Lincolnshire Probation Service. Staffing shortages and increasingly complex caseloads have strained the delivery of community-based interventions and rehabilitation programmes. The court has noted applications for urgent funding to expand programmes of cognitive behavioural therapy specifically targeting acquisitive offending, an area of continued concern nationally. These challenges, and the attendant risks they impose on effective offender management, qualify a measured and circumspect approach to sentencing in cases such as the present.

Legal Context  
For completeness, I remind myself of the statutory and guideline framework applicable to this offence. Theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains a fundamental statutory provision encapsulating the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving. The Sentencing Council guideline on theft offences, last amended in 2023, guides sentencing in cases involving shoplifting to reflect the value of goods taken, any aggravating or mitigating features, and the offender’s culpability and history.

The guideline emphasises that persistent or premeditated offending which has a demonstrable impact on victims or the community warrants a proportionate response. Among the aggravating factors relevant here are the repeated nature of the conduct, the targeting of vulnerable staff members, and failure to respond to prior interventions or diversionary schemes.

The court has also reviewed jurisprudence illuminating related considerations. R v. Willoughby [2021] EWCA Crim 1092 illustrated the relevance of custodial sentencing even in the absence of direct violence, particularly where repeated breaches of trust undermine community confidence in retail security. R v. Fletcher [2019] EWCA Crim 1387 highlighted the significance of the vulnerability of victims, noting that retail assistants often experience anxiety and distress disproportionate to the value of goods stolen. These cases inform but do not determine the judgment in the present matter, which turns principally on the facts before me.

Further, I have borne in mind the principles guiding credit for guilty pleas as detailed in R v. Parker [2022] EWCA Crim 267, cautioning against automatic tariff reductions where pleas are delayed until the eve of trial. The court recalls that sentencing credit is a concession reflecting not only remorse but the conservation of court and witness resources, and should not become a procedural stratagem.

While it is tempting to delve at length into the forensic strands of the prosecution case, it is worth observing the ever-growing role of digital evidence in retail crime. The forensic services division’s workload has markedly increased, mirroring national trends. The analysis of CCTV, body-worn camera footage, and mobile phone data demands both specialised expertise and significant time, imposing further burdens on public funds. It is within this broader context that the present offences were investigated.

I also wish to comment—though strictly ancillary—that the defendant’s sister, presently engaged in unrelated proceedings in the Nottingham Youth Court, has provided a personal statement expressing concern at his recent behaviour and housing instability. While family circumstances inevitably form part of a wider social backdrop, they do not detract from judicial focus on individual responsibility.

Nor does the court afford weight to conjecture on the defendant’s extended family, some members of whom were reported to have prior convictions for benefit fraud and unrelated public order offences. These matters remain outside the ambit of this trial and sentencing exercise.

Recent statistical reports from the National Retail Federation disclose a worrying increment in shoplifting incidents, particularly in urban areas, with consequential impacts on insurance premiums, pricing structures, and staff welfare. It is an unfortunate reality that many local retailers now operate under heightened security protocols, including covert in-store monitoring and liaison with law enforcement. Such adaptations represent both practical necessity and tacit recognition of the persistent threat posed by repeat offenders.

Facts of the Offending  
The facts, as found at trial or admitted pleading, may be summarised as follows:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

During multiple incidents, the defendant utilised several methods to avoid detection, including the use of concealment bags, periodical visits during off-peak hours, and feigned disinterest to mislead staff. Surveillance footage shows a consistent appearance, wearing a distinctive blue jacket on at least four occasions, supporting witness identifications.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

The choice of premises was non-random, predominantly consisting of small independent retailers and community-run pharmacies, some operating on slim margins and employing often solitary staff members. Employees gave evidence describing heightened anxiety, disruptive shift changes, and in one instance, sickness absence attributable to workplace stress induced by repeated encounters with the defendant.

It is regrettable that the defendant repeatedly failed to avail himself of earlier diversion schemes and community resolution opportunities offered following previous minor offences. The Crown submit that the persistent nature of offending reveals a disregard not only for the law but for community standards and social cohesion.

This course of conduct culminated in loss, damage, and frustration well beyond mere monetary value. Retailers reported a chilling effect on staff morale and increased operational costs associated with enhanced security measures, including hiring additional personnel and installing physical deterrents.

Expert and Risk Assessments  
The court received a comprehensive psychiatric report authored by Dr Samantha Fielding, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, whose assessment concluded that you suffer from no identifiable mental illness but exhibit marked impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, compounded by mild dependent use of prescribed anxiolytics. The report notes your acknowledgment of financial pressures but critiques a general lack of proactive engagement with support providers. You failed to consistently attend appointments offered by the Lincolnshire Integrated Mental Health Team, referring instead to transient accommodation providers and community groups.

It is, I must say, a source of frustration that public services crafted to assist persons in your position — including homelessness outreach programmes, financial advisory clinics hosted by local charities, and employment retraining initiatives — have received only intermittent attention. These agencies operate under significant fiscal strain and serve populations frequently in far greater distress. Their preparedness to aid must, respectfully, be met by a reciprocal commitment.

As noted in the Probation Service pre-sentence report, which draws on extensive background checks and interviews, you have four previous convictions for similar offences, the most recent being a conditional discharge imposed in 2021. Your current social circumstances are complex. You have reported ongoing housing instability, relying on occasional stays in emergency shelters within the Grantham area. There is no evidence of gang or organised criminal connections. The report also highlights a lack of stable employment history and limited family support, both of which bear upon risk assessment.

The probation officer’s evaluation indicates a medium risk of reoffending with potential risk of further acquisitive crimes absent effective intervention. Recommended measures include enrolment in a Cognitive Skills Programme focusing on decision-making and impulse control, alongside engagement with local support services addressing housing and financial management.

I note that you declined an offer to participate in a voluntary offending behaviour group arranged by the Lincolnshire Adult Education Service. This reticence underscores the imperative of a sentencing framework that balances punitive elements with rehabilitative support, designed to protect both the public and assist in your reconstruction of lawful living.

Discussion and Sentencing Approach  
The court is acutely cognisant of the burden imposed on the small businesses affected by your offending. The cumulative effect on employees’ mental well-being, operational costs, and community confidence is significant. While the offences do not involve violence or threats, the psychological toll on vulnerable staff must not be underestimated.

Your late guilty plea reduces but does not extinguish culpability credit. It followed substantial prosecution preparation and witness mobilisation, meaning the saving of court time and distress is comparatively limited. Consistent with authority in R v. Ebner [2021] EWCA Crim 2031, the court will apply a proportionate reduction in sentence.

I further remind myself of the principles set out in the Sentencing Council’s Overarching Principles Guidance. The sentence must be commensurate with harm caused, the offender’s culpability, and potential for rehabilitation. Community sentences carry merits where compliance is probable, but multiple prior convictions and failure to respond to earlier interventions diminish confidence in such an approach.

It is also relevant to note the wider societal context. The rise in street homelessness and associated vulnerabilities has placed considerable pressure on local authorities and voluntary organisations alike. Compounding this, mental health service waiting lists have escalated dramatically, with some clients enduring delays of several months. This reality challenges the court’s capacity to impose sentences that simultaneously deliver public protection and sustainable offender engagement.

In addition, I acknowledge correspondence from the Grantham Retailers’ Association, highlighting the economic impact of repeated thefts in small town centres. These matters, whilst indirectly relevant, contextualise the environment in which such offences occur.

Finally, I refer to the substantial case law reiterated above to guide the sentence range and credit calibration. Past decisions affirm the need for deterrent sentencing in repeat shoplifting cases, balanced by appropriate rehabilitative focus.

Conclusion  
The court will direct that a detailed pre-sentence report be obtained forthwith, encompassing an updated risk assessment and recommendations for community-based resources or custodial requirements. This report should also consider any potential for combining punitive and remedial elements, including unpaid work, accredited programmes, and housing support liaison.

As always, sentencing in these matters requires sensitivity to both individual circumstances and the overarching public interest. The matter will be adjourned to a date to be fixed upon receipt and consideration of the pre-sentence report.

Today's sentencing hearing has proceeded in open court, with all parties present and duly represented. I extend thanks to Ms Grace Lombard, who appeared for the Crown, and to Mr Ali Hassan, counsel instructed on behalf of the defendant. I acknowledge the court staff and ushers for their diligence in managing the court listing and administration despite recurrent pressures on resources.
