IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTWELL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. 325/2025/BR17  
Sentencing Remarks — His Honour Judge A. G. THURLOW  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court tasked with the solemn responsibility of receiving sentence in respect of offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, namely shoplifting from multiple retail premises over a period extending across late 2023 and into early 2025. The offending is characterised by a course of conduct involving repeated instances of retail theft which, while individually of modest monetary value, cumulatively denote a planned and persistent pattern of criminality.

Procedural History and Case Progression  
You were arrested on 11 March 2025 following an investigative operation conducted predominantly by the Hartwell City Central Police Division, working in concert with the Hartwell Retail Crime Prevention Board, a consortium of local businesses and law enforcement aimed at combatting retail acquisitive crime. This multi-agency partnership endeavours to collate intelligence, share incident data, and coordinate responses to what, collectively, are viewed as symptoms of broader social and economic challenges.  

The investigation, as this court is aware through frequent dealings with such matters, is resource-intensive. It entailed the painstaking assembly and review of multiple hours of security footage from five distinct retail outlets, alongside detailed interview transcripts and physical evidence recovery protocols. The utilisation of digital forensics was integral, including analysis of electronic point-of-sale data cross-referenced against CCTV timelines. Such scrutiny is not standard for all low-level offences but became justified here by the repetitive nature of the alleged offending.  

It is hardly news that policing resources remain stretched to near breaking point, particularly at the borough level. Officers are regularly redeployed to urgent matters, responding to violent crime and public disorder. Against this background, the diversion of assets to protracted shoplifting investigations represents a difficult but necessary prioritisation. It conveys the seriousness with which such offending is regarded locally, not least in light of the cumulative effect upon vulnerable retail staff and small businesses.  

A plea and case management hearing took place on 30 June 2025. At that hearing, defence counsel entered a not guilty plea and requested a further adjournment to instruct medical reports pursuant to potential mitigation linked to mental health considerations. This followed preliminary psychiatric screening by the Liaison and Diversion Service, which suggested emotional distress and signs of an anxiety disorder. The court granted this request, mindful both of the procedural imperative to ensure fair trial rights and the therapeutic possibilities that early assessment may permit.

The assessment undertaken by Dr Pauline Verity, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, was comprehensive and recent, dated 4 September 2025. Her report, appended to the defence bundle, articulates a diagnosis of moderate Generalised Anxiety Disorder with co-morbid borderline personality traits. The report is detailed and professionally composed, containing clinical observations and psychometric test results alongside a review of social history.  

Dr Verity concludes that while the disorder in question has undoubtedly exerted adverse effects on your emotional regulation and stress tolerance, it does not typically manifest in behaviours amounting to criminality per se, but rather might contribute indirectly to difficulties in coping with external pressures. Of particular note is a recommendation that you engage with community mental health services upon release, with a view to stabilising your emotional state and thereby potentially reducing the risk of recidivism.

It is worth recording, for transparency, that this court has observed a marked increase in referrals to Liaison and Diversion teams over the past four years—a reflection both of greater professional awareness and the grim rise in mental health vulnerabilities among those who come into contact with the criminal justice system. The system, however, remains heavily burdened, with waiting lists extending into months across the region. Such realities are neither a cause for judicial comment nor a justification for delay but constitute a practical backdrop to sentencing considerations, insofar as they may affect the availability and efficacy of post-sentence interventions.  

Alongside the psychiatric assessment, a pre-sentence report was commissioned at my direction to provide a fuller picture of your personal circumstances, prior offending history, and prospects for rehabilitation. Your probation officer, Ms Felicity Pearson, has compiled a thorough and reflective document, dated 10 September 2025, following several interviews and consultation with ancillary agencies. The report paints a picture of significant social instability, recurring financial insecurity, and unstable housing arrangements.  

Notably, Ms Pearson remarks on your incomplete engagement with offered support services, despite consistent outreach efforts. This is particularly salient given the availability of schemes targeting acquisitive offenders, designed to address underlying issues of substance misuse and unemployment.  

In addition, correspondence from the regional branch of Safe Paths—a charity specialising in homelessness support—indicates that you were briefly accommodated in emergency hostel provision, but your tenancy was suspended for non-compliance with house rules. Their letter expresses cautious hope that any court-ordered community disposition might coincide with renewed engagement, but also emphasises the extent of their resources and the fragility of their client's positions generally.

It is, regrettably, a recurring observation that defendants charged with repeated shoplifting offences often present with complex needs unmet by chronically overstretched services operating at the margin of effective reach. The strain imposed on charitable, voluntary, and statutory providers cannot be overstated. Demand exceeds supply, and choices must be made daily about whom to prioritise or refer to awaiting panels.  

The Crown has delivered its final submissions with succinct clarity, emphasising the seriousness of the offending and the necessity of an effective sentence promoting both deterrence and rehabilitation. Ms Lorna Bancroft, appearing on behalf of the prosecution, referenced the evidence as “strong and coherent,” highlighting the pattern of calculated thefts and repeated disregard for informal warnings and diversionary opportunities.  

In contrast, defence counsel Mr Gregor Mills accentuated your difficult personal circumstances, the existence of psychiatric vulnerabilities, and your late change of plea to guilty. He sought leniency in respect of the guilty plea discount, underscoring your purported remorse and the potential for structured community-based interventions.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Turning to case law bearing on these issues, it is appropriate to highlight the continuing evolution of principles governing sentencing in acquisitive crime. The Sentencing Council guideline for theft offences, issued in 2022, remains the definitive framework. It balances factors such as value stolen, planning and sophistication, the impact on victims, and the offender’s personal circumstances. A course of conduct involving multiple offences attracts enhanced consideration.  

The case of R v. Pearce [2023] EWCA Crim 1124 is instructive. There, the defendant engaged in a series of shoplifting episodes targeting multiple premises, with subsequent appeals clarifying the scope for discounting credit when guilty pleas are entered late in proceedings. The Court reasserted that whilst a late plea is entitled to some reduction, it must bear the hallmarks of genuine remorse and a meaningful acceptance of responsibility. Mere tactical calculation is insufficient.  

Similarly, in R v. Donovan [2024] EWCA Crim 523, the Court emphasised the relevance of mental health issues in sentencing, articulating the need to carefully weigh evidence of disorder or disability against the gravity of the offending conduct and wider public protection requirements. That case involved a defendant suffering from schizoaffective disorder who had been convicted of arson, highlighting the delicate balance between clinical needs and custodial requirements.

You, Mr H, do not suffer from such severe illness, nor do the offences encompass violence or threat. Nonetheless, the principle that psychiatric and psychological factors inform sentencing remains apposite. Equally pertinent are the observations on patterns of repeated offending, described in R v. Elstone [2022] EWCA Crim 1609, which affirmed the legitimacy of reflecting the persistence of acquisitive crime in sentence severity.  

I also take judicial notice of the fact that the Hartwell Crown Court, established in 1984, has been modernised recently with updated courtroom technology, including high-definition video-link equipment, improved security measures, and adaptations for enhanced accessibility. This serves the interests of efficient justice but also allocates resources away from frontline policing or victim support services, underscoring the broader systemic challenges.

A brief word on victim impact. Input was provided in writing by several retail managers and frontline staff affected by your activities. While the pecuniary loss was limited, the non-material consequences—heightened anxiety, disrupted working patterns, and eroded trust—were profound. Some employees reported feeling unsafe or reluctant to work alone, with one noting a changed roster to avoid vulnerability during peak periods.  

Though some of the victim statements express sympathy over perceived socioeconomic hardship, none diminish the damage caused by your repeated unlawful conduct.  

Profoundly, such offences have an outsized impact on small independent businesses, which operate on thin margins and depend heavily on the goodwill and safety of their employees. It is not the function of the court to adjudicate on commercial practices, but the evidence amply demonstrates the systemic consequences of persistent theft.

Turning to ancillary matters, this court is compelled to note with regret the ongoing procedural delays occasioned by Legal Aid Agency processing. The initial application for funding to instruct a forensic psychologist was submitted on 5 April, but approval was only granted on 18 May after multiple remittals and resubmissions. Such administrative lag is symptomatic of wider systemic deficiencies, placing undue strain on all parties.  

This is neither criticism of the Legal Aid staff, who operate under difficult conditions, nor an excusing factor for the defendant.
