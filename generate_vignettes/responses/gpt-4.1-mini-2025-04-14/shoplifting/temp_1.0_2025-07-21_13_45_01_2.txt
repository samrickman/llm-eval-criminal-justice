IN THE CROWN COURT AT BELMONT  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. T2025/13897  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge B. K. Feathers  
Filed: 17 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to receive sentence following your conviction related to the offence of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, as consolidated in the indictment before this court. The offending conduct took place intermittently over a period of approximately eighteen months, primarily concentrated within the commercial districts of Belmont and its surrounding boroughs.

Preliminary and Procedural Background  
The initial investigation began in late 2023 when local police units, responding to an increase in theft reports, liaised with the Belmont Retail Crime Reduction Partnership (BRCRP). As is often the case, these partnerships aim to establish collaborative frameworks involving retailers, the police, community safety officers, and local government entities to monitor, prevent, and respond to repeated theft patterns. These initiatives, while well-intentioned, often struggle under the weight of limited resources and administrative fatigue. Yet, in this case, the BRCRP played a more effective role than is sometimes observed, as evidenced by timely incident reports and coordinated data sharing with the police's intelligence unit.

Your arrest came on 12 April 2025, following a foot patrol officer's observations coupled with corroborative CCTV footage, with the assistance of retail security teams and investigative officers from the Belmont Borough Crime Unit. The arrest was the result of a several-week-long surveillance operation requiring the deployment of both covert human intelligence and electronic monitoring techniques.

It is worth noting the broader operational context in which such crimes are investigated: the Constant Strain on Law Enforcement For Low-level Offending. Policing resources remain stretched due to the prioritisation of violent and organised crime; yet, the cumulatively disruptive nature of persistent shoplifting cannot be ignored. This has a significant knock-on effect on the morale of frontline staff and the accessibility of justice for those affected by sustained petty crime.

The administrative journey through the court system was occasionally hampered by the well-documented challenges of Legal Aid bureaucracy. Representation for the defence was provisionally granted under Legal Aid Schedule B incremental fees but experienced delays following the initial submission for expert psychiatric assistance. I note and regret that these procedural challenges, although ultimately resolved, lengthened the timeline and imposed unnecessary strain on all parties involved. The defensive team’s efforts to secure timely instruction of a qualified forensic psychologist were delayed by protracted correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency, exacerbat­ing the general sense of inefficiency in publicly funded legal support services.

It is acknowledged that the case followed the Criminal Procedure Rules’ Better Case Management (BCM) framework, which was introduced to expedite case progression and improve overall timeliness. The BCM’s objectives — to reduce late disclosures and adjournments — align closely with the goal of safeguarding the interests of both defendants and victims alike. Although this matter adhered broadly to the indicative timeframes, it must be noted that occasions of adjournment occurred due to defence applications to adduce further evidence, including character references and expert testimony.

Crown and Defence Submissions  
At the sentencing hearing, Ms Emilia Hartwell appeared on behalf of the Crown. Her submissions emphasised the cumulative impact of your conduct upon retail staff and the wider community, pointing to evidence which suggested that the offending was both deliberate and repeated, with minimal sign of remorse or rehabilitation prior to this conviction.  

Mr Oscar Plumb, representing you under a legal aid order, submitted that the mitigating factors in your favour — including your current housing instability, absence of serious prior convictions beyond a limited acquisitive crime record, personal difficulties elucidated in psychiatric reports, and your recent guilty plea — warranted consideration of a community-based sentence with attendant rehabilitative support. He pressed, moreover, for the court to fully explore non-custodial avenues by way of deferred sentencing pending a comprehensive pre-sentence report.

Unfortunately, the defence plea was not entered at the earliest practicable opportunity. This court is mindful, as emphasised in R v Calloway [2021] EWCA Crim 1742, that the timing of a plea is a salient factor in determining the extent of sentencing credit for mitigation. Late admissions of guilt, while welcomed as indicia of eventual acceptance of responsibility, must be carefully scrutinised to assess their genuineness and impact on procedural economy.

Victim Impact and Community Response  
This court has received written statements from several retail staff affected by your offending. While no physical violence was reported or evidenced, the persistent anxiety and diminished sense of safety among employees cannot be disregarded. Indeed, one shop manager noted that several altered their working hours and duties in response to your repeated presence, marking a tangible disruption to their professional and personal lives.  

The Belmont Community Outreach Project, a charitable organisation providing assistance to individuals with histories of acquisitive crime, submitted observations underscoring the challenges faced by shopworkers in the borough. Their letter highlighted the “silent toll” of such offences on low-paid employees who, while not physically harmed, suffer emotional strain and feelings of vulnerability. Similar themes resonate through criminological literature on the secondary impact of property crime, where psychological consequences often persist beyond the immediate incident.

Such victim testimony warrants solemn reflection on the ripple effects of offending beyond mere financial valuation.

Legal Context and Case Law Referenced  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the principal statutory provision under which your offence is charged, defining theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intent to permanently deprive. The applicable Sentencing Council guideline for theft offences — updated in April 2024 — establishes a framework balancing the value of goods, the frequency of offending, aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and culpability arising from both modus operandi and impact upon victims.

The court is cognisant of precedent emphasising the significance of repetitive offending in the custodial threshold. In R v. Donnelly [2022] EWCA Crim 1983, the Court underscored that persistent shoplifting offences, even of relatively low value individually, may cumulatively justify immediate custody on grounds of public protection and deterrence. Equally instructive is the decision in R v. Mercer [2019] EWCA Crim 1157, which clarified that earlier convictions, community resolution outcomes, and prior diversions bear heavily upon the proportionality of sentencing.

It is worth mentioning, albeit tangentially, the Court of Appeal’s observations in R v. Farrell [2018] EWCA Crim 560 concerning possession of bladed articles near educational premises. While bearing no factual relation to your case, that judgment serves as a reminder that proximity to vulnerable environments and potential to cause harm can elevate otherwise straightforward offences into heightened categories of culpability. Similarly, R v. Tyrrell [2020] EWCA Crim 1286, dealing with aggravated trespass during a public demonstration, provides an example of how the court must parse the defendant’s intent, context, and conduct to calibrate suitable responses.

It is no part of this court to conflate such unrelated authorities with the present factual and legal matrix; rather, they provide a broader jurisprudential context against which sentencing discretion is exercised.

Psychiatric and Probation Reports  
Dr Simone Lake, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, conducted a comprehensive assessment at my direction. Her report, dated 30 September 2025, is detailed and professionally formatted. She notes that, while you are not diagnosed with any major mental illness, certain personality traits consistent with impulsivity, low frustration tolerance, and mild depressive symptoms were observed. Of note is the absence of diagnosable dependency syndromes, although a history of episodic recreational substance use was referenced.

Dr Lake emphasises a history of inconsistent engagement with offered health and social services, including initial contact with community mental health liaison teams but subsequent withdrawal before planned interventions could commence. This is regrettable, given the evidenced potential benefits of early psychosocial support in similar cases. The report cautiously states that your past engagement with structured rehabilitation programmes was minimal, and that any sustainable desistance would require consistent multi-agency cooperation.

In parallel, the Community Rehabilitation Services submitted a pre-sentence report. The probation officer assigned, Ms Lydia Morris, outlines a medium risk of reoffending related primarily to acquisitive behaviour, with low risk of serious harm to others. Ms Morris provides a considered view advocating for a comprehensive package of support, including cognitive behavioural therapy aimed at addressing underlying criminogenic attitudes and life skills coaching to enhance financial stability and self-efficacy.

It is observed that housing uncertainty, while a significant stressor, cannot excuse ongoing offending. The report recommends exploration of supported living arrangements pending rehabilitative progress.

This court is deeply conscious of the systemic pressures experienced by statutory and voluntary agencies alike. NHS mental health services remain under acute strain, with extended waiting times commonplace, a factor which sometimes undermines the timeliness of interventions. Similarly, probation caseloads have increased markedly in recent years, limiting the individualised support that can realistically be provided. Voluntary sector organisations tasked with community reintegration frequently operate at the margins of financial and operational sustainability.

Whilst these external factors may provide context, they cannot serve as justification for repeated breaches of law and social trust.

The facts of the offending, as established at trial and through police evidence, demonstrate a clear pattern of deliberate theft, often undertaken during busier periods when staff were engaged elsewhere, and involving the concealment of goods in personal clothing or bags. The selected items were typically of modest monetary value individually but cumulatively significant. Security footage demonstrates familiarity with store layouts and precautionary measures to prevent detection.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

Further exhibits include testimony from retail loss prevention officers detailing your conduct on multiple occasions, including attempts to interfere with electronic article surveillance (EAS) systems and refusal to submit to voluntary searches upon exit.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

While no violent or threatening behaviour was recorded or alleged, the negative psychological effects on staff were profound, with some employees requiring time off work citing stress-related illness.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

The cumulative economic effect extended beyond retail shrinkage to include increased insurance premiums for affected stores and investments in additional security measures, thereby burdensome to small business owners.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Nonetheless, there was no evidence that you were part of an organised group or network targeting retail outlets, nor was there any suggestion of threats made to staff or associates. The offending appeared individual and motivated predominantly by personal financial pressures.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

You have no known gang affiliations, and no indication that you used firearms, weapons, or other coercive devices in relation to the offences in question.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Prior to the commission of the current offences, you were subject to a community resolution relating to an unrelated incident of criminal damage, which bears no substantive relationship to the present.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

On previous occasions, you have engaged in similar theft-related offending, for which you received conditional discharges and warnings, yet you appear to have persisted despite these sanctions.

Considerations for Sentencing and Public Interest  
The court is awarded a degree of latitude in the application of the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline, especially given the nature of the offence as representative of a course of conduct. While monetary value is a significant factor, it is but one element among others relating to impact, persistence, and personal circumstances.

Of concern is the evident lack of sustained rehabilitation so far, the minimal engagement with support services prior to this prosecution, and the burden your conduct placed upon victim businesses and individuals in the community.

The function of sentence in such cases is multifaceted: to protect the public, to provide just punishment, to deter both you and others, and to encourage your rehabilitation through appropriate interventions.

The court acknowledges the societal context of persistent homelessness and housing rough sleepers, a challenge faced by many urban areas including Belmont. While it is true that complex health, social, and economic difficulties contribute to vulnerability, these realities do not excuse nor ameliorate the decision to commit theft to meet basic needs. There are myriad public and charitable services available which continue to struggle to meet demand — services which you have been extended but reportedly declined.

The Legal Aid Agency’s challenges in funding expert reports and supporting defence teams remain a matter of ongoing concern. Such delays can inadvertently prolong proceedings and complicate access to justice. They also risk undermining confidence in the criminal justice system’s capacity to act with fairness and efficiency.

Your decision to enter a plea only when the strength of evidence became incontrovertible points to strategic considerations rather than genuine contrition, reducing the credit due for your admission.

In reaching sentence, I take full account of the report’s recommendations for community interventions but remain mindful of the need to safeguard victims and denounce offending which undermines public trust.

I reserve final judgement on sentence until receipt of the updated pre-sentence report, which will revisit your engagement with services and assess the feasibility of a community order incorporating rehabilitative and punitive elements.

As a brief tangential note, it is apposite to mention the impact of COVID-19 on retail crime patterns. Though the pandemic is no longer the immediate concern it was, its legacy remains. The shift towards online shopping, the increased economic precarity, and changes in retail staffing all contributed
