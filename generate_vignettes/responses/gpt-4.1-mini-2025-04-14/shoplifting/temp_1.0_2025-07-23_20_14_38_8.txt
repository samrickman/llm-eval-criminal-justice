IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/14953  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. R. Wilcomb  
Filed: 17 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentencing in relation to a charge under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, concerning a course of conduct engaged in over an extended period, whereby you were found to have committed offences of theft from retail premises. The offending, as alleged and ultimately admitted, took place predominantly within the Manchester city centre and surrounding district shopping areas during the course of the preceding eighteen months.

Procedural Background  
This matter came before this court after a somewhat protracted investigative and procedural timeline, not uncommon in cases involving serial low-level acquisitive offending. You were first arrested on 12 February 2025 after a coordinated policing operation involving the Greater Manchester Police Retail Crime Unit, supported by local business crime safety teams across the city. The arrest culminated an investigative phase utilising CCTV collation, victim witness statements, and forensic examination of items seized from your person and your residence. The investigative efforts were necessarily detailed; the gradual accrual of evidence exemplifies the challenges faced by authorities in assembling cohesive cases where isolated incidents initially appear unconnected and minor.

Significant police resource was allocated to this investigation, reflecting the strategic priority afforded to retail crime by local enforcement agencies. A notable procedural feature in this case was the involvement of the Manchester Business Crime Forum, an inter-agency body designed to promote information-sharing, intelligence-led policing, and activist engagement between businesses and statutory partners. The forum's efforts resulted in prompt collation of incident reports and a coordinated victim impact liaison strategy, which facilitated a more comprehensive evidential basis. While such cooperation is ideal, it often encounters logistical barriers including inconsistent data sharing protocols and resource limitations across partner agencies. In this instance, however, the forum’s contribution was commendable and expedited core evidential processes.

I observe at this point that the time taken for the matter to progress to sentencing was elongated by a series of factors external to the case's foundational details. In particular, delays were occasioned by the late provision of legal aid funding to instruct an independent forensic psychologist, which involved repeated applications and correspondence between the defence solicitors and the Legal Aid Agency’s regional office. Such administrative delays are regrettable and place considerable strain on the timely disposal of cases. This court remains deeply concerned about the recurrent inefficiencies and procedural hurdles presented by the current legal aid framework, which have a direct and prejudicial impact upon justice. It is imperative that system reforms continue apace to keep pace with evolving demands.

Notwithstanding these procedural vicissitudes, this court acknowledges the professionalism and diligence demonstrated by the parties involved. I wish to record my appreciation for the thoroughness of the prosecution team, led by Ms Felicity Glover, prosecuting counsel, and the steadfast defence representation of Mr Lucas Chandler, solicitor advocate. Both counsel have presented their submissions with appropriate clarity and commitment, reflective of the seriousness with which this case deserves to be treated. The trial preparations were conducted in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules and the Better Case Management (BCM) standards established to streamline proceedings and promote case readiness within set timeframes.

It is a sadly familiar pattern in this jurisdiction — and indeed across the country — that defendants in low-level acquisitive crime cases frequently delay admission of guilt until much later in the process, often only just ahead of trial. This court must emphasise that the right to a fair trial is sacrosanct and duly respected. Equally, however, the courts are mindful of the burden this places on witnesses, victims, court resources, and public funds. The well-rehearsed principle, endorsed in R v Chapman [2019] EWCA Crim 348 and other authority, is that credit for a guilty plea is not automatic but contingent upon its timing and the accompanying demonstration of genuine remorse. It should be noted that pleas entered only when conviction becomes inevitable attract a commensurately reduced discount on sentence.

Before detailing the circumstances of the offending, I pause to note that this court is not convened to offer commentary on social policy or public health planning. Yet, it would be remiss in a matter such as this not to acknowledge some of the broader social challenges impacting the communities we serve. Rising levels of street homelessness, financial hardship aggravated by inflationary pressures, and the immense strain on mental health services all inevitably permeate the lives of those found before this court. Recent reports by the Manchester Homeless Action Network highlight an increase in rough sleeping and related antisocial behaviours within the city centre, factors which complicate the nexus of vulnerability and criminality. These contextual factors, while notable, neither mitigate responsibility nor excuse unlawful conduct. I mention them only to provide a fuller picture of the environment in which these events transpired.

The facts of this case demonstrate that the offending was neither random nor haphazard. You engaged in a deliberate pattern of conduct aimed at circumventing store security measures and exploiting moments of staff distraction. The methods employed, including the use of concealed receptacles and apparent familiarity with store layouts, bespeak a degree of planning inconsistent with mere impulsivity.

It bears mentioning that the professionalism of store staff in reporting incidents and providing detailed accounts greatly contributed to the investigative findings. Letters of support submitted from the Manchester Retailers’ Association commend the patience and perseverance of local shop workers, many of whom operate in challenging conditions with minimal support. Changes implemented by these businesses — including the installation of new alarm systems and staff rotations to reduce lone working — evidence the real-world effects of persistent theft on frontline employees.

A plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 29 August 2025, during which you initially entered a not guilty plea. Following the disclosure of further evidence, including enhanced CCTV and forensic reports, a late guilty plea was entered on 10 September 2025. Such tardiness is not uncommon, but it carries implications for sentencing credit.

The question of sentencing here is informed by the guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council for theft offences (November 2019 edition), which take account of the offence’s value, harm, culpability, and relevant aggravating or mitigating factors. The guideline emphasises the need to consider both the immediate financial loss and the wider consequences on victims’ sense of security and business viability.

As the Court of Appeal observed in R v. Grant [2020] EWCA Crim 1734, sentences for persistent shoplifting must reflect the cumulative impact on both victim businesses and the wider community's trust in lawful commerce. That case involved a defendant who specialised in the theft of high-value electronics over several months, raising similar issues of planning and repeat offending. The Court emphasised the deterrent effect of an immediate custodial sentence where prior warnings and interventions had failed.

In your case, I have been provided with a psychiatric report authored by Dr Simon Phillimore, consultant clinical psychologist, who conducted a detailed assessment at the request of the defence. The report is timely and comprehensive, encompassing interviews over three sessions and psychometric testing. Dr Phillimore’s opinion is that, while you do not suffer from a major mental health disorder, there are personality traits including impulsivity and low frustration tolerance that may have influenced offending behaviour. No formal diagnosis of impulse control disorder was made, and there was no evidence of psychosis or affective illness. Dr Phillimore recommends engagement with cognitive behavioural therapy to address such traits and improve adaptive coping mechanisms.

It is worth highlighting that the Pre-Sentence Report, prepared by probation officer Ms Caroline Dawes, offers a thoughtful synthesis of the personal, social, and risk factors present. Ms Dawes notes your history of sporadic employment and unstable housing but flags a pattern of non-engagement with previous support services, including local drug and alcohol counselling provisions. The report advises that any community disposal should be accompanied by robust supervision, opportunities for vocational training, and mechanisms for regular review and reassessment.

The probation department’s workload is, of course, considerable. Recent internal reviews have drawn attention to staffing shortages and the extended waiting times for interventions in the northwestern region. These systemic pressures inevitably affect delivery and compliance rates. While not an excuse, it contextualises the challenges faced in supporting individuals with complex needs.

With respect to the victim impact, detailed statements from several stores assert not only monetary loss but also increased anxiety among staff and heightened operational costs due to enhanced security measures. The accrual of these costs, when borne by small businesses, threatens viability. The court concurs with this view and recognises the disproportionate burden placed on such premises compared to large national chains.

It is further necessary to record that you have three prior convictions for shoplifting offences, spanning periods between 2018 and 2023. Two of these resulted in community orders, with compliance noted as partial and fluctuating. The third was resolved by a conditional discharge. This pattern causes the court concern, indicating that previous attempts at rehabilitation have met with limited success.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

I would remind all present that sentencing remains, fundamentally, a balancing exercise. The court must weigh factors of culpability, harm, personal mitigation, and public safety. The principle of proportionality, enshrined in both statute and common law, is paramount. Nonetheless, public and business confidence in the rule of law depends upon sentences which adequately deter and rehabilitate offenders.

The Law on sentencing also encompasses statutory provisions relating to ancillary orders. While the charges here do not attract the possibility of a restraining order or forfeiture under POCA legislation, the court is alert to any suggestion that restraining conditions may assist in preventing further offending. The probation service will consider this within their report.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

The court acknowledges that a plea of guilty at an early stage can materially benefit all parties. Cases such as R v. Dukes [2022] EWCA Crim 659 reinforce the reduction of sentence as an essential feature of encouraging timely admissions, yet reiterate that reductions must be contextually appropriate.

Turning to other matters tangential to the case but pertinent to the broader judicial milieu, I note the increasing prevalence of social media influence on court proceedings. Specifically, disturbing trends on platforms such as TikTok and Instagram have introduced a new dynamic whereby live or recorded courtroom content may circulate publicly, potentially impacting witness willingness and juror impartiality. While this case has not been affected, the court recognises the growing challenges posed by digital culture in safeguarding the justice process.

Finally, I would observe that this courtroom, recently refurbished at significant public expense, offers modern facilities designed both for enhanced security and accessibility. The audio-visual systems installed herein have already played an essential part in ensuring fair and efficient proceedings in similar cases, streamlining the presentation of evidence and minimizing disruption.

In conclusion, I will direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report by the probation service, requesting particular attention be paid to the suitability of community-based rehabilitative measures, including structured cognitive behavioural work, vocational assistance, and financial management support. The report should also address any appropriate protective conditions, as well as consider the prospects for compliance and risk reduction.

Sentencing will be adjourned to a date following receipt of the pre-sentence report, thereby enabling this court to frame an appropriate and proportionate disposal in the interests of justice and public safety. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be preserved and disseminated according to the mandates outlined within the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5.

This hearing has been conducted in open court with all parties and representatives present. I thank Ms Felicity Glover of the Crown Prosecution Service and Mr Lucas Chandler for the defence for their submissions and professional conduct. I also express gratitude to the court staff, ushers, and clerks who have ensured the smooth function of these proceedings despite recurrent pressures on court capacity nationally.

The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal against sentencing within twenty-eight days under relevant legislation, including the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply, nor have any been sought or granted.

These are the orders of the court.
