IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/04597  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. Fairweather  
Filed: 11 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for an offence under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to a series of alleged shoplifting incidents extending over a period exceeding eighteen months. The offending is characterised by multiple thefts from various retail establishments across the Brighton and Hove area. Your case has engaged the full rituals and protocols that attend modern Crown Court proceedings, including staged hearings, expert assessments, and extensive evidential disclosure.

Procedural and Investigative Background  
Your arrest occurred on 8 May 2025, following an investigation instigated by the Sussex Retail Crime Working Group, augmented by local police units and the Business Crime Reporting Team. The investigation was prompted by a rise in shop theft involving repeat incidents at multiple convenience stores and pharmacies predominantly along the central North Laine shopping district. The resulting case file was voluminous, comprising CCTV material, witness statements, digital exhibits, and forensic analysis of recovered merchandise and clothing items.

This court, while charged with adjudicating individual guilt and imposing appropriate sanction, acknowledges the complex and resource-heavy nature of investigations into such offences. The deployment of officers to support detailed inquiries, the time-investment of specialist analysts in piecing together footage, and the diligence required to maintain evidential chains are matters of record. The court further notes that such efforts, while focused on offending often of modest pecuniary value, represent a significant investment of public interest and funds.

You were first interviewed under caution on 12 May, at which time you denied involvement. However, subsequently recovered items matching those identified in store records, coupled with video analysis and forensic textile matching, led to your charge on 21 May. The charge was framed as a representative count encompassing multiple thefts attributable to a course of conduct rather than isolated incidents.

The case has been managed under the Crown Court Case Management reforms to ensure conforming timeliness and procedural fairness. Delays occasioned in your matter, as in many comparable proceedings, stemmed in large part from contested disclosure applications and the necessity to instruct a clinical expert to assess your mental health profile. Your legal team, instructed pursuant to a representation order, applied diligently for these commissions, though the court must note the repeated resubmissions required by the Legal Aid Agency before sanction was granted for expert instruction. Such bureaucratic hesitations are lamentable in their frequency and consequence.

In the recent sentencing hearing held today, all parties have been present and represented. I specifically note and thank Mr Jonathan Mercer, Counsel for the Crown, and Ms Zoe Hartley, instructed for your defence. Both have conducted themselves with professional decorum and made submissions of evident care and precision.

The court places on record that in addition to the formal legal team, officer input from the Sussex Probation Service, notably Ms Felicity James, and the contributions of Dr Alan McBride, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, have been invaluable in forming a rounded understanding of your circumstances. Their reports, submitted pursuant to court direction, provide essential but sometimes contradictory perspectives on risk and rehabilitative prospects.

However, this procedural background, while indispensable for justice, must not obscure the substantive realities before us. Petty theft, particularly in repetitious or systematic forms, is not a benign offence. It burdens businesses, unsettles staff, diverts law enforcement resources, and cumulatively contributes to an erosion of social trust.

The court is similarly aware of the current strains borne by local service providers—housing teams over capacity, mental health units with extended waiting lists, and voluntary organisations stretched thin. The ripples of one individual's conduct are felt far wider than the immediate theft of goods.

The legal framework governing theft is well established. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. Case law has refined the principles for sentencing, considering factors such as culpability, harm, and mitigating circumstances.

In particular, the guideline issued by the Sentencing Council in 2023 concerning theft offences provides a sentencing tariff tailored to the value of goods stolen, the sophistication and persistence of offending, and the impact on victims and community confidence.

Reference is also made to the principle enunciated in R v. Forbes [2020] EWCA Crim 1981, where the Court emphasised that persistent acquisitive criminality, though low in monetary value, carries a cumulative social harm warranting deterrent sentences.

The facts of the offending are, therefore, central to the court’s determination.

Turning now to the nature of your conduct, the prosecution relies heavily on CCTV footage depicting entry into multiple retail premises, the concealment of goods under clothing and within bags, and behaviour suggestive of deliberate evasion of point-of-sale payment.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

The court notes the persistence of the offending pattern, with several incidents occurring during early evening hours when staffing levels in shops were relatively reduced. This is relevant when considering both the premeditation and the likelihood of detection.

The sophistication demonstrated by use of layered clothing and misdirection calls into question any suggestion that these were impulsive lapses borne purely of momentary desperation.

This is consistent with observations received from various retail employees, some of whom attested to heightened anxiety and diminished sense of personal safety during your visits.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

There is also recorded evidence that, on occasion, attempts were made to remove security tags from goods, a more deliberate step beyond simple concealment.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

Among the impacted venues is a small independent pharmacy, staffed predominantly by part-time workers and volunteers. Their statements underscore a palpable fear that the pattern of thefts undermined not only financial viability but the spirit of community care that typifies their operation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

The court must balance the material and psychological impact endured by victims against your own circumstances.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Turning to ancillary matters, I acknowledge the letter submitted on your behalf by the Brighton Homeless Project, noting your recent unstable housing situation and adverse childhood experiences. These mitigate to some degree the gravity of your position but do not remove responsibility.

Similarly, correspondence from your sister highlighted ongoing familial support notwithstanding your difficulties, and the court welcomes such stabilising influences.

It is regrettable that prior opportunities for diversion and intervention, including a Community Resolution Order issued in late 2023, failed to deter further offending. This raises difficult questions about engagement and the capacity or willingness to embrace rehabilitative measures.

I also note with interest that this court received a report from the local Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangement (MAPPA) because of an unrelated matter involving a co-defendant, which did not, however, implicate you personally.

In the wider legal context, the court is mindful of the line of authority established in R v. Pascoe [2022] EWCA Crim 846, which emphasised that community-based disposals should be prioritised where feasible but recognised that persistent acquisitive offending may necessitate custodial sentences to uphold deterrence.

Equally, the recent decision in R v. Ellison [2024]
