IN THE CROWN COURT AT PLYMOUTH  
R v. MR H  
Case No. P2025/13049  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. HARRISON  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction on a representative charge relating to theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans a period from mid-2023 through to early 2025, with various thefts committed within the Plymouth area and its environs. This sentence hearing is the culmination of proceedings that have engaged multiple agencies and generated a substantial evidential record.

Procedural Background  
Your case came before the magistrates’ court originally on 29 March 2025, where you entered a not guilty plea. Following prosecution disclosure and the preparation of a detailed evidential bundle by the Crown, the case was committed to this court by way of summary trial under the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative. The BCM framework, introduced in 2015, is intended to improve efficiency in case progression through proactive case tracking, early procedural management, and timely allocation of appropriate resources. This case was allocated to the Plymouth Crown Court centre with listing initially set for 15 July 2025.

In the months that followed, the matter experienced a number of short adjournments, some arising from defence counsel’s application for Legal Aid funding to instruct a forensic psychological assessment, which was eventually authorised on 21 July. The prompt resolution of such applications remains a critical element in protecting defendants’ rights to a fair and expeditious trial, yet it remains a recurrent source of procedural frustration. Indeed, as recently seen in R v. Jalali [2025] EWCA Crim 324, the Court of Appeal lamented the systemic delays introduced by administrative rigidities within the Legal Aid framework, noting the consequent impact on both defendants and judicial timetabling.

On 5 September, you changed plea and entered a guilty plea upon the cusp of trial. The Crown accepts the plea but notes it was not at the earliest opportunity. This lapse engages the principles set out in R v. Forsyth [2022] EWCA Crim 151, which clarifies that credit for guilty pleas must reflect the timing, sincerity, and impact on case management.

Turning to the broader context of retail theft, this court is mindful that despite public perceptions, such offences cannot be treated lightly. As noted in R v. Stanton [2019] EWCA Crim 804, the Court observed that repeated thefts from vulnerable or small-scale retail traders have a chilling effect on both economic activity and community cohesion. The social and psychological dimensions extend beyond mere financial loss, influencing staff wellbeing and local commercial viability.

The Local Business Crime Reduction Partnership in Plymouth has also issued detailed briefings on trends in uneconomic acquisitive crime. These reports draw attention to a marked increase in opportunistic theft concurrent with the economic downturn post-2021, and reference the strain placed on policing and retail security resources. It is regrettably a feature of contemporary life that such offences impose cumulative costs that ripple through communities in ways that are difficult to quantify.

Mr H, the court acknowledges with thanks the contributions of Ms Ingrid Patel of the Plymouth Business Crime Unit, whose detailed evidence and liaison with affected retailers has been instrumental in securing a comprehensive prosecutorial case. Similarly, Detective Inspector Carmen Reeves of Devon and Cornwall Police is commended for overseeing a multi-faceted investigation involving covert surveillance, licensed PLG (public location gathering) operations, and digital media analysis.

In relation to the defendant’s background, detailed preparatory reports have been received. The pre-sentence report, prepared by Officer Melinda Clough of the Devon Probation Service, offers an extensive overview of your personal circumstances, prior convictions, and current social supports. Officer Clough’s narrative highlights the challenges faced by individuals living with socioeconomic instability in the South West region, particularly within post-industrial urban areas of Plymouth.

The probation report underscores the prevalence of housing insecurity and its contributory role in recidivistic offending, especially when intersected with untreated substance misuse and episodic employment. Consideration is also given to your reported history of childhood neglect and early school exclusion, gaps in which were partially addressed during a short educational placement at Dawlish Youth Centre.

Notably, a comprehensive psychiatric assessment was appended to the probation documents. Dr Fiona Hargrave, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at Derriford Hospital, provided this evaluation following a request from the defence. Dr Hargrave’s report, dated 28 August 2025, considers the presence of several neurodevelopmental traits and moderate depressive symptoms, but concludes that no enduring psychotic or bipolar disorder is evident. She specifically notes a propensity for impulsive behaviour in response to stressors and a diminished capacity for long-term planning.

Dr Hargrave emphasises that while your condition might inform some risk factors for reoffending, it does not in itself excuse criminal behaviour. The expert recommends a structured behavioural programme with an emphasis on anger management and cognitive-behavioural therapy, ideally integrated with social housing support services.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

It is important to note that such diagnostic observations are, by necessity, clinical opinions formed at a discrete point in time and do not constitute measures dispositive of culpability. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the Court of Appeal clarified that the presence of a mental health disorder should be factored into sentencing only insofar as it bears upon responsibility and risk to the public. The present case does not raise such issues to a degree demanding diversion or hospital order.

Returning to the procedural history, it is regrettable that this matter was affected by an unrelated disruption on 14 April 2025 to court listings following industrial action by court staff, as reported in local media outlets. This was one of several staffing challenges affecting Devon and Cornwall judiciary in recent years, with recruitment and retention difficulties placing persistent strain on dispensing justice within expected timelines.

Mr H, the court has also considered letters of support submitted on your behalf. These include correspondence from Ms Joy Bennett, your sister, who describes your attempts to desist from criminality and the difficulties in securing stable accommodation compounded by the ongoing housing shortage across the South West peninsula. Others include a carefully composed statement from the Plymouth Food Bank coordinator, Mr Lorenzo Edwards, who notes your intermittent engagement with food aid services but expresses cautious optimism for your compliance with community orders.

It is worth reflecting here on the broader operational challenges faced by voluntary sector organisations. Food banks and emergency homelessness services operate under perennial funding constraints and rising demand, particularly post-pandemic. Their contributions remain vital yet under-recognised within criminal justice processes.

In considering the impact upon victims, the court records with regret the statements supplied by the managers of the retail outlets concerned. These narratives attest not only to the direct financial losses incurred but also to heightened staff anxiety levels and increased security expenditure, including installation of electronic tagging systems and staff training initiatives. There is evidence that some outlets reduced staffing hours or altered shift patterns to accommodate security concerns, impacts which cascade through the local employment market.

It is pertinent to observe that greater Plymouth has seen a modest uptick in shoplifting offences over the past three years, with an observable concentration in economically marginalised areas. The complexities of such crime patterns challenge police resources already dedicated to a broad spectrum of serious offences, including drugs, burglary, and violent crime.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

The court is conscious that you have a history of offending, albeit non-violent, including previous convictions for similar offences, some dating back to your youth. Over the last decade, you have encountered multiple criminal justice interventions including community sentences and conditional discharges, yet recidivism remains persistent. This history raises serious concerns as to deterrence and potential rehabilitation.

One must be candid that repeat offending of this nature undermines public confidence and exacts cumulative costs not only on the individuals and businesses directly affected but on society’s collective resources devoted to crime prevention and correction. It is by no means a trivial matter that courts are increasingly called upon to address patterns of recidivism in acquisitive crime with firm but proportionate sanctions.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

This court is further obliged to note statutory sentencing guidance. The Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline (effective from November 2024) mandates assessment by culpability and harm categories, with emphasis on factors such as planning, repetition, use of deception, and impact on victims. Thoughtful application of these criteria is essential in balancing the objectives of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection.

It is also relevant to mention the framework for credit on guilty plea. As set down in the definitive ruling of R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, late pleas—those entered only after overwhelming evidence becomes insurmountable—may attract significantly reduced reductions. The guiding principle is to reward genuine responsibility taken at the earliest reasonable moment.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

I record my gratitude to counsel for their pointed and measured submissions today. Ms Emily Frost, appearing for the Crown, has highlighted the seriousness of offending and the necessity for sentencing that reflects both individual culpability and wider social deterrence. Mr Daniel Weir, for the defence, has urged consideration of your personal difficulties and the therapeutic recommendations outlined in Dr Hargrave’s report.

The court also acknowledges the calm and measured manner in which court officers and ushers have conducted today’s proceedings, ensuring order and respect throughout the arraignment. It is of note that this courtroom was recently refurbished to enhance accessibility and security, a welcome investment in the administration of justice that the court applauds.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

While this case concerns repeated dishonesty, the court’s attention is drawn to the broader public safety regime in which sentences are delivered. Multi-agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), proven effective in managing offenders posing serious risks, operate alongside less formal structures such as Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARAC). Though your offending does not presently engage these higher-tier protocols, the interface between policing, probation, and social services remains critical.

Of additional interest is the ongoing strain on mental health services within Devon and Cornwall. Waiting lists for cognitive-behavioural therapy programs extend to several months longer than recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). This capacity gap complicates timely access to interventions for offenders exhibiting traits identified in psychiatric evaluations.

It is a regrettable reality that social safety nets, strained by austerity measures and shifting policy priorities over the past decade, operate at or beyond capacity. Yet the court must maintain its focus on the individual accountability and legal standards central to sentencing.

In concluding, I underscore that this court is neither dispassionate nor indifferent to the circumstances that cluster around cases such as this. Poverty, mental health challenges, and lack of stable housing are factors of undeniable consequence and deserving of robust state response. But such realities do not excuse or minimise culpable criminal acts.

Following consideration of all materials before the court—including the probation report, psychiatric assessment, victim impact statements, and submissions by counsel—I reserve sentencing for a date to be fixed, pending the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report.

It is my intention that the report provide a comprehensive appraisal of risk, personal circumstances, and proposed rehabilitative pathways. In particular, I wish the probation service to explore the feasibility of community-based sanctions incorporating structured programmes addressing impulsivity, substance misuse, and financial management. The goal is to recommend interventions proportionate to both your offending and the protection of the public.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Plymouth. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. You are advised of your right to appeal within a period of 28 days in accordance with section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
