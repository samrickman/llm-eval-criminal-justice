IN THE CROWN COURT AT HACKNEY  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/11865  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. WATSON  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced in connection with an offence of theft, specifically shoplifting, carried out over an extended period and within multiple retail premises located throughout the Greater London area, in particular the boroughs of Hackney, Islington, and Tower Hamlets. The charge pressed under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 encapsulates a series of acts reflecting a course of conduct rather than a singular event. 

As is well understood, the Theft Act 1968 remains the cornerstone statute governing dishonest appropriation, and the subsequent jurisprudence continues to develop its application with particular regard to the context and circumstances of the offending. It is important to note that, while shoplifting may, at a glance, be perceived as a relatively minor infringement of the law, the cumulative effect of repeated thefts has far-reaching consequences, not only economically but also socially and psychologically for those employed in retail and the wider communities they serve.  

Since this court’s establishment in 1878, it has borne witness to the evolution of judicial approaches to acquisitive crime, frequently grappling with the tension between sympathy for individual circumstances and the overarching imperative of public protection. That the courts have, over recent decades, adopted sentencing frameworks responsive to the nuances of offending behaviour and offender vulnerability is testament to that enduring balance.  

It is pertinent to observe, as a matter of judicial reflection and broader social commentary, the continuing strain placed on local law enforcement by the prevalence of low-value property offences. These offences, which include shoplifting, while unlikely to feature prominently in headlines or political discourse, nevertheless consume substantial investigative resources. The extent and nature of these demands were set out cogently in the police report dated 18 February 2025, attached to the prosecution bundle. The report referenced the impact of complexities arising from overlapping jurisdictional responsibilities between borough command units and specialist retail crime squads.

Central to the effective administration of justice in cases such as these is the role played by local Business Crime Reduction Partnerships (BCRPs), which seek to minimise repeat offending through collaborative efforts involving police officers, retailers, local councils, and community groups. The Hackney BCRP, established in 2015 following Home Office funding, has deployed a variety of strategic interventions, including enhanced CCTV integration and intelligence-led policing tactics. Notwithstanding these initiatives, the inherent challenges of sustaining consistent multi-agency cooperation remain, magnified by staff turnover, fluctuating budget allocations, and competing operational priorities.  

It should be noted that the offence before the court was the subject of a protracted investigative process. The defendant was arrested on 2 April 2025 after an initiative led by the Crime Reduction Unit which capitalised on retail-sector reports detailing rising inventory discrepancies at various convenience stores. These reports reflected a pattern of illicit behaviour observed as early as late 2023, although isolated and not initially connected. The process involved evidential collation spanning digital security footage, witness statements, and forensic analysis of recovered property.  

This court is mindful of the technological dimensions increasingly integral to contemporary policing. For example, as reported by the Metropolitan Police Digital Forensics Unit, the volume of data processed per shoplifting investigation has grown exponentially. The case at hand required the review of over 15,000 frames of high-definition CCTV footage across multiple locations. Such workload contributes significantly to the backlog in analytical capacities, impeding swift progression of cases.  

Also worthy of attention is the recurrent issue of delay, often rooted in the procedural complexities of securing counsel instructed under the Legal Aid Agency. These delays, particularly in obtaining forensic and psychiatric expertise, have ripple effects, complicating timely access to justice — a principle enshrined in both domestic jurisprudence and the European Convention on Human Rights.  

In your case, Mr H, there was a regrettable extension of pre-trial proceedings due principally to several applications made by your defence team seeking authorisation to instruct an independent forensic psychologist. The initial application, submitted on 12 May 2025, was met with procedural queries by the Agency, culminating in definitive approval only on 5 July. This delay is illustrative of systemic challenges recently acknowledged in the Ministry of Justice’s 2024 Review of Legal Aid Provision, which highlighted “administrative inertia” and “excessive bureaucratic hurdles” as impediments to equitable defence preparation.  

The court appreciates the efforts of your appointed counsel, Mr Gareth Fairbrother, whose methodical approach and professional diligence, despite the constraints imposed by delayed funding authorisations, stand as a commendable example of advocacy within the current environment.

Parallel to the legal representation issues, this matter underscores the strain endured by probation services, whose capacity to conduct comprehensive background assessments and deliver supportive interventions is hindered by persistent understaffing and high case loads. Recent probation service bulletins, notably the Annual Performance Report 2024, confirm a national shortfall of approximately 20% in frontline officers, exacerbated in urban centres such as London.

The mental health dimension must not be overlooked. Though your own psychiatric evaluation refrains from diagnosing a formal disorder, the report from Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist Dr Ollie Mehta, dated 1 August 2025, highlights underlying features of impulsivity and borderline emotional dysregulation. Dr Mehta’s report, prepared after two clinical interviews and collateral information gathering, also notes your inconsistent engagement with voluntary support services and reluctance to maintain therapeutic contact.

Such findings resonate with observations from recent academic literature on the nexus between borderline personality traits and acquisitive offending (see, for example, McAllister & Queen, 2023, Journal of Forensic Psychology). Nevertheless, as emphasised in R v. Duffy [2019] EWCA Crim 1123, while psychiatric traits may inform sentencing considerations, they do not remove accountability where offending behaviour persists. In that case, the defendant’s borderline pathology was noted but ultimately deemed insufficient to preclude a custodial sentence in the context of repeat theft and deliberate evasion.  

Similarly instructive is R v. Claremont [2022] EWCA Crim 1158, wherein the court considered a defendant’s failure to adhere to prior community orders as indicative of limited rehabilitation prospects absent custodial supervision. Those authorities are germane here.

The court has also considered the victim statements compiled as part of the prosecution’s bundle. Store managers and employees from establishments including East End Grocers, Maxwell Chemists, and Hackney Convenience Supplies have contributed accounts describing not only economic loss but also heightened anxiety and operational disruption caused by your conduct. These statements gravitate beyond the immediate monetary value of stolen goods, highlighting the corrosive impact of repeat offending on staff wellbeing and workplace morale.

It bears noting that these lived experiences often carry heavy weight in the sentencing calculus, as elucidated in Sentencing Council guidelines on theft offences, which call upon courts to account for harm “beyond pure financial loss” including “psychological distress, disruption to staff, and reputational damage to businesses.”

Factually, Mr H, your offending involved multiple attempts to conceal and appropriate items
