IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTWELL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14568  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. Fenwick  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for a representative offence under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, concerning shoplifting offences. The offending in question spans a considerable temporal period, commencing in late 2023 and culminating in early 2025. The jurisdictions implicated are varied, encompassing retail outlets across the Hartwell, Eastbridge, and Southwell boroughs. You have entered a plea of guilty to the charge following a detailed investigation and evidential review.

Procedural History  
Your arrest occurred on 11 February 2025 after a thorough intelligence-led operation involving coordination between Hartwell Borough Police, the Retail Crime Reduction Unit, and local council enforcement officers. The operation relied extensively on analysis of CCTV data collected over many months, supplemented by witness statements and stock loss audits provided by affected retailers. The local Retail Crime Reduction Unit has, for some time, been reporting an escalation in repeat low-level thefts, notably within small independent shops, convenience stores, and chain pharmacies. While such offences may appear minor in monetary terms, their cumulative impact has been documented as significantly deleterious to community confidence and the viability of these businesses.

The pace and complexity of the investigation led to a summons, with initial hearings commencing on 2 March 2025. The case was managed under the Criminal Procedure Rules and Better Case Management protocols, with the aim of progressing proceedings expeditiously while ensuring preparatory compliance. Notwithstanding this, defence applications for disclosure and expert reports occasioned several adjournments. The Legal Aid Agency’s processing of applications for funding to instruct psychiatric and forensic experts was protracted, underscoring the oft-lamented difficulties practitioners face in securing timely approvals. The attendant delays are a source of ongoing systemic concern.

This court recognises, with due appreciation, the diligence of Ms Laura Finch, prosecuting counsel, and Mr John Maynard, representing the defence pursuant to legal aid grants. Their cooperation has facilitated orderly progress despite systemic hurdles. I acknowledge also the efforts of the court clerks and support staff who have managed the administrative burden of this matter.

Before turning to the facts of the offence and sentencing considerations, this court recalls the prevailing context in which such offending occurs. It is undeniable that we exist in a period marked by persistent challenges in housing stability, employment insecurity, and public service underfunding. The strain upon mental health provision is well-documented; waiting lists for psychological interventions grow, and community resources remain stretched thin. That said, the court’s remit is to assess culpability and risk based on evidence and established legal principles. While sympathetic to the broader socioeconomic milieu, this court must ensure that individual accountability and public protection remain paramount.

It may be useful to note, for the record, that issues of procedural fairness and complainant welfare continue to be paramount in acquisitive crime cases. The enduring difficulties faced by retail staff tasked with reporting offences while maintaining front-line service roles cannot be overstated. Victims, often employees with minimal training in crime reporting and victim support, bear considerable emotional and operational costs, including anxiety about reprisals and job security.

A review of relevant case law provides guidance on sentencing in theft-related offending. In R v. Dellingham [2022] EWCA Crim 1583, the Court of Appeal reiterated that the value of goods stolen, while relevant, should not overshadow the broader context — including the impact on the victim’s business operations, the defendant’s antecedents, and the offender’s attitude toward rehabilitation. Dellingham involved a defendant convicted of repeat offences across multiple premises, where cumulative harm was emphasised over isolated valuations. The Court held that deterrence and public protection warranted custodial sentences even when individual thefts were low in value.

Furthermore, in R v. Stanwood [2023] EWCA Crim 742, it was determined that the timing and sincerity of guilty pleas bear heavily on sentencing credit. The Court held that credit awarded for a plea very late in proceedings, especially when entered only after the Crown’s case had become incontrovertible, should be diminished accordingly. This principle has been invoked repeatedly in trials involving persistent acquisitive offending.

Additional reference is made to R v. Eastbury [2019] EWCA Crim 1245, a case concerning aggravated retail theft complicated by issues of mental health. There, while the Court acknowledged the defendant’s diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, it stressed that clinical need does not negate sentencing obligations, although it may inform sentencing structure and rehabilitative interventions.

It is important to note that this court is acutely familiar with the increasing administrative and operational pressures borne by probation services nationally. Staffing shortages and escalating caseloads, compounded by the expansion of statutory duties, have created deficits in case management capacity. This is often made manifest in delayed production of pre-sentence reports or incomplete risk assessments. Nonetheless, probation officers continue to endeavour to provide high quality reports guiding judicial decision-making.

Similarly, mental health services face unprecedented demands. The National Health Service’s community psychiatric teams are often overwhelmed, leading to protracted delays in assessments and limited availability of specialised forensic psychiatric input. This is regrettable but does not absolve defendants from accountability.

In relation to victim impact, it is acknowledged that the Retail Support Network, a voluntary sector organisation dedicated to assisting affected businesses, has provided detailed representations in this case. Their reports underline the psychological impact of persistent thefts on retail staff, highlighting effects such as increased stress, diminished workplace morale, absenteeism, and, in some cases, early resignation. They also lament the limited statutory powers available to enforce community orderings targeted at repeat offenders, noting legislative gaps which may undermine effective diversion pathways.

Before considering the substantive allegations, it is necessary to address the phenomenon of co-defendants and unrelated parties occasionally referenced in correspondence. In one recent case before this court, involving R v. Miller and others [2024], a co-defendant was implicated in offences including possession of an offensive weapon and assault on a police officer. Those matters, while serious, bear no relevance to the present defendant’s conduct and do not factor into today’s sentencing considerations. It is a salutary reminder of the importance of precise case delineation.

A further observation can be made regarding the inclusion of historical offences from earlier decades in the defendant’s record abstracts. For example, a reference was made in submissions to an incident of fly-tipping on green belt land dating from 2008. That offence, while constituting an environmental crime, is too remote to hold any significant sentencing weight here.

It is also remarked that the defendant’s estranged sibling is currently subject to criminal investigation for alleged benefit fraud. That unrelated matter is inconsequential to this court.

The case was listed for initial plea and case management hearing on 30 March 2025, but was adjourned twice owing primarily to delays in instructing a forensic psychiatric expert. The delays were in part attributable to delays within the Legal Aid Agency, whose approval processes remain inconsistent and opaque, as described earlier.

The court is conscious of mounting judicial frustration with the cumulative effect of such bureaucratic impasses. It is essential that all parts of the criminal justice system cohere in a manner that promotes timely justice, yet respects necessary procedural rigour and safeguards. This case exemplifies the ongoing tension between administrative capacity and case progression demands.

On the substantive front, the Crown alleges a course of conduct constituting multiple occasions of theft. The facts of the case are as follows:

As noted in the investigative reports, the thefts were frequently characterised by the use of stolen shopping bags to conceal goods, often during busy periods. Mobile phone usage was sometimes employed as a distraction technique.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

The effect on shop employees was tangible, with statements evidencing increased anxiety and a sense of vulnerability. Several witnesses described changing their travel routes to avoid perceived repeat confrontations.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

At times, the defendant exhibited brazen disregard for store policies, including acts such as disabling security tags and making multiple visits within a short span.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Employee turnover in some of the impacted premises increased, with particular mention made of a pharmacy clerk who left due to stress attributed in part to contact with the defendant.

It is both instructive and sobering to note how non-violent acquisitive offending may nevertheless contribute to destabilising the workplace environment and jeopardising the psychological welfare of staff.

Despite warnings and community resolutions in 2023, the defendant resumed similar offending patterns.

Medical and Psychological Assessments  
A comprehensive psychiatric report was completed by Dr Fiona Lang, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, following instruction in May 2025. The report offers an insightful analysis of your mental state, concluding that you do not suffer from a major mental illness but display traits aligned with borderline intellectual functioning, co-morbid substance misuse (principally alcohol), and emotional dysregulation. The report notes impulsivity and difficulties with decision-making under stress, but attests to your capacity to understand proceedings and to exercise some control over behaviours when motivated.

Dr Lang emphasises that while psychiatric intervention may be beneficial in long-term rehabilitation, the current psychiatric profile does not negate criminal responsibility.

A probation pre-sentence report was duly commissioned and submitted in mid-August 2025. Probation Officer Ms Claire Henderson comments on your lack of sustained engagement with support services, your precarious housing situation, and sporadic employment efforts. Ms Henderson highlights the absence of any meaningful pro-social supports in your life and underscores a moderate risk of reoffending absent targeted intervention.

The report recommends a community order with an accredited cognitive skills programme, coupled with engagement in local substance misuse services. The potential for bail accommodation adjustments and supported housing placements is also highlighted.

It has been brought to this court’s attention, albeit somewhat tangentially, that a recent noise abatement notice was issued to the landlord of a property rented by a distant relative of yours. While this is peripheral, it exemplifies the challenges of maintaining stable tenancy arrangements in high-demand urban areas.

I must also mention that at an earlier hearing at the adjacent magistrates’ court, a co-defendant who had faced charges of harassment and possession of an offensive weapon failed to appear and remains at large. This matter is entirely separate from your case.

Sentencing Principles and Considerations  
Turning to sentencing, the primary statutory framework is articulated in the Sentencing Act 2020 and the Theft Act 1968. The overarching aims—punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection—guide this court’s approach.

The Sentencing Council guidelines on theft offences speak to factors such as frequency, planning, value, and the impact on the victim or community. While the value in cases of shoplifting may be low individually, a course of conduct spanning multiple offences with cumulative harm elevates seriousness.

Your persistence despite prior community resolutions, cautions, and warnings weighs heavily as aggravation.

The late nature of your guilty plea reduces credit. The court is obliged, pursuant to authorities including R v. Stanwood and R v. Blackmore, to carefully calibrate the degree of allowance afforded for such admissions.

Whilst your personal circumstances, including housing instability and substance misuse, are relevant mitigation, they do not excuse repeated offending. Nor should they be allowed to diminish the legitimate expectations of businesses and their staff for safety and respect.

The court must also consider the necessity to send a clear message to those who view shoplifting as a low-risk, low-impact crime that can be conducted with impunity. Such attitudes undermine social cohesion and the rule of law.

Acknowledgements  
I record my thanks to the Hartwell Retail Business Association for facilitating victim impact statements and for their continued advocacy on behalf of affected retailers.

Similarly, I commend the steadfast work of the Hartwell Probation Service, whose representatives have admirably managed an increasing workload made more challenging by staffing shortfalls and funding cuts. Their recommendations are carefully considered in this court’s deliberations.

I reiterate the court’s regret at the protracted delays caused by Legal Aid administrative processes, which impede timely justice and strain practitioner resources.

Conclusion and Orders  
Having considered all written and oral material, including the psychiatric and probation reports, the representations made by counsel, and your own statements, I am not yet in a position to pass sentence today.

A full pre-sentence report will be obtained to inform the court’s ultimate decision. That report is to consider the appropriateness of custodial versus community-based disposals, the suitability of credit for a guilty plea in light of timing, and any available rehabilitative pathways.

The matter is accordingly adjourned to 20 November 2025, when sentence will be passed in this courtroom before me.

These sentencing remarks are made this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Hartwell. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Reporting restrictions, if any, are noted and adhered to.

No order as to costs is made at this time.

These are the orders of the court.
