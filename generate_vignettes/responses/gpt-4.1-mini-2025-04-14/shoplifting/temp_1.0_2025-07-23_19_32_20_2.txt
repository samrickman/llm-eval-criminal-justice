IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/15823  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. P. HENDERSON  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court charged with a representative count of theft, specifically a pattern of shoplifting offences, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences date from late 2023 through to the spring of this year and were concentrated primarily within various retail outlets throughout Greater Manchester. 

Procedural History  
Your case has traversed several procedural stages before arriving at this sentencing hearing. Initially recorded at the Magistrates’ Court on 2 June 2025, the matter was committed for trial under the Better Case Management (BCM) provisions pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules. Ms Jennifer Collins of the Crown Prosecution Service has conducted the prosecution, while Mr David Morrissey has been instructed on your behalf under the current Legal Aid scheme. The plea and trial preparation hearing, originally set for 24 August, was adjourned to 12 September due to delays in obtaining a suitable psychiatric report, a request supported by both prosecution and defence teams.

The BCM protocol aims to expedite cases by ensuring early identification of issues and to avoid protracted procedural delays. Notwithstanding institutional encouragement, it is noted that delays are all too frequently occasioned by administrative constraints, including funding applications relating to expert reports, an issue which has, regrettably, recurred in this case. Such delays place strain not only on the court’s listing resources but also on the parties involved, as well as on victims awaiting resolution.

It is germane to remind the court and parties that under the Criminal Procedure Rules, the disclosure obligations now extend to a duty on all actors to ensure timely and comprehensive provision of evidence. The present case, while moving ultimately within the expected timeframe, was not without its procedural tensions, likely reflective of the heavy operational load borne by the Crown Prosecution Service and the Legal Aid Agency alike.

The matter was before the court today following your entry of a guilty plea at the first available hearing post-adjournment. This plea was entered on the basis of a substantial evidential package assembled through diligent investigative efforts by Greater Manchester Police and cooperating retail security staff.

The persistent backdrop against which offences such as these arise cannot be ignored. We find ourselves in a society grappling with escalating levels of street-level acquisitive crime—sometimes described in the literature as an indicator of broader socioeconomic instability and fractured social contracts. While acknowledging these wider societal dynamics, the court’s focus remains necessarily fixed on the individual responsibility of offenders and the interests of community safety.

In R v. Greenwell [2019] EWCA Crim 1122, the Court of Appeal reiterated that persistent shoplifting calls for a sentencing approach that balances the offender’s culpability and mitigating circumstances against the broader social implications of unaddressed acquisitive offending. Greenwell is a useful comparator in underlining that while the value of stolen goods may seem modest, the repeat nature of offences and impact on staff anxiety and business viability are significant factors in sentencing.

Turning to more administrative matters, it is noteworthy that this court was among those recently refurbished in early 2025 under Ministry of Justice capital grants, improving access and facilities for witnesses and attendees alike. The refurbishment included improved technology suites facilitating enhanced video link evidence—a development welcomed by legal practitioners, given the challenges that local courts faced during the pandemic years and beyond.

It is well recorded that the Crown Prosecution Service faces ongoing resourcing pressures, as does Greater Manchester Police, which has seen an increasing proportion of officers reallocated to neighborhood engagement roles to better address the surge in non-serious crime. These strategic decisions reflect an attempt to maintain frontline presence in communities while also managing constrained budgets.

I note that the Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP) operating within Manchester has sought to adopt a multi-agency strategy model to address repeat shoplifting, though such efforts are frequently undermined by inconsistent data sharing and resource challenges. The Partnership's recent semi-annual report, submitted to the court, remarks on difficulties in standardising offender profiles and timely intelligence dissemination, highlighting a gap between policy objectives and practical implementation. 

Various voluntary sector agencies, notably the Manchester Retailers’ Support Service, have provided commendatory statements attesting to the negative impact on both staff morale and the economic sustainability of small businesses, especially independent grocers and pharmacies.

Incidentally, in case no one has noted, the Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Billingham [2020] EWCA Crim 2106, addresses sentencing considerations in low-level fly-tipping offences — an area of environmental enforcement that, while remote from this case, provides an illustrative contrast in judicial attitudes toward rural versus urban regulatory breaches and public harm vis-à-vis acquisitive crime. Such case law frequently surfaces in sentencing literature and training but rarely has practical bearing outside its specific fact scenarios.

On the note of environmental matters, Greater Manchester’s waste disposal services have also been subject to elevated scrutiny following an increase in illegal dumping, complicating the already significant burdens shouldered by local authorities contending with shrinking budgets and rising public expectation.

Historically, the Theft Act 1968 has undergone various amendments to clarify elements of dishonest appropriation and to better reflect evolving market conditions. Early provisions now superseded, such as those reviewed in R v. Fielding [1987] QB 540, have given way to streamlined applications of the law founded on the principles enunciated in R v. Ghosh [1982] EWCA Crim 2 and, more recently, Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67, refining the test for dishonesty.

The Crown’s filings highlight that your offending involved calculated concealment of merchandise in multiple shop visits, a modus operandi consistent with behaviour examined in R v. Maldonado [2016] EWCA Crim 1029, which emphasised custodial sentences as appropriate where offences are persistent and such conduct undermines retail sector confidence.

Of interest, the National Health Service’s capacity to provide timely mental health interventions, particularly for individuals involved in the criminal justice system, remains critically stretched. Reports indicate waiting times of up to 14 months for psychological assessment and support in the Greater Manchester area, contributing to challenges in the effective rehabilitation of offenders presenting with underlying vulnerabilities.

In your case, the court has had the benefit of a psychiatric report from Dr Celia Fenwick, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose assessment found no major mental illness but did note traits suggestive of impulsivity and low frustration tolerance. It is noteworthy, and regrettable, that your engagement with offered support services appears minimal.

That there remains a gap between availability and uptake of services is a matter of frequent professional lament, particularly in relation to community-based social support structures offered by charities and local authorities.

The court acknowledges a letter submitted by Shelter Manchester, expressing concerns regarding local housing insecurity, which has been implicated in repeat low-level offending by some residents under sustained stress. Shelter’s submission emphasised a “housing crisis” and called attention to the increasing reliance on temporary accommodation with inadequate support frameworks.

Furthermore, staff at Horizon Debt Advice charity provided a report indicating a significant rise in ‘financial distress referrals’ linked to increasingly punitive welfare reforms and local economic downturn.

It is incumbent to recognise the strain under which probation services operate. The Greater Manchester Probation Trust, in common with many agencies, reports significant caseload growth coupled with shortages of qualified officers—a dual challenge impacting the speed and quality of supervision and intervention planning, particularly for those subject to community orders.

Recent internal correspondence from Deputy Chief Probation Officer Jonathon Reece highlighted a backlog in pre-sentence report preparation, with estimated delays extending beyond six weeks in some instances, leading to adjournments and pressure on court timetabling. The court hopes that the present matter avoids such delay.

I turn to several victim impact statements tendered on behalf of retail employees affected by your conduct. These attest to elevated stress levels, increased absenteeism, and an atmosphere of fear induced by your repeated presence within their workplaces. While you did not employ threats or violence, the psychological effect on staff was considerable and tangible.

The Crown highlighted that despite previous warnings and diversionary efforts—including community resolutions and attendance at restorative justice meetings—you resumed the pattern of offending within months. This presents a clear challenge to the effectiveness of current intervention strategies.

In considering the principles set forth in the Sentencing Act 2020 and relevant guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Council, the court must balance the aims of punishment, rehabilitation, and public protection. The guideline for theft recommends credit for a guilty plea entered at the first reasonable opportunity, tempered by the sincerity of the plea and the extent of pre-trial preparation undertaken.

Cases such as R v. Sutherland [2023] EWCA Crim 840 affirmed that late pleas, entered only when conviction becomes inevitable, attract significantly reduced discounts. Equally, R v. Ellis [2021] EWCA Crim 429 reiterated that the persistence of offending after earlier warnings constitutes an aggravating factor.

Legal Aid coverage in this case has been notably problematic, with the defence application to engage independent psychiatric expertise subjected to protracted administrative delays lasting over five weeks. This mirrors systemic issues recently reported in the House of Commons Justice Committee’s inquiry into Legal Aid funding and process efficiency. The committee has recommended significant reform to prevent such bottlenecks, emphasising timely expert involvement as crucial for fairness.

The court notes with some disappointment that there is no evidence of positive engagement with community initiatives, employment schemes, or financial management courses. Despite overtures made by Probation and local outreach services, these opportunities remain unutilised.

It has become a regrettable pattern in shoplifting prosecutions that the repeat nature of offending coexists with a lack of sustained rehabilitation effort. While poverty and social disadvantage may be presented in mitigation, the court is mindful that such factors do not excuse or justify repeated breaches of the law.

The evidence before the court suggests that your offences, while not per se violent or involving significant property damage, nonetheless represent a calculated persistence which erodes trust and imposes real hardship on victims and small business operators.

The Crown asks the court to consider an immediate custodial sentence reflective of the aggravating features outlined, including persistence, breach of previous diversion, and the demonstrable impact on retail staff.

The defence, represented by Mr Morrissey, urges for a community order incorporating rehabilitative elements, including cognitive behavioural therapy and financial management support, emphasising your personal circumstances and an expressed willingness to desist.

The court must weight these submissions carefully. Sentencing in cases of persistent shoplifting ought not to be purely punitive but must also clearly signal that repeated breaches carry consequences, whilst providing structured support for desistance where realistic.

In order to inform that decision appropriately, I will direct the preparation of an up-to-date pre-sentence report from the local probation services. The report should consider any relevant interventions—both statutory and voluntary—and assess the feasibility of a community-based sentence with requirements designed to address offending behaviour and underlying social factors.

Today’s hearing has been conducted openly in Court 5 at Manchester Crown Court. I thank Ms Collins, counsel for the Crown, and Mr Morrissey, your legal representative. I also acknowledge the work of court staff—ushers, clerks, and administration—who, despite ongoing pressures, have maintained the decorum and order necessary for the administration of justice. The hearing room’s audio-visual systems, recently upgraded as part of broader Crown Court improvements, functioned without issue.

These sentencing remarks are issued this 14th day of October 2025 in Court 5 at Manchester Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the relevant authorities as required. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days under the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No special reporting restrictions apply in this matter. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
