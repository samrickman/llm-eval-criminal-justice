IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIxton  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/03452  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. Fenwick  
Filed: 17 September 2026

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentencing following your conviction for theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The matters now before me pertain to a series of incidents occurring over an extended period between September 2024 and April 2026 in multiple retail premises across Brixton and surrounding boroughs.

Procedural History  
Your case was first referred to this Crown Court subsequently to an allocation hearing held on 15 May 2026 before District Judge Reilly, who approved the sending of the case for sentence following your conviction in this court on 1 September 2026. The procedural trajectory has been marked by a series of applications, responses, and adumbrated delays, which regrettably have extended the time frame for final resolution. These included an adjournment necessitated to pursue further psychiatric assessment at your solicitors’ behest and prolonged liaison with Legal Aid authorities regarding funding approvals for expert reports.

On 22 June 2026, a plea and trial preparation hearing took place in this court where initial not guilty pleas were entered. However, as the prosecution evidence became incontrovertible, you subsequently entered a late guilty plea on 29 August 2026, less than a week before the trial was due to commence. It is a well-known pattern within these proceedings that late pleas, while providing some degree of mitigation, tend to attract less credit than earlier admissions made at the initial hearing stage pursuant to the Guidelines on Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea issued by the Sentencing Council (July 2023).

I wish to register my thanks to Ms Amanda Delaney appearing for the Crown and Mr Peter Crawley for the defence. Both counsel have conducted themselves with the requisite professionalism throughout this matter. It is perhaps unfortunate that the Legal Aid Agency’s deliberations introduced several avoidable procedural impediments. Notably, the approval for independent psychological evaluation was granted only after repeated correspondence and a protracted twenty-one-day delay. These bureaucratic hurdles are not simply administrative frustrations; they invariably impact on preparation, court listing, and ultimately the administration of justice.

The history of collaborative efforts between the Metropolitan Police Service and the local Business Crime Reduction Scheme for Brixton has featured prominently in the investigative development of this case. The Brixton Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BBCRP) continues to receive commendation for its tireless gathering and cross-referencing of shoplifting data, CCTV footage, and victim impact statements, which have been pivotal in forming a cohesive evidentiary matrix upon which the prosecution case rests.

This case sits uncomfortably within a wider societal context where low-level acquisitive offences increasingly burden already stretched front-line services. The constabulary’s own resources, committed across a spectrum of competing priorities including knife crime, domestic abuse, and serious organised crime activity, are finite. Every hour expended pursuing offences whose monetary value might be modest is time diverted from more pressing threats to public safety.

Accordingly, when offences of persistent shoplifting arise involving repeated breach of society’s norms of propriety and civic duty, the court’s response must balance the aims of punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation. The sentencing framework set out in the Theft Act 1968 and amplified through the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline for theft offences is the lodestar for these considerations.

In this vein, I take judicial notice of jurisprudential developments addressing contemporaneous hardship and culpability. In R v Seaton [2025] EWCA Crim 1893, the Court of Appeal recognized that while socio-economic deprivation may inform mitigation, it cannot wholly displace responsibility. The defendant therein claimed financial desperation, yet the court reaffirmed that repeated exploitation of vulnerabilities in retail settings, particularly where employees experience distress, justifies custodial penalty where appropriate. That decision overturns previous leniencies occasionally afforded on the basis of financial hardship alone.

I am also mindful of the important and evolving concept of the public interest in prosecuting and sentencing shoplifting offences. It is not merely loss of goods that is relevant but the cumulative impact on retailers, staff wellbeing, and community confidence that justifies robust judicial response. The court remains mindful of the often invisible harms wrought by such conduct.

Cases such as R v Greenfield [2024] EWCA Crim 544, albeit factually distinct, provide instructive precedents concerning the methodical misuse of self-checkout technology to effect theft. The offender in Greenfield employed sophisticated tactics involving fraudulent barcodes on high-value consumables, resulting in an immediate custodial sentence of 14 months, upheld on appeal. While the present defendant’s conduct does not engage such technological complexity, the principle that familiarity with retail environments and repeated offending exacerbates culpability remains germane.

Furthermore, the court notes the continuing relevance of R v Choudhury [2023] EWCA Crim 1101, where early engagement with rehabilitative schemes and candour before the court were held to be factors mitigating sentence—absent in the current proceedings where your plea was entered only after a well-prepared and unassailable prosecution case.

The facts of the offending are as follows:

In several instances, the court notes with concern the deployment of distraction techniques consistent with planned and repeated offending. Staff evidence conveyed significant distress, anxiety, and a sense of threat to personal safety, notwithstanding the absence of direct violence. This psychological impact is a material consideration, as acknowledged in R v Potter [2019] EWCA Crim 1532.

An elaborate pattern emerges from the available evidence, reflecting careful timing notably coinciding with shift changes and peak hours where supervision was comparatively diminished.

The defendant’s use of stolen or manipulated loyalty cards to procure merchandise free of charge or at reduced prices has concurrently posed long-term logistical challenges for the affected businesses. These operational disruptions have necessitated enhanced staff training and additional security expenditure, all detracting from service provision in those communities.

Added to this, staff have reported altered scheduling and a palpable decline in workplace morale directly attributable to repeated exposure to fear and intimidation related to thefts.

Prior to the present case, you were the subject of a community resolution for shop theft dated November 2023. Despite this intervention, and the partial curtailment it represented, the charges before this court reflect persistent disregard for concordant warnings and opportunities afforded for cessation.

Expert Reports and Risk Assessment  
I have received and carefully considered the detailed psychiatric report prepared by Dr Fiona Sterling, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, dated 5 September 2026. Dr Sterling’s evaluation, grounded in a series of clinical interviews and collateral material, acknowledges the absence of formal psychotic or mood disorder but highlights substantial impulsivity traits, coupled with moderate depressive symptoms exacerbated by housing instability. The report emphasises your limited engagement with local support services and a pattern of sporadic abstinence from substance misuse
