IN THE CROWN COURT AT MIDLANDS CENTRAL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. MC/2025/13456  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. G. Laxton  
Filed: 11 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your admission to offences of theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, pertaining specifically to multiple incidents of shoplifting. The offending behaviour took place over a protracted period spanning from the summer of 2023 through to April 2025, principally within the urban retail districts of Midlands Central borough and its outer suburbs. This case occupies the higher tier of the criminal justice system, reflecting both the seriousness and persistence of the offending pattern, notwithstanding the relatively low individual values of property taken.

Procedural History  
Your initial arrest occurred on 6 May 2025, following an investigative operation coordinated by the Midlands Metropolitan Police Retail Crime Unit, working in conjunction with the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership and the Midlands Central Safer Communities Board. The investigative process was characterised by painstaking collation of evidence which included the meticulous analysis of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage from multiple retail premises, victim statements, and the corroborative output of forensics teams working on seized property items found in your possession during your arrest. 

It should be noted that investigative operations of this nature require the dedicated commitment of frontline police officers, forensic specialists, and liaison officers acting in sometimes less-than-optimal working conditions. Particularly since 2020, police resources have been increasingly stretched due to competing demands such as serious and violent crime investigations, cybercrime innovations, and community policing obligations. Despite this, priority has rightly been given to the disruption and deterrence of serial acquisitive offending, for the cumulative impact of such behaviour on local businesses, staff welfare, and community confidence can be profound.

The original charging decision was made on 15 May 2025, resulting in allegations represented in a consolidated indictment before this court. The case was allocated under the auspices of the Better Case Management (BCM) initiative implemented nationally across Crown Courts to expedite the handling of cases while ensuring necessity and proportionality. The pre-trial process included a plea and trial preparation hearing on 20 June 2025, during which you entered an initial not guilty plea. That plea was maintained until the morning of the scheduled trial on 1 September 2025, at which point you submitted a full guilty plea. 

Such delays and late entries of plea are a regrettably common feature in cases of this nature, and this court must regard the timing of the plea as a significant sentencing factor. The principle, established decisively in the Court of Appeal rulings such as R v. Wainwright [2019] EWCA Crim 194 and reiterated in R v. Henley [2022] EWCA Crim 705, is that credit for a guilty plea is directly correlated with its timing and the extent to which it produces a saving of court time, witness distress, and resources. Late pleas are, therefore, entitled to diminished discount, reflective of their limited procedural benefit. These principles remain central to the court’s sentencing calculus.

The case has, regrettably, experienced procedural complications not wholly within the parties' control. Initial Legal Aid applications to fund the instruction of an independent forensic psychologist were delayed and required repeated submissions, extending the pre-sentence timetable by over six weeks. Such administrative friction is not unusual, yet it is regrettable, particularly given the importance of psychiatric input in assessing risk and rehabilitation prospects here. The court notes correspondence from defence counsel submitted on 25 July 2025 expressing frustration with such delays, underscoring the ongoing systemic challenges faced by practitioners navigating the Legal Aid Agency’s current funding protocols. It would be remiss not to register this ongoing concern, as procedural delays inevitably prejudice not only defendants but also victims awaiting resolution.

In assessing the impact of your offending on the affected parties, I have given careful consideration to written victim personal statements from several store managers and security staff. Their testimonies include frequent references to heightened stress, disruption of routine working patterns, and the economic consequences of increased security measures and stock losses. For example, one store manager operating in the Midlands Central Shopping Precinct reported that staff rotas were revised and shifts reduced in response to anxiety associated with repeated shoplifting incidents, including those linked to your conduct. This is consistent with national research, including that summarised in the Home Office report “Retail Crime: Impact and Mitigation” (2024), which highlights the compounded psychological strain on retail staff subjected to recurrent theft.    

Further to these observations, the court has had access to reports from the Midlands Retailers’ Support Network, a voluntary sector body working with independent proprietors to mitigate the consequences of shoplifting. Their submissions commendably balance recognition of the socio-economic factors frequently underpinning acquisitive wrongdoing with an unambiguous affirmation of support for victims and their staff. They raise important themes concerning the chronic underfunding of small business crime prevention schemes and the attendant risk of business closures or reduced local employment opportunities. These wider considerations, while not determining factors in the sentencing decision, provide a valuable contextual framework.

In accordance with usual practice, I have invited the probation service to prepare a comprehensive pre-sentence report, which includes a full assessment of risk, personal circumstances, and suitability for rehabilitative interventions. The Probation Officer, Ms. Jennifer Stowe, undertook an extensive interview with you on 3 September 2025 and supplemented this with collateral enquiries including engagement with social housing, local support agencies, and previous supervising officers. Her report is dated 8 September 2025 and is on file. I will engage with its findings later in these remarks.  

The court also received the forensic psychiatric report prepared by Dr. Louise Kwan, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at Midlands Central University Hospital, completed on 15 August 2025. The report is detailed, professionally drafted, and provides invaluable insight into your mental state and any psychological drivers relevant to offending behaviour. I outline key findings below after setting out the factual background.

The Legal Framework  
While the principal offence here is theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, it is important to situate this within the sentencing framework established by the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline for Theft Offences, published in September 2019 and effective since January 2020. That guideline emphasises the need to consider the seriousness of the offence in the round, including the value of stolen property, sophistication and planning, harm sustained by victims, previous convictions, and whether the offending is part of a persistent pattern.  

I also consider the case of R v. Venkatagiri [2019] EWCA Crim 456, which clarifies that sentencing for acquisitive crime must account for the wider impact on victims, community trust, and business viability, beyond mere monetary valuation. Venkatagiri reinforced that breach of trust within retail spaces and the consequential trauma to staff are legitimate aggravating features. Similarly, the judgment in R v. Mills [2021] EWCA Crim 1231 addressed repeat offending involving coordinated distraction tactics, underscoring the relevance of the offender’s modus operandi in aggravation.

I take judicial notice of the fact that your previous record is not extensive but contains several prior theft-related convictions spanning from 2018 to 2023, primarily low-level shoplifting and an instance of criminal damage to a shop window during a related protest. While the latter is not before this court, it does inform the overall narrative of risk and attitude to offending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

The facts of the offending, as established through unchallenged exhibits and your guilty plea, demonstrate a pattern of repeated entry into retail premises – often convenience stores, small supermarkets, and community pharmacies – with the intention to removing items without payment. This conduct was deliberate and methodical, evincing awareness and an ongoing desire to obtain goods illicitly. In several instances, your actions involved the use of concealment devices such as oversized jackets or bags, and, on at least two occasions, you were observed employing distraction techniques toward staff to facilitate theft.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

A salient feature of this offending is the temporal spread and methodical repetition. The court notes that many of the premises targeted were in areas of socioeconomic deprivation, and that much of the stolen property comprised everyday consumables, health and beauty aids, and foodstuffs. While the individual value of items is modest, the cumulative detriment is not insignificant. The continual return visits placed store managers on heightened alert, and the victims’ statements convey a sense of frustration and vulnerability.

Between 22 March 2024 and 16 January 2025, your conduct escalated in both frequency and boldness, with multiple incidents documented within individual calendar weeks. Security footage analysed reveals a growing confidence in the acts, including occasions when you paid cursory attention to the presence of staff or other customers.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

Even as some of your prior offending was dealt with via community resolution or conditional discharge, this did not deter repetition. Such recidivism, while sadly (though not universally) familiar in acquisitive crime, crystallises the challenge for sentencing authorities in calibrating a response that upholds both deterrence and rehabilitation.

The court further notes that your arrest in May 2025 followed concerted intelligence-led policing, including joint surveillance operations and analysis of transaction data. The use of advanced investigative techniques here speaks to the resource-intensive nature of such cases, the diversion of valuable manpower, and consequent impacts on broader policing priorities. The public interest demands that these investments yield justice and prevention.

Expert Reports and Assessments  
The psychiatric report from Dr. Kwan offers a nuanced picture. While there was no evidence of severe mental illness or psychosis, she identified traits consistent with mild impulse control difficulties and chronic anxiety, which may be intertwined with background social and financial stressors. Substance misuse was noted as episodic rather than entrenched, and there was no indication of personality disorder, although mood fluctuations were apparent. Dr. Kwan emphasised that your engagement with therapeutic services had been minimal, citing missed appointments and lack of sustained compliance.  

Her conclusion explicitly states that any mitigating effect these factors might have is limited by the absence of active participation in support programmes. More broadly, she makes recommendations for structured intervention centred on cognitive behavioural therapy targeting impulsivity and coping mechanisms, alongside social support for housing and employment.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

The pre-sentence report echoes the clinical findings, drawing attention to your current unstable housing situation, limited employment history, and minimal engagement with voluntary-sector support organisations. The report highlights persistent patterns of self-neglect that may undermine rehabilitation efforts, while also acknowledging some degree of expressed remorse, albeit mitigated by shifting accounts during assessment.

Ms Stowe expresses concern about the adequacy of existing informal support networks, particularly given the discontinuation of a local diversion initiative earlier this year due to funding cuts. She recommends exploration of community-based Sentence Rehabilitation Requirements with an emphasis on financial literacy, impulse control group work, and possibly unpaid work as a restorative element.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

It is of note that you have, on occasion, asserted that your offending was motivated by financial desperation, including periods of unemployment and benefit sanctions. While such context is relevant, the court is bound to maintain that hardship does not equate to an unfettered licence to engage in criminality. The law must balance compassion with the protection of society and the rights of victims.

Sentencing Considerations  
In considering the appropriate disposal, this court is acutely aware of the complex interplay of factors involved. The public interest mandates an unequivocal response to repeated, calculated thefts from retail businesses, as such conduct destabilises the local economy, undermines community confidence, and inflicts real distress on often vulnerable workers.

I have also given weight to your personal circumstances, previous convictions, and the recommendations of professionals. The delayed guilty plea and the relatively modest scale of financial loss, while factors favouring mitigation, are tempered by the persistence and audacity of the offending. The absence of violence is not in doubt, but the psychological impact upon victims should not be underestimated.

It is worth emphasizing the language found in the Sentencing Council’s guideline foreword which acknowledges that acquisitive offending “although low-level in isolation, can have serious cumulative effects on victims, communities and public services.”

In keeping with established authority, including R v. Carter [2023] EWCA Crim 887, sentencing must be proportionate, reflect the circumstances of the offence and offender, and serve the three principal aims of sentencing: punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation.

The court regards community-based remedial sanctions as generally preferable where feasible, but the scale and persistence of offending here merits close scrutiny of any custodial threshold. Given your limited
