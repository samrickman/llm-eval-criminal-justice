IN THE CROWN COURT AT EASTBOURNE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13158  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. Cavendish QC  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence in relation to a representative charge of theft, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, reflective of multiple incidents of retail theft over the course of an extended period. The offences pertained to a series of shoplifting events occurring between December 2023 and February 2025 across various retail establishments within the Eastbourne and Hastings districts.

Procedural Background and Context  
You were initially arrested on 2 March 2025 pursuant to local policing response coordinated with the Eastbourne Business Crime Reduction Initiative (BCRI). This initiative, established in 2018 under the Home Office pilot scheme for combatting retail crime, has long served as a focal point for multi-agency cooperation, bringing together police officers, local authority trading standards, security firms, and retailers themselves. While the BCRI has been commended in formal reports for its innovative intelligence-sharing platforms and prompt dissemination of offender alerts, it is pertinent to observe that systemic challenges persist. These include overreliance on volunteer redundancy measures, inconsistent data entry practices, and the perennial problem of fragmented jurisdictional boundaries.

In discharging its duties, the BCRI compiled a detailed offender profile based on security footage from several convenience stores, aided by witness statements collected by store managers who themselves work under significant operational pressures. These pressures notably include reduced staffing levels often attributable to budget cutting and staff turnover, which in some instances restrict staff from acting as frontline anti-theft agents, heightening vulnerability to persistent theft. The court acknowledges the significant burdens borne by retail workers in this environment, many working hours unmatched elsewhere and frequently encountering distressing situations.

The preliminary hearing occurred on 31 March 2025 at Eastbourne Magistrates' Court, where bail was set conditional on your not attending certain locations, pending transfer to this Crown Court. Due to a backlog occasioned by strike action affecting court staff in May and subsequent postponements related to Legal Aid funding decisions, the matter was only listed for plea and trial preparation on 12 August 2025. 

It bears noting that the Legal Aid Agency’s response to the defence’s application for funding expert reports was notably protracted on this occasion. The defence requested approval for a forensic psychologist with expertise in off-the-street acquisitive offending and impulsivity, a request that was initially deferred with ambiguous feedback. Only after persistent correspondence over several weeks was approval granted, albeit close to the scheduled hearing date. This delay representationally underscores the systemic difficulties faced by defendants who seek to properly prepare their cases in a timely manner. The court is obliged to register its concern at this recurring pattern, which directly impacts defendants’ rights to adequate representation and to a fair trial.

The plea and trial preparation hearing saw you submit an initial not guilty plea, which, following service of comprehensive prosecution evidence, including enhanced CCTV analysis and detailed retail loss valuations, was changed to a guilty plea late last month, on 10 August 2025. This late admission of guilt, while acknowledged, attracts only limited reduction in sentence discount, given the timing and circumstances. The authorities’ position, as advocated by Ms Eleanor Vance, prosecuting counsel, is that the timing resulted in a necessity to prepare for trial that consumed disproportionate court and witness resources.

The Crown affirm that this suite of incidents contributed cumulatively to a deleterious effect on the small businesses involved, exacerbating economic strain already evident due to the continuing economic shocks in post-pandemic East Sussex, including rising logistical costs, inflationary pressures on supply chains, and labour shortages. Small firms in particular bear a disproportionate brunt from shrinkage, which when combined with increasingly complex insurance landscapes and rising crime rates, threatens their viability and by extension local employment.

I wish to acknowledge the efforts of the Eastbourne Retail Support Network, a volunteer-led organisation dedicated to victims of shop theft and retail fraud. They have provided detailed impact statements and have assisted staff affected by these offences, offering counselling and liaison with law enforcement. Their contribution, whilst unpaid and unfunded, is a vital component of the wider support infrastructure, which itself operates under chronic funding shortages.

The State also called upon PC Lewis Montgomery, who testified regarding multi-agency investigative procedures in the matter, including the use of digital forensic methodologies to corroborate visual identifications. The immensity of digital data scrutinised—ranging from store CCTV to mobile telephone geolocation cross-referencing—highlights the increasingly complex intersection of criminal justice and emergent technological capabilities. Witness testimony particularly emphasised the strains placed on dedicated cyber forensic officers, who balance such duties alongside the ongoing growth in cybercrime investigations.

An illustrative parallel may be drawn with the seminal case of R v. Kempthorne [2019] EWCA Crim 1215, which while unrelated on the facts, established significant precedent regarding the admissibility of digital triangulation evidence. The Court held that such evidence, whilst powerful, necessitates meticulous chain-of-custody documentation and validation to withstand challenge. The procedural safeguards outlined in Kempthorne were scrupulously observed in the present matter.

It is an accepted axiom, developed through decades of jurisprudence, that offences of theft—particularly when occurring in a retail context—do not exist outside the broader social milieu. There is an observable complexity in the interplay between economic precarity, substance misuse, and criminogenic environments. To that end, it is useful to recall the observations made in R v. Jansen [2020] EWCA Crim 789, concerning the contributory role of housing instability and untreated mental health disorders in persistent acquisitive offending. Although distinct from the present proceeding, Jansen sets a touchstone for considering the multi-faceted nature of offending behaviour.

Examination of Case Law and Sentencing Guidelines  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the statutory foundation for offences of theft, including shoplifting. The sentencing approach for such offences is informed by the definitive offence guideline issued by the Sentencing Council, last updated in June 2023, which emphasises culpability, harm, and the defendant’s previous record.

The Sentencing Council’s guideline explicitly recognises that persistent offending, especially when involving multiple thefts over time, aggravates culpability. The impact on victims, particularly small retail enterprises already operating on slim margins, informs the harm calculation beyond mere financial figures.

The Court's consideration necessarily extends beyond statutory provisions to examine pertinent appellate decisions. For instance, R v. Aldridge [2021] EWCA Crim 1237, concerned a serial offender whose persistent shoplifting included tactics such as concealment under bulk clothing and tactical re-entry to premises post initial apprehension. Although the monetary values were low, the Court upheld a sentence of community custody to signal the cumulative impact of persistent offending.

Parallel findings emerged in R v. Connors [2018] EWCA Crim 2356, concerning stolen goods of modest value acquired from a series of charity shops, which resulted in custodial custodianship reflecting the offender’s prior record and failure to engage with rehabilitative programmes.

Whilst not directly on point, I also note the judgment in R v. Thorne [2017
