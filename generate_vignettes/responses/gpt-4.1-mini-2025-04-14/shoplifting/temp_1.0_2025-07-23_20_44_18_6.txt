IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/20137  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J. McFARLANE  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you are before this court for sentence concerning a charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge is representative, arising from a series of incidents which occurred intermittently over an eighteen-month period in the West Midlands jurisdiction. This court has had the benefit of detailed reports, voluminous disclosure, and a contested evidential record that culminated in a guilty plea at the outset of this sentencing hearing.

Procedural History  
Your initial appearance at the magistrates’ court occurred on 2 March 2025, at which time your case was committed to this court following the refusal of your application for summary trial. The prosecution proceeded by indictment, not least because of the volume of incidents and the loss value aggregated across multiple retail premises, all situated largely within Birmingham city centre and surrounding neighbourhoods. The decision to elevate the matter beyond summary jurisdiction reflected the prosecution’s view — supported by local crime intelligence — that these offences form part of an organised pattern of conduct rather than isolated opportunistic acts.

The Better Case Management (BCM) process, introduced to expedite trial preparation and promote early resolution, has operated here with moderate effectiveness. The initial plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 29 April 2025, in accordance with the indicative timetable under the Criminal Procedure Rules (CPR). It was evident at that stage that the defence wished to explore extent and validity of the forensic evidence, which included CCTV footage, store incident reports, and forensic examination of recovered property. Adjournments were granted to allow authorities to assemble comprehensive exhibits, including digital forensic reports that proved complicated by data extraction issues from proprietary store security systems.

It is worth setting on record here the difficulties routinely encountered in such investigations. Retail security systems often employ a wide range of technology standards — from dated analogue cameras to modern IP-based networks — resulting in partial or fragmented footage. Synchronisation of timestamps across multiple cameras, some of which save files locally rather than to central servers, requires painstaking cross-checking by law enforcement digital analysts. This in turn prolongs case preparation and imposes burdens on both prosecution and defence, as well as courts.

To compound matters, the volume of acquisition-related offences in the Birmingham district has seen an upward trajectory in recent years, driven in part by economic pressures and social dislocation in post-industrial areas. The West Midlands Police Retail Crime Coordinator noted in correspondence dated 15 January 2025 that the rate of shoplifting offences reported to their unit had increased by approximately 14% over the previous twelve months, with striking concentrations in local convenience stores and independent pharmacies.

A noteworthy procedural problem encountered in this case was the prolonged delay attributable to the Legal Aid Agency’s approval process for funding expert reports. On 1 June 2025, the defence applied for sanction to instruct an independent forensic psychologist, citing concerns over potential underlying impulsivity and risk factors associated with your offending. The application languished for over six weeks, only securing authorisation on 16 July following numerous chaser emails and intervention by defence counsel. The delay frustrated timely case progression and necessitated the rescheduling of the sentencing date originally set for 31 July.

This kind of inertia has become tragically common. The backlog in Legal Aid referrals risks undermining not only the rights of defendants to fair proceedings but also the court’s ability to effect efficient justice. Delay corrodes evidence, distresses victims, and burdens scarce court resources. The bureaucracy of legal funding bodies, once intended to guarantee stewardship of public funds, now functions too often as an arbitrary barrier.

The evidence before the court included victim impact statements tendered on behalf of affected retailers. Managers from three small businesses — two independent retailers and one branch of a national convenience store chain — testified to the deleterious impact of persistent shoplifting on staff morale, customer confidence, and financial viability. One statement from the proprietor of Greenfield Chemist described how stock losses had prompted the closure of an early morning shift previously staffed by a vulnerable single mother. Another, from a Tesco Express supervisor, recounted the introduction of restrictive customer limits on certain items, herself disclosing increased stress among employees fearful of repeat encounters.

These personal accounts bring into sharp relief the human dimension of what might otherwise be dismissed as “low-level crime.” The economic damage, while individually modest, aggregates into a meaningful disruption of community provision, especially given the reliance many local residents place on these outlets for everyday essentials.

Turning to expert assessments, the court has before it the forensic psychological report dated 8 September 2025, prepared by Dr Katherine Shaw, a consultant forensic psychologist instructed by the defence. Dr Shaw notes the absence of any formal psychiatric diagnosis but identifies patterns consistent with impulsive behaviour and limited capacity for self-regulation under stress. She suggests factors such as social isolation and economic insecurity may have contributed to the offending cycle. The report recommends engagement with cognitive-behavioural interventions targeting acquisitive offending cognition, though candidly acknowledges your inconsistent prior engagement with support services.

It is of concern that despite repeated offers of assistance from local outreach schemes, including the Community Reintegration Project (CRP) and the Birmingham Homelessness Prevention Unit, you have elected not to commit consistently to intervention. Letters from outreach workers, written on 12 August and 2 September this year, express frustration that contact was often missed or terminated without explanation. These exchanges reflect the real-world complexities faced by agencies operating at capacity amid increasing demand.

At 34 years of age, your criminal record includes three prior convictions for theft-related offences, dating back a decade. These were dealt with variously by community orders and suspended sentences, the most recent in 2021 following an incident involving attempted shoplifting from a department store in Solihull. On that occasion, you complied with the conditional discharge terms and avoided custody; however, vigilance is warranted in light of your subsequent conduct.

In analogous regard, I reference the recent judgment in R v. Dunkley [2024] EWCA Crim 581, which endorsed a custodial sentence for repeat shoplifting by a defendant with a similar criminal profile. Dunkley stressed the necessity for clear deterrent messaging where prior sanctions and support failed to yield behavioural change. Similarly, R v. Harwood [2023] EWCA Crim 1133 highlighted the aggravated nature of persistent acquisitive offending involving vulnerable retail staff as a significant sentencing consideration.

It is notable that your offending occurred notwithstanding prior warnings and various community resolutions issued by local police. Despite this, you resumed the same offending pattern within a matter of months, underscoring a degree of disregard for legal boundaries that courts must take seriously.

It is appropriate also to observe the wider societal context. The city of Birmingham, like many urban conglomerates, has witnessed a marked rise in visible street homelessness and unauthorised encampments. Local reports indicate a growing and entrenched population experiencing rough sleeping, drug dependency, and mental health challenges. The visible prevalence of street begging and related antisocial behaviours has placed increased pressure on law enforcement and social services alike, complicating strategies to address underlying causative factors effectively.

There is, moreover, the continuing debate over the adequacy of statutory housing provision, with repeated calls from mayoral offices and social justice organizations for systemic reform. The housing shortage has precipitated an increased risk environment which, while not causal in itself, undeniably intersects with the incidence of low-level acquisitive crime.

It may be helpful to the court to reflect briefly upon the role of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership operating in Birmingham. Established in 2016, this cross-sectoral body aims to coordinate frontline responses to retail crime, encompassing police, council officials, business improvement districts, and retailers themselves. The Partnership facilitates information sharing, victim support, and contributes to offender profiling. Its efficacy, however, is contingent on available resources and institutional memory — both of which are under continual strain.

Recent minutes of the Partnership’s coordinating committee, dated 20 May 2025, highlight challenges in maintaining consistent data flows, particularly in relation to transient offenders and cross-border retail networks. While the Partnership has implemented targeted deterrent patrols in key precincts, sustained impact remains elusive.

Amid the sentencing process, I have had the opportunity to read a series of letters from third parties submitted on your behalf. These include character references from your sister, Ms Bernadine Harris, and from project staff at the Eastside Community Trust. Both commend your periodic demonstrations of responsibility and wish to see you supported to break the cycle of offending.

While such endorsements are appreciated, they must be weighed against the caveat that systemic support only yields positive outcomes where the individual engages in good faith. The public interest demands careful balancing of rehabilitation prospects with protection of potential victims.

As to the harms occasioned, the psychological toll on retail staff, noted above, constitutes an aggravating element. Though no physical violence was inflicted, feelings of vulnerability and distress — particularly among lone workers or younger staff — should not be understated. This court is aware that extended stress due to repeated exposure to theft incidents can precipitate absenteeism, even exit from employment in some cases, thereby undermining livelihood and community cohesion.

While you did not act in concert with a persistent gang or organised group, your reliance on familiar tactics — including concealment of items in clothing layers and distraction techniques — suggests a degree of premeditation inconsistent with spontaneous lapses.

Let it be emphasised that shoplifting, far from being a victimless offence, carries repercussions that extend well beyond financial loss. It erodes trust, inflates prices, and strains social relations.

The offence before the court falls properly within the sentencing framework set out by the Sentencing Council. The guideline for theft offences demands consideration of culpability, harm, personal mitigation, antecedents, and risk. The aggravating features here include persistence, previous warnings, and the emotional impact on victims. The mitigating factors are limited primarily to your expressed circumstances and pre-sentence engagement.

It is pertinent to mention the observations found in the pre-sentence report compiled by probation officer Ms Lara Newton, dated 10 September 2025. Ms Newton assesses you as presenting a moderate risk of reoffending, with some protective factors related to family support and motivation to obtain employment. The lack of sustained compliance with treatment or support services tempers that assessment. Recommendations include compulsory attendance on an accredited rehabilitation programme targeting acquisitive offending and active engagement with housing support.

Mr H, the court recognises the strain that this process and your personal history may have imposed. The court also acknowledges the collective efforts of all involved agencies, despite the scarcity of resources and increasing caseloads. I place on record my thanks to the staff at Birmingham Retail Crime Unit, probation service, and charitable organisations involved.

I must further note that there are no outstanding applications for reports or representations, and that the prosecution and defence have made comprehensive submissions on sentence. Credit is given for your admission of guilt at the earliest opportunity today.

The determination before me is thus to impose a sentence that reflects both the seriousness of the offending and the prospects for rehabilitation. The overall objective is the protection of the public while providing appropriate opportunities for your disengagement from criminal behaviour.

This sentencing hearing took place in Court 6 at Birmingham Crown Court. A full transcript has been made in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. I advise you that notification of your right to appeal under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968 has been given and that any appeal must be lodged within 28 days.

No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are applicable.

I now adjourn for a pre-sentence report to be prepared and considered before the formal sentencing date is fixed. This report should address fully the matters of risk, welfare, and the suitability of community-based interventions, including potential utilization of an unpaid work requirement or a rehabilitation activity order.

These are the orders of the court.
