IN THE CROWN COURT AT BARKING  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/08439  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. Remington  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction on a charge under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to persistent shoplifting offences carried out at various retail establishments in the Barking, Dagenham, and Ilford areas over an extended period. The offending behaviour comprises a sustained and deliberate course of dishonesty involving multiple instances of theft from retail premises.  

Procedural History and Case Management  
You were initially arrested on 10 July 2025 pursuant to an investigation involving Barking Local Policing Unit, the Outer London Retail Crime Initiative, and commissioned data analysts from the Metropolitan Forensic Services Division. The inquiry incorporated CCTV review, transaction auditing, and coordination with security personnel across an estimated twelve premises primarily consisting of convenience stores and small pharmacy outlets. Notable is the coordination of data-sharing between borough inspection units under the framework of the London Business Crime Prevention Scheme (LBCPS), which sought to streamline intelligence-led policing in property offences. Your arrest followed a series of targeted surveillance and corroborative witness interviews.  

Following your charge on 17 July 2025, the case was committed to this Crown Court. Initial mention was set for 24 July 2025 for plea and trial preparation, with Legal Aid representation secured for you via the Duty Solicitor scheme. A plea hearing was convened on 14 August 2025, at which time you entered a not guilty plea. The matter was subsequently adjourned to allow for expert psychiatric assessment and additional disclosure of evidential material from the Crown.  

I note the court experienced administrative delays due to staffing shortages within the Probation Service, as noted in correspondence dated 29 August 2025 from the Barking Probation Team Manager, Ms Cynthia Rowley. These shortages, as she attests, have resulted in backlogs, impacting both report preparation and offender supervision capability. There is also a broader context of mounting pressures on the criminal justice system here in the capital’s eastern boroughs, exacerbated by staffing absences and concurrent strikes affecting court staff during July and August 2025, which contributed to extended listings.  

Your legal team applied on 3 September 2025 for further time to consider additional character references submitted from a local charitable organisation, the Barking Community Support Network (BCSN), which specializes in outreach to marginalised persons affected by economic hardship and housing instability. After consideration, the application was granted, and the sentencing hearing set for today’s date. I appreciate Mr Oliver Jenkins, appearing for the defence, for his timely submissions and collaborative approach throughout. The Crown is represented by Ms Fiona Marlow.  

The Crown’s barrister confirmed during opening submissions that your guilty plea was entered at trial following the hearing of a Newton 2 appeal on 10 September 2025, challenging the basis of specific aggravating facts pleaded in the indictment. The conviction itself was secured on the strength of decisive CCTV evidence and corroborating witness statements. I record my thanks to all parties for their composed and professional conduct in court.  

Contextual Commentary on the Societal Climate and Multi-Agency Collaboration  
It is necessary, before turning to the particulars of your offending, to note the broader societal dynamics within which cases such as this unfold. Recent years have witnessed a discernible rise in acquisitive offences, particularly shoplifting, coinciding with economic instability, rising homelessness, and the escalating cost of living. That these trends are neither isolated nor novel is reflected in research by the London School of Economics, which observed a correlation between socioeconomic pressures and low-level property crime rates in urban settings. While such analyses do not excuse criminal conduct, they provide a lens through which one may understand the complexity of motivations and contributing circumstances often present in defendants before this court.  

This court is cognizant of and grateful to the efforts of frontline organisations, such as the East London Retail Coalition (ELRC), who have engaged extensively with businesses affected by theft and abuse. Their work, detailed in their 2025 annual report, underscores the cumulative impact of recurrent crime on local economies and small business viability. Moreover, the ELRC's collaboration with local law enforcement to establish reminder signage, staff training on theft deterrence, and rapid response protocols represents a laudable commitment to preventative strategies. While not dispositive in sentencing, these initiatives illustrate the interconnected ecosystem of policing, local government, and community response essential in properly addressing acquisitive crime.  

Concurrent to these developments is the observed strain on mental health services, as reported by the National Health Service England, noting significant waiting lists for adult Community Mental Health Teams and challenges in the provision of timely interventions for complex multi-factorial cases—this is pertinent given the evidence before the court regarding your own mental health and substance use history. I will return to this matter in due course.  

The court also records the ongoing administrative challenges faced by the Legal Aid Agency in processing applications for expert assessments. In the present case, an application for funding for an independent forensic psychological evaluation suffered delay of approximately six weeks due to procedural ambiguities and resubmissions, notwithstanding assurances of prioritisation. This inefficiency, regrettably, remains widespread and threatens to undermine timely access to justice, a point the court reiterates here without hesitation.  

Legal and Sentencing Framework  
The statutory offence with which you are charged arises under the Theft Act 1968, section 1, a provision that continues to form the foundation for the prosecution of dishonesty offences. The relevant guidance for sentencing is contained within the Sentencing Council’s definitive edition for Theft and Handling, issued in 2020, supplemented by ongoing case law elucidating the principles to be applied.  

These principles emphasise proportionality, focusing on the culpability of the defendant and the harm caused or risked. Importantly, guidelines differentiate between isolated incidents and sustained courses of conduct, the latter attracting greater severity commensurate with the breadth and persistence of offending. Credit is available to those who plead guilty early, fully engage with the court process, and demonstrate genuine remorse, but this is discretionary and influenced heavily by the timing and nature of the plea.  

I will mention for illustration that the case of R v. Finegan [2019] EWCA Crim 1217, concerned with repeat theft from independent retailers, highlighted the necessity of sentences that reflect not only economic loss but the psychological impact on retail workers subjected to repeated victimisation. Likewise, in R v. Dunlop [2022] EWCA Crim 335, the Court stressed the importance of targeted interventions addressing the underlying drivers of acquisitive offending, endorsing a balance between deterrence and rehabilitation. These cases, while not identical to the present, set a useful judicial backdrop.  

Lastly, I draw attention to section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which provides the statutory framework for reduction in sentence for guilty pleas. The timing of the plea in this case — entered at the Newton hearing — substantially diminishes the potential for significant discount.  

Narrative of the Offending Behaviour  
The facts of the case are as follows:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

The Defendant systematically targeted small retail establishments, exploiting periods of low staffing and utilising both physical concealment methods and social distraction. Incident logs detail repeated removal of consumer goods including over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, hygiene products, and convenience food items, accompanied on occasion by the use of false payment gestures. Though no acts of violence or coercion took place, the thefts were executed with a level of deliberation not typically associated with opportunistic shoplifting.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Security personnel at several outlets testified to the pattern of offending, noting anxieties about the prospect of confrontation or escalation. Managers resorted to adjusting work patterns and increasing vigilance, measures which have resource implications extending beyond financial loss.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

A key aggravating factor was the persistence of the conduct despite prior interventions, including community resolutions and informal warnings. Repetitive attending and offending within recognised “high-risk” retail corridors constituted a clear disregard for prior cautionary measures and public expectation of lawful behaviour.

Probation and Psychiatric Assessments  
The court has had the benefit of a comprehensive pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Helen Cartwright, a Senior Probation Officer for the Barking and Dagenham Probation Office. Ms Cartwright’s report sets out your personal history, social circumstances, and assessed risks of reoffending and harm. The risk assessment utilises the OASys framework, which identifies medium risk of reoffending and necessitates structured intervention to reduce recidivism effectively.  

Moreover, the court considered the psychiatric evaluation conducted by Dr Miriam Swain, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, whose detailed report dated 11 September 2025 lends valuable insight into your cognitive, emotional, and behavioural profile. Dr Swain notes indications of moderate depressive symptomatology compounded by generalized anxiety, though no psychotic features or major mental disorder were diagnosed. The psychological profile suggests episodic impulsivity and difficulties with frustration tolerance, which may have contributed to your offending pattern. Dr Swain also comments on an inconsistent engagement with support services and an absence of sustained therapeutic input, highlighting the missed opportunity for earlier intervention.  

I acknowledge, as Dr Swain’s report emphasises, the multifactorial nature of your challenges, including socioeconomic disadvantages and housing instability. However, the report also stresses your capacity for behavioural change, conditional upon acceptance of responsibility and meaningful engagement with rehabilitative schemes.  

The court is reminded of the pervasive resource constraints impacting mental health services described in the NHS England Adult Mental Health Long Term Plan update (April 2025), with particular reference to the surging demand in London boroughs bordering Barking and Dagenham. Waiting times for initial assessment in Community Mental Health Teams exceed twelve weeks on average, and access to specialist forensic psychology provision remains limited. These systemic factors are an unpalatable reality but do not negate the obligation of offenders to seek help where it is available.  

Collateral matters of note  
Aircraft noise complaints were registered with the Barking and Dagenham Council in mid-2023. While unrelated, the persistence of such nuisances has been documented in environmental health reports, highlighting community distress and the broader context of urban living pressures. It is emblematic of the myriad disturbances affecting the quality of life in the borough but bears no relation to your case beyond illustrating the complexity of cumulative social stressors.  

The court has also reviewed submissions from the Barking Neighbourhood Watch Association, exhorting improved community policing and surveillance measures to address the proliferation of petty crime and antisocial behaviour. These submissions, while heartfelt, relate to broader policy and resource allocation decisions best addressed by local government agencies.  

I note an incident of criminal damage to a church noticeboard recorded in Ilford in November 2024, involving graffiti tags and minor property damage. This had no association with you or your known associates, but the court references it here to provide an account of the local crime environment.  

Likewise, a co-defendant in an unrelated fly-tipping prosecution in East Ham was, unlike you, found guilty of unlicensed waste disposal resulting in environmental contamination. This matter, prosecuted under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, is referenced purely as context and shares no procedural or substantive connection to your proceedings.  

Similarly, a separate case concerning possession of a bladed article on school premises in Walthamstow was the subject of a recent appeal heard by this court; it provides no legal parallel but merits recognition as part of the locality’s recent judicial activity.  

Submissions and Observations  
Mitigation on your behalf emphasises your unstable housing situation, unemployment, and expressed remorse. Letters of support — including from the Barking Food Bank and the Community Link Housing Association — attest to your character challenges and efforts towards stabilisation. Your counsel submits that these factors, together with the psychiatric report, justify consideration of a community sentence with intensive supervision and access to structured programs addressing financial management, impulse control, and employment readiness.  

The Crown, by contrast, highlights the deliberate nature of the thefts, the impact on small business proprietors, and the failure to desist following warnings and alternative disposals. It urges the court to consider a sentence reflective of deterrence and the need to uphold public confidence in retail security.  

Your credit for the late guilty plea is acknowledged but restricted by the timing and circumstances under which it was entered.  

Final Observations and Sentencing Direction  
This court takes seriously the pattern of sustained dishonesty and the consequences for victimised businesses and their staff. While acknowledging your personal circumstances and the challenges detailed, it is incumbent upon the court to ensure that any sentence properly accounts for public protection, the gravity of the offending, and the need for effective rehabilitation.  

A pre-sentence report has been prepared and will be pivotal in tailoring the most appropriate sentence to your needs and risks, including any ancillary requirements directed towards mental health intervention, cognitive skills development, and community reparation.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Barking. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be lodged with the appropriate registers. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal the sentence within 28 days, pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
