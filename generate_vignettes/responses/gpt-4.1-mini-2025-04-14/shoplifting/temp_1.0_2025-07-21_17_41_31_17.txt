IN THE CROWN COURT AT CHELSEA  
R v. MR H  
Case No. CR2025/13458  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge C. F. LANGLEY  
Filed: 3 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for an offence of theft, specifically multiple counts of shoplifting, an acquisitive crime which has been committed on numerous occasions across a protracted period. The offending relates to actions taking place predominantly in the boroughs of Chelsea and Kensington, spanning from late 2023 through to the spring of 2025. The court’s task today is to impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the offending, the impact upon victims, and wider considerations of public protection and rehabilitation.

Procedural Matters  
This matter has a somewhat lengthy procedural history. Your case was initially listed for a Plea and Case Management Hearing (PCMH) on 19 May 2025 before His Honour Judge M. R. Downing, following your charge in April. Owing to delays in obtaining Legal Aid funding for your chosen defence solicitors and subsequently a request for an expert psychiatric report, the matter was adjourned on two separate occasions. The second adjournment was also necessitated by a late disclosure relating to CCTV footage from an independent convenience store, which required further review.  

The Legal Aid Agency’s response to these applications was marked by delay and lack of clarity, which regrettably hindered earlier progress. These bureaucratic inefficiencies are all too common in contemporary criminal proceedings and impose significant strain on court resources and those involved in the judicial process. The necessity for timely provision of expert evidence, particularly in cases involving potential mental health considerations, cannot be overstated; judicial efficiency and defendants’ rights alike depend upon it.  

At the plea stage, you initially indicated a not guilty plea on 7 June, however, following the service of further prosecution evidence and investigative interviews, you entered a guilty plea at the rescheduled hearing on 21 August. As the authorities and this court have observed previously, late guilty pleas, especially when tendered shortly before trial, limit the extent of credit for remorse and procedural economy available under established sentencing principles.  

The Essential Background of Retail Theft Prosecution  
It is a familiar feature of retail crime prosecutions that investigations require a multiplicity of cross-agency input. Often, these are low-level, seemingly isolated incidents which, only after painstaking collation of data, reveal a pattern of deliberate and repeated offending. As is well documented in the literature and case experience, the investigatory burden placed upon local policing units, backed by business crime partnerships, is elevated when the offender systematically targets multiple premises using a range of covert tactics. 

The partnership approach adopted in the Chelsea area comprises store owners, local police officers, forensic analysts and community safety officers working in concert. While ostensibly a model of co-operation, this apparatus is not immune to the pressures of funding shortages, shifting personnel, and administrative backlogs which impact on investigative timeliness and the quality of evidence assembled. In this respect, the finding of well-maintained CCTV systems and detailed stock-loss logs from several involved shops was something of a procedural boon, enabling prosecution witnesses to provide coherent testimony. It is regrettable, however, that some retailers remained reluctant to engage fully, citing fears of retaliatory behaviour or a sense of futility given the low value of stolen goods.  

The case law surrounding theft and specifically shoplifting offences is well-established, with the Court of Appeal providing guidance balancing public protection with offender circumstances. The court notes authorities such as R v. Kilmartin [2018] EWCA Crim 321, which emphasises the need to consider both the economic loss and the psychological impact on victims, being staff and owners alike.

General Observations on Shoplifting Trends  
This court has, over recent years, reflected upon the changing landscape of acquisitive crime. There are signs—confirmed by data analysis from the Metropolitan Police Service—that shoplifting has increased in frequency, yet the threshold for prosecution has shifted. This phenomenon partly results from capacity constraints in the criminal justice system and competing priorities such as serious violence and cybercrime, which command both public and institutional attention.

Research into repeat offenders within acquisitive crime cohorts reveals a recurring profile: individuals often deal with complex social issues, including unstable housing, mental health conditions, and substance misuse. Despite these factors, repeated theft cannot be excused nor minimised in its effect; it contributes to a broader deterioration in public confidence in retail environments and an unsettling of community norms. The presence of coordinated schemes to disrupt offenders via civil recovery or banning orders reflects the systematic approach now taken.

The court acknowledges the contribution of probation services in compiling a detailed pre-sentence report which explores your background and risk factors. The report highlights that, while housing issues have been persistent, your engagement with voluntary sector supports has been limited and inconsistent. Without access to stable accommodation or employment, the risk cycle of reoffending remains material, unless effective intervention is provided.

Legal Aid and Expert Reporting Challenges  
It is necessary to record an ongoing criticism of the Legal Aid Commission’s administrative handling of requests for expert psychiatric input in criminal cases involving vulnerable defendants. In this case, an application for the instruction of Dr Gwen Richards, a forensic psychiatrist with experience in non-custodial rehabilitation pathways, was met with repeated queries demanding supplemental material and clarification of the proposed instruction’s scope. Approval was only granted six weeks after initial submission, resulting in delay to the preparation of defence mitigation and assessment.  

Dr Richards’ report, now before the court, details an evaluation conducted over April and July of this year. While she finds no evidence of severe psychosis or persistent risk factors associated with serious violence, the psychiatrist notes traits consistent with impulsivity and a history of depressive episodes. The report recommends structured psychological support and the possibility of cognitive-behavioural therapy, subject to your engagement. This advice aligns with emerging rehabilitative trends within acquisitive offending to prioritise therapeutic support over short custodial sentences where feasible.  

It remains a vexed point as to the adequacy of mental health resource availability for offenders with co-morbid social deprivation and impulsivity profiles. Waiting lists for NHS commissioned services in London boroughs exceed normative targets; thus, swift assessment and treatment are often not realistic. This contributes to the perpetuation of offending behaviours without effective intervention.

Discussion of Relevant Case Law  
Turning to precedent, this court finds it appropriate to review the principles set out in the seminal case of R v. Blackwood [2019] EWCA Crim 1759, where the offender engaged in multiple acts of shoplifting over a three-year period, leading to significant losses and repeated distress to victims. There, the Court of Appeal elaborated upon the proportionality of custodial sentences for sustained acquisitive offending, emphasising the need for public deterrence balanced against rehabilitation prospects.  

Additionally, the decision in R v. Fenwick [2021] EWCA Crim 1234 considered the circumstances in which late guilty pleas reduced—and did not negate—credit for remorse. It criticised defendants who maintain not guilty pleas through intensive preparation of insubstantial defences, only to tender guilty pleas immediately prior to trial, thus impeding efficiency and prolonging victim distress.

Victim Impact and Community Harm  
Representatives from two of the affected stores have submitted victim impact statements, which have been received and considered. One store manager describes a palpable atmosphere of unease stemming from a recurrent presence of theft perpetrators. Staffing pressures were exacerbated, as employees frequently felt compelled to intervene or monitor suspected offenders, leading to elevated stress and concerns about personal safety.  

The economic cost, while not extraordinary individually, cumulatively undermines profitability and occasionally leads to store closures or reductions in opening hours. Anecdotal evidence suggests some businesses have invested in increased surveillance, security personnel, or specialist loss prevention services, all of which contribute to retail shrinkage costs which ultimately fall on consumers and legitimate customers.  

It is important also to acknowledge statements from the Chelsea Business Crime Partnership, outlining joint efforts to combat acquisitive crime through awareness campaigns and referral pathways for offenders. These complex and resource-heavy initiatives underscore the broad impact such offences have beyond simple value of stolen goods.

Unrelated But Notable Case Developments  
In a separate though contemporaneous matter, the court has been informed that a co-defendant on an unrelated matter involving aggravated burglary in the Chelsea area remains at large following a failed bail appearance. This case, while unrelated, has attracted local attention and contributed to community unease about crime levels in adjacent wards. However, it must be emphasised that no such allegations are made against you, Mr H.  

Similarly, reference has been made to an environmental crime case, where Mr Lambe was convicted of fly-tipping hazardous waste in a greenbelt area outside London. The sentence imposed included immediate custody and substantial remediation costs. Such regulatory offences, while unrelated to theft, reinforce the judiciary’s broad concern with persistent disregard for community standards.

Medical and Social History Considerations  
A letter from the community mental health nurse team has been submitted expressing regret at your intermittent engagement with their services. The nurse highlights episodes of transient depressive symptoms but no history of hospitalisation or psychotropic medication compliance. There is mention of social isolation and financial hardship but an absence of known substance misuse, which complicates risk profiling.  

Conversely, a submission from Your Housing Support Officer emphasises the ongoing challenge of securing stable accommodation for you and the consequential stress this places on your capacity to desist from offending. The housing instability almost invariably precedes episodes of legal involvement.

Statutory Framework and Sentencing Guidelines  
The Theft Act 1968, section 1, remains the foundational statute under which the offence is charged. The offence is aggravated by a course of conduct, rather than an isolated incident, which brings into play sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council. The guideline instructs the court to consider the value of property stolen, the level of planning and sophistication, the harm to victims, and personal mitigating factors.  

Within the guidelines, custodial sentences become increasingly warranted as offending escalates beyond trivial values and when there is persistence despite warnings. Aggravating factors include use of concealment, targeting vulnerable premises, and causing distress or repeat victimisation. Mitigation may arise from early guilty pleas, genuine remorse, personal circumstances, and potential for rehabilitation.

Closing Procedural Observations and Remarks  
This hearing has been conducted in open court with the full attendance of prosecution and defence counsel. I am grateful to Ms Yasmin Patel for her diligent and measured advocacy on behalf of the Crown and to Mr Denton Wells for his professional representation. Court staff and the usher team are also acknowledged for their efficient management despite recent refurbishments to the court layout causing some minor disruption.  

Finally, the court reiterates its regret at the length of time this case has taken to reach sentencing. The impact of systemic delays, particularly in the realms of funding allocation for expert advice and the uneven pace of evidence collation, remains a concern for all participants in the justice system.  

The court will reserve judgment on sentence until receipt and consideration of the final pre-sentence report, which should address the full suite of sentencing considerations, including your background, current social and mental health situation, and the feasibility of interventions designed to reduce reoffending risk.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 3 September 2025, in Court 5 at Chelsea Crown Court. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in strict accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to all appropriate agencies. You, Mr H, are advised of your statutory right of appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions in force pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 in relation to these proceedings. No order as to costs is made at this stage.  

These are the orders of the court.
