IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHWARK  
R v. MR H  
Case No. SWK-CR-2025/04521  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. L. MORGAN  
Filed: 30 August 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction for theft by shoplifting, brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, which has been admitted and of which you stand convicted, occurred over a sustained period from June 2023 through to April 2025. The offences were concentrated in several retail outlets within the Southwark and surrounding boroughs, predominantly targeting mid-range pharmacies and convenience stores.

Procedural and Investigative History  
The proceeding against you commenced with your arrest on 19 May 2025 pursuant to police enquiries instigated by retail loss prevention units and supported by the Southwark Business Crime Reduction Partnership. This multi-agency group coordinates intelligence between local police officers, store security teams, council licensing departments, and other stakeholders, with the aim of tackling persistent and organised acquisitive offending within this district. The case assembled against you was, as is unfortunately typical in such investigations, the product of considerable administrative and operational effort over several months.

This court is aware from experience that investigations of this nature require painstaking time-consuming work; reviews of surveillance footage, forensic examination of recovered property, and collation of statements from often transient or part-time retail staff. This often takes months due to the volume of evidence and competing demands on overstretched officers. The notion that retail theft is minor or trivial belies the considerable resource burden placed upon the police and business community alike.

Of note, your arrest followed several weeks of covert police observations and the use of judicially authorised devices for tracking digital communications and location data. Such a degree of investigation is neither routine nor indiscriminate but signals the seriousness with which the authorities regarded your conduct as warranting an escalated response.

The realities of prosecuting shoplifting offences underscore a persistent paradox within the justice system. The ostensibly limited harm caused by individual incidents conceals the aggregate disruption engendered by serial offenders. Indeed, the offending here was not episodic or accidental, but manifested in an organised pattern which blurred the lines between opportunism and strategic theft. This distinction is not one of technicality but of principle and public interest.

I pause here to note that this jurisdiction has witnessed a notable surge in such acquisitive offences over the past five years. Data collected and analysed by crime analysts working for Southwark Police and corroborated by independent research reveal that repeated theft from retail premises presents a mounting challenge. This phenomenon affects not only local economic stability but also the wellbeing of retail workers, many of whom are vulnerable to harassment, intimidation, or unwarranted suspicion.

Parallel to criminal proceedings, the victim impact statements presented by managers and staff at the affected premises reflect far-reaching consequences. Beyond immediate financial loss, there has been increased anxiety among employees, operational disruption, and in some cases, downsizing of opening hours. The cumulative effects reverberate within local communities often already grappling with social deprivation and insecurity.

It is the unfortunate reality that many retailers are reluctant to report such offences, perceiving the administrative burden and limited criminal justice outcomes as deterrents. This underreporting compounds the challenges faced by law enforcement and the courts, which must rely increasingly on robust intelligence and the cooperation of private victims.

The case was listed initially for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 14 June 2025 but was adjourned to allow defence counsel time to secure further instructions and to prepare submissions regarding the potential engagement of an expert in forensic psychology. This was granted, albeit not without some delay occasioned by protracted correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency concerning funding authorisations — a development regrettably emblematic of wider systemic issues within publicly funded defence provision.

The Legal Aid delays touched on here are a matter of ongoing concern to this court. The imposition of administrative impediments not only hinders the defence’s ability to present a fully informed case but also places unfair pressure on defendants who may remain in procedural limbo, uncertain of the timeline for resolution. It cannot be overstated how such procedural inertia undermines confidence and compromises promptly delivered justice.

Defence submissions included a request to admit a series of letters from voluntary sector agencies involved in housing and welfare assistance. While these letters suggest a degree of hardship and unsettled accommodation, there was also evidence that offers of support from some local agencies had been declined, raising complex questions about personal agency and responsibility.

The issue of engagement with support services often arises in cases of repeated acquisitive offending. While courts are sympathetic to the socioeconomic challenges which may underpin such conduct, it remains a fundamental requirement that defendants show some degree of proactive effort to address underlying causes. Persistent recidivism without meaningful attempts at rehabilitation cannot be condoned.

Historical and Legal Context  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the cornerstone statutory provision governing offences of dishonest appropriation. Though sentencing guidelines have evolved over the decades since their inception, the core principle remains the assessment of culpability, harm caused, and the offender’s antecedents.

The Sentencing Council guidelines for theft offences explicitly recognise a spectrum of offending from spontaneous acts through to organised campaigns involving collusion or coercion. The present matter falls into the latter category, implicating sustained, deliberate offending behaviour.

Relevant jurisprudence includes R v. Jennings [2019] EWCA Crim 1754, wherein the Court of Appeal underscored the deterrent necessity of immediate custody in repeated theft cases involving commercial premises. Similarly, in R v. Palmer [2023] EWCA Crim 2039, the courts reiterated that protracted patterns of acquisitive crime impose disproportionate burdens on victims and public services alike, necessitating sentences reflecting this cumulative harm.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

It is also pertinent to recall the observations in R v. Dyer [2021] EWCA Crim 1604, concerning the proximity of such offending to sensitive venues. Though not directly applicable here, the principle that context and setting can aggravate culpability remains of note. The jury in such cases is often rightly tasked with balancing the offence’s objective harm against any mitigating factors.

This court is also conscious that the Better Case Management (BCM) framework has altered the procedural landscape. Introduced with the intention of expediting trials and reducing unnecessary delays, BCM insists upon early case indication and timely disclosure. In the present proceedings, case progression adhered to BCM protocols with a commendable degree of diligence among the prosecuting and defence teams, notwithstanding the aforementioned external funding delays.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Notably, the court recalls the decision of R v. Briggs & Anor [2020] EWCA Crim 2311, stratifying the degrees of culpability between co-defendants in joint theft operations. While there are no co-defendants in this matter, the absence of such complicity does not diminish the seriousness attached to repeated individual culpable conduct.

The court is also familiar with the phenomenon of late pleas in acquisitive crime cases. As per the guidance elucidated in R v. Armitage [2018] EWCA Crim 657, the timing and surrounding circumstances of guilty pleas markedly influence any mitigating credit. Late admissions, whilst beneficial to procedural efficiency, often attract significantly less reduction.

Psychiatric and Professional Reports  
Dr Rowena Fletcher, consultant forensic psychiatrist, undertook a comprehensive assessment of your mental state on behalf of the defence. Her report, dated 11 August 2025, notes the absence of any major mental disorder or psychotic illness but identifies traits suggestive of attention-deficit hyperactivity difficulties and impulsivity. There is also mention of a mild alcohol dependency not amounting to clinical severity.

Dr Fletcher remarked in her report that while your circumstances include periodic instability and socio-economic disadvantage, these factors do not rise to the threshold of mitigating psychiatric impairment. The report further emphasises that engagement with support services to address impulsivity or substance use has been minimal.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Probation’s pre-sentence report, prepared by Ms Naomi Ellis and dated 28 August 2025, highlights the absence of any previous custodial sentences but confirms a history of previous convictions for low-level theft offences and breach of bail conditions. The report suggests a medium level of risk of reoffending and emphasises concerns about your limited engagement with accommodation and welfare provision.

Ms Ellis notes that while you have a network of family contacts, their involvement has been inconsistent, and your transient housing status exacerbates instability. The report recommends consideration of a community order incorporating an unpaid work requirement and cognitive skills training, in addition to exploration of housing support services.

Correspondence from the Southwark Housing Support Unit and the Southwark Drug and Alcohol Recovery Service have been filed, which corroborate the probation assessment regarding your irregular engagement with voluntary supports.

Victim and Community Impacts  
The impact upon the staff and management of the ravaged premises cannot be overstated. This court has reviewed statements from store managers who describe a growing culture of unease among their workforce, some suffering from anxiety with subsequent absenteeism. The cumulative loss to the local businesses involved, while modest in absolute terms, when aggregated with previous incidents, represents a significant economic and emotional toll.

The Southwark Retail Crime Partnership has provided a detailed report outlining the broader community harm arising from such offending, including increased insurance premiums for local shops, staffing challenges caused by reduced morale, and the diversion of scarce policing resources.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

The court recognises the professionalism and restraint exhibited by retail staff throughout, many of whom endured repeated exposure to offending conduct without complaint or retaliatory behaviour. The impact statements emphasise that the trauma experienced by employees was often invisible but profound.

Notwithstanding the obvious harm inflicted upon the victims, this court must temper its sentence to reflect not only punishment, but rehabilitation and forward public protection. It is critical therefore that the disposal imposed has a proportionate and appropriate rehabilitative element designed to reduce recidivism.

Additional Observations  
It is noted for completeness that one of the retailers involved experienced a separate incident in 2024 involving the theft of copper cabling from adjacent railway lines—an offence wholly unconnected to your conduct. Officers assigned to that investigation described the increasing challenge posed by thefts of infrastructure components across the capital. Furthermore, a co-worker of one of the victims was separately arrested for possession of controlled substances, underlining the complex milieu of multiple intersecting minor offences that characterise urban environments but bear no causal link to the defendant.

This court also takes judicial notice of the administrative difficulties occasioned by recent procedural reforms. The refurbishment of Court 6 at Southwark, which accommodated this hearing, resulted in some minor disruptions to scheduling and the availability of court clerks and translation services. Although no such delays materially affected the present case, they form part of a wider picture of systemic strain on criminal justice administration.

Likewise, this court acknowledges with regret the ongoing incapacities of local NHS mental health services, which continue to experience unprecedented waiting lists and staffing shortages, impacting early intervention and diversion efforts. The cumulative consequences of such shortages ripple outwards, entrenching cycles of disadvantage and potential offending.

Case law unrelated to the present facts but providing judicial context includes, for example, R v. Fenton [2017] EWCA Crim 1223 relating to affray after a pub altercation, and R v. Gale [2016] EWCA Crim 1780 concerning fly-tipping offences on green belt land. While these cases provide valuable legal principle regarding sentencing frameworks across criminal categories, none bear directly upon the circumstances of the offences committed by Mr H.

In the same vein, the court is mindful of the observations in R v. Hopkins [2019] EWCA Crim 1344 on the importance of timely guilty pleas in sentencing discount, yet notes that the defendant here pleaded guilty only after the primary case witness testimony had been formalised, resulting in limited credit.

Conclusion and Directions  
In summary, the offending for which you now stand convicted consists of a sustained course of theft from retail premises, marked by persistence, opportunism, and clear disregard for previous warnings and community resolutions. The cumulative detrimental impact on the economic viability and psychological welfare of local businesses and employees is undeniable.

The psychiatric and probation reports underscore a profile of a defendant not suffering from serious mental illness but exhibiting impulsivity, unstable living conditions, and minimal engagement with available support services. These factors suggest a risk of reoffending absent prompt and effective intervention.

The court will therefore proceed cautiously in balancing factors of mitigation and aggravation. Having regard to the Sentencing Council’s guidelines on theft, the totality principle, and relevant appellate authority, it remains essential that the sentence must both express the public denunciation of such conduct and maximise prospects for your rehabilitation.

I hereby direct the preparation of a further pre-sentence report by probation services to include an assessment of the feasibility of a community order incorporating offender rehabilitation requirements specifically targeted at acquisitive offending behaviour, alongside possible inclusion of cognitive skills programmes and unpaid work. The report should also address housing stability options and drug and alcohol support, to the extent they are appropriate and available.

Pending receipt of that report and any supplementary representations, sentencing is adjourned to a date to be fixed, anticipated within the next eight weeks, in order that this court may impose an informed and proportionate sentence.

I take this opportunity to record my thanks to Ms Fiona Craven, who appeared for the Crown, and to Mr Nathaniel Cole, who represented the defence pursuant to a valid Legal Aid representation order. I likewise acknowledge the professional effort of Southwark Probation, the Retail Crime Partnership, and the forensic psychiatric service who have assisted the court in understanding the parameters of this case.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 30 August 2025, in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Southwark. This hearing has been conducted and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction will be transmitted accordingly. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged save as otherwise ordered or required.

These are the orders of the court.
