IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIARWOOD  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13409  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. L. Fenwick  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced following your conviction on a representative count of theft by shoplifting under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charge relates to an extended pattern of offending involving multiple retail premises within the Briarwood Metropolitan area, occurring over the period from November 2023 through February 2025. This period was marked by behaviour which the Crown asserts was deliberate, sustained, and systematic.  

Procedural History  
Your arrest occurred on 6 March 2025, following a complex multi-agency enquiry involving cooperation between Briarwood Police’s Commercial Crime Unit, the Retail Watch Network specific to the Briarwood district, and input from the Briarwood Community Safety Partnership. This joint effort was prompted by numerous reports from independent shops and local chain pharmacies, which had documented an apparent rise in theft-related losses. The initial reports, which at first seemed isolated and minor, were gradually connected by meticulous collation of CCTV footage, store transaction records, and witness statements.  
It is all too common for offences of this nature—perceived as “low-value” or “victimless" by some—to consume disproportionate police resources. The efforts involved a considerable allocation of personnel time for reviewing imagery, securing evidence packages to the standards of disclosure compliance, and facilitating interviews with a range of retail staff, many of whom are part-time or temporary employees with limited training in handling such incidents. These realities underscore the often underestimated cost—both monetary and human—of low-level acquisitive crime on public agencies already burdened with multiple competing priorities.  
Charges were formally laid on 20 March 2025, consolidating what had initially been multiple discrete reports into a single indictment reflecting the course of conduct. The case proceeded under the Better Case Management protocol, with case progression hearings held on 15 April and 24 June. The latter was adjourned upon receipt of a request from your defence team to commission a full psychiatric evaluation and a pre-sentence report.  

Your representation has been provided under a Legal Aid order. As is frequently regrettable, the Legal Aid Agency’s administration in the management of your case created avoidable delays, particularly with regard to approval for the psychiatric expert instructed. The initial request, submitted on 29 April, was not approved until 10 June, following multiple escalations and the intervention of senior practitioners. Such procedural inertia, while not unique to this case, contributes detrimentally to the timely administration of justice. The court trust that all relevant agencies engaged in your case will take heed.  

The plea and trial preparation hearing took place on 12 August, when you entered a guilty plea on the charge as framed. It is to be noted that your admission came at a relatively late stage, after substantial disclosure and witness preparation had been completed. The effect of this delay on victims—retail staff who provided statements and, in some cases, volunteer at-risk post to storefronts—is regrettable. The court recalls the clear guidelines set out in R v Lambert [2020] EWCA Crim 895, where the Court of Appeal underscored the principle that reductions for guilty pleas should be adjusted according to the timing and sincerity of the plea.  

Mr H, your case draws attention to wider operational pressures experienced by multiple agencies. The Briarwood Probation Service reports significant challenges in caseload management, with a persistent shortfall in both qualified officers and specialist staff able to provide interventions specifically tailored to acquisitive crime. Mental health services, both statutory and voluntary, similarly report waiting times that often exceed clinically recommended limits, with some individuals waiting in excess of six months for initial assessment. Such systemic strains inevitably affect the availability and timeliness of meaningful rehabilitative opportunities for offenders such as yourself.  

It is also relevant to mention, albeit peripherally, that this court received a letter from the Briarwood Homelessness Action Group, dated 8 September 2025, expressing concern over rising street homelessness in Briarwood town centre during the same period in which your offending occurred. Though there is no direct link to your case, it illustrates the broader social malaise against which offences such as yours unfold.  

In preparing for today’s sentencing, I acknowledge the efforts of both prosecuting and defence counsel. Ms Elaine Cartwright, for the Crown, conducted her submissions with customary professionalism. Mr Darren Cole, for the defence, articulately presented mitigating factors and sought to contextualise your offending within a framework of personal difficulties and social disadvantage. The court thanks them both for their contributions.  

Legal Framework and Relevant Authority  
The offence of theft is governed by the Theft Act 1968, with key elements established through seminal case law including R v Morris [1984] AC 320 and affirmed in later authorities. The sentencing council guideline last revised in 2024 remains applicable, emphasising the need for proportionality, appreciation of harm, culpability, and offender background.  

A number of reported decisions, though dissimilar in precise facts, provide useful touchstones. In R v Peake [2019] EWCA Crim 1048, the Court upheld a custodial sentence for a repeat shoplifter who targeted small independent grocers, stressing the cumulative effect of repeated thefts on vulnerable traders. In R v Ashcroft [2021] EWCA Crim 1711, the Court considered the effect of mental health history in shop theft, noting that while illness may moderate culpability, it does not obviate a custodial sentence where reoffending risk remains high. In R v Dawson [2018] EWCA Crim 773, the Court emphasised that persistent acquisitive offending warrants sentences promoting deterrence in the wider community.  

It is further worth observing that R v Barron [2023] EWCA Crim 1789 distinguished the impact of pleas entered early at the first hearing from those entered at a late stage, penalising tactical delays that impose unnecessary costs on the system and victims alike.  

By contrast, cases involving co-defendants with markedly different circumstances have also come before this court. While these may be illustrative, they bear no direct bearing on your own sentencing. For instance, R v Shepherd [2022] EWCA Crim 2104 involved a co-defendant in a violent aggravated burglary and is entirely unrelated to the shoplifting offences before me. Similarly, a prior matter involving your sister, now subject to unrelated proceedings in the magistrates’ court, has no influence here.  

Facts of the Offending  
The facts as presented are as follows:  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

You trafficked items including toiletry products, over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, and modestly priced confectionery. The offences were characterised by a pattern of nocturnal visits, exploitation of staff distraction during busy hours, and the use of concealment techniques including the utilization of bags and layered clothing.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Impact statements received from retail staff testify to a climate of fear and discomfort. One full-time shop assistant at a local supermarket reported refraining from working alone during evening shifts for fear of encountering you again. Another notes a reduction in morale and an increase in staff anxiety. These are not trivial concerns. The cumulative welfare of retail workers suffers under repeated incursions of theft.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Despite multiple warnings and a prior community resolution process engaged in mid-2024, your return to similar offending was noted, undermining prior rehabilitative opportunities.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Repeated thefts impacted not only revenue but also led to increased security expenditure and staffing reallocations, diverting resources from other community priorities. The Briarwood Business Crime Reduction Partnership supplied reports highlighting rising incident rates and community concern, reinforcing the adverse social impact of your actions.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Your conduct was observed to involve some degree of planning and opportunistic timing. Various surveillance logs demonstrate a consistent geographical pattern of offending and deliberate targeting of premises with minimal on-site security and high footfall.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Your defence asserts that financial hardship and housing instability have contributed to your conduct; however, as the probation report underscores, you have declined multiple offers of support including budgeting and employment advice and have not taken up voluntary counselling referred through the Briarwood Support Network.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Expert and Risk Assessments  
Dr Marissa Halstead, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided an independent report dated 5 September 2025. She concludes that you do not meet criteria for a serious mental illness, but displays underlying personality difficulties consistent with impulsivity and borderline traits. Her recommendation is for psychotherapeutic intervention in a community setting, alongside structured support addressing financial management and substance use risks.  

The Briarwood Probation Service pre-sentence report, authored by Officer Gregory Mills, notes your four previous convictions for theft-related offences and emphasises a medium risk of reoffending absent intervention. It notes particular concern regarding your refusal to engage with voluntary services and suggests that without custodial supervision or enforced intervention your offending may persist.  

This court recognises the limitations imposed by systemic resource constraints. Mental health and social care services in the Briarwood district are under significant pressure, resulting in waiting lists and referral delays. While this is not a justification for offending, it must be understood as part of the broader context within which your case arises.  

The court has also received correspondence from the Briarwood Retail Association expressing anxiety about ongoing shoplifting in the area and documenting increased expense on security measures, staff training, and loss prevention initiatives. These inputs reinforce the broader societal consequences attendant to your conduct.  

The Probation Service advised that any community-based disposition would require close monitoring, engagement with behaviour modification programmes, and support with accommodation stability. Unpaid work orders and rehabilitation activity requirements may form part of an effective package, if practicable.  

I would add that, while the professional reports are comprehensive, their recommendations must be tempered with candid recognition of the likelihood of engagement. Persistence, consistency, and evidential commitment from you will be crucial to any chance of rehabilitation.  

Sentencing Considerations  
The court’s primary concerns remain public protection, offender rehabilitation, and maintaining public confidence in the criminal justice process. Your offending demonstrates clear intent, persistence, and disregard for prior warning—factors which collectively elevate culpability.  

At the same time, this court is mindful of your personal circumstances, including reported housing instability, unemployment, and some degree of psychological vulnerability. These are not presents of kindness, but realities that necessitate consideration under the Sentencing Council’s guidelines and the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 in relation to rehabilitation and preventative measures.  

The late timing of your guilty plea—after extensive preparation and exposure—reduces but does not extinguish the credit to which you may be entitled. Your plea conserves court time to a limited degree but comes at significant cost to witnesses and victims. The principles enunciated in R v Langdale [2024] EWCA Crim 987 and R v Fenton [2021] EWCA Crim 633 are germane.  

The absence of violence or threats is not a mitigating factor sufficient to outweigh the aggregate seriousness of repeated, persistent theft targeted at vulnerable businesses and workers. The deterrent effect of sentencing in such cases must be underscored for the cohort of potential offenders observing the response and the community at large.  

Consideration will also be given to the appropriateness of any ancillary orders—including compensation for victims where financial loss is demonstrable, and enforcement conditions attached to any community order to promote engagement with specified interventions.  

The court is conscious that recent years have seen an increase in the frequency and audibility of minor property crimes, often linked to economic pressures, social dislocation, and emergent patterns of exploitation. The cross-sector burden—on police, retail, social services, and voluntary agencies—is a factor that cannot be ignored. This case exemplifies the ongoing challenge of balancing compassion, pragmatism, and justice.  

The court records that you maintain inconsistent contact with family members, several of whom are currently engaged with unrelated criminal proceedings. The prison record of a cousin, unrelated to your conduct but noted in Gladstone v. Henderson [2015] EWCA Crim 990 as relevant for contextual understanding, does not assist or detract from the assessment here. Your defendant profile is accordingly based on your actions alone.  

Lastly, I note, in passing, that this court held a hearing in Court 4 on 17 July 2025 concerning an entirely separate matter involving organised fly-tipping that resulted in significant environmental damage to Briarwood Green Belt land. That offence bears no relation to your case but demonstrates the range and diversity of challenges faced locally.  

Conclusion and Directions  
Having carefully weighed all relevant factors, including the aggravating and mitigating circumstances; the submissions of counsel; the factual matrix as established; the expert reports; and the probation assessment, I am not in a position to pass immediate sentence today. I require completion and consideration of a full pre-sentence report to enable an informed, proportionate, and personalised sentencing determination.  

This report should encompass a thorough risk assessment, referral to available rehabilitative programmes—particularly those addressing acquisitive offending and impulsive behaviour—and verification of accommodation status. I will also request supplementary information concerning aftercare available through social and voluntary services engaged in Briarwood.  

I therefore adjourn sentence until 5 November 2025, at which time this matter will be relisted.  

The sentencing hearing this day was conducted in open court, with all parties present. I record my thanks to Ms Cartwright and Mr Cole for their submissions and professional conduct. I must reiterate the court’s dissatisfaction with the delays imposed by procedural hurdles within the Legal Aid system, which continue to impair the fair and timely administration of justice.  

Your attendance today and your acknowledgement through plea are noted, but do not ameliorate the gravity of your offending or the need for a robust response. This court considers that while rehabilitation remains a priority, custody is likely to be considered in the final sentence, reflecting public protection and deterrence.  

These sentencing remarks are issued on this 18th day of September 2025, in Court 5 at Briarwood Crown Court. The proceedings are recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged at this stage. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
