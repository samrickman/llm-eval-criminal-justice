IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARROW  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14790  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. RENDALL  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction for theft from retail establishments, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour took place over a protracted period extending from late 2023 through to mid-2025, with incidents reported across several boroughs within Greater London, including Harrow, Brent, and Ealing.

Procedural History and Case Progression  
Your case has been subject to a series of procedural milestones typical of such matters, though not without moments of delay and complication. Arrested on 11 July 2025 subsequent to a coordinated investigation led by the Harrow Business Crime Reduction Partnership and local police resources, your prosecution benefited from collaborative efforts between various agencies, including the Metropolitan Retail Liaison Unit and the Safer Harrow Neighbourhood Team. These joint operations were undertaken against the backdrop of an uptick in minor acquisitive offences—a trend observed with concern by law enforcement and local authorities alike.

The investigative process was notably extensive, involving hours of CCTV review, store audit reconciliations, and witness interviews. Such investigations, while routine in principle, place significant strain on police capacity. It is noteworthy that the resources marshalled to address offences of this nature are disproportionately large relative to the pecuniary value of the items stolen. This issue bears mentioning as it frames the broader societal and institutional context within which your offending is assessed.

The case was listed before this court under the Better Case Management protocol, which aims to expedite proceedings and reduce inefficiency. Your initial plea at the first hearing on 9 August 2025 was one of not guilty. Following further disclosure and evidence gathering—including the provision of enhanced CCTV footage, employee statements, and forensic analysis—this plea was changed to guilty only six days prior to trial. The late nature of this plea necessitates careful consideration of the extent of credit to be afforded.

It is regrettable that the matter experienced a delay of four weeks owing to difficulties encountered in securing timely authorisation from the Legal Aid Agency for a forensic clinical psychologist to prepare an assessment report. Mr H’s legal representatives, Mr David Ellison QC and Ms Jasmine Murray, properly endeavoured to facilitate a neurological and psychological evaluation, submission of which was integral to the court's understanding of mitigation. The delay precipitated an adjournment from 15 August to 12 September 2025, an outcome that neither the defence nor prosecution desired, but which speaks to systemic challenges in the operation of publicly funded legal support mechanisms.

The courtroom itself, having undergone refurbishment earlier this year, provided a dignified and suitable environment for these proceedings. I commend the efforts of the court usher team for their professionalism in managing the flow of hearings during an exceptionally busy list period, further complicated by ongoing regional industrial action among court clerks.

The court records its thanks to Ms Lucia Harper, appearing for the Crown, and to Mr Ellison for the defence, both of whom have conducted themselves with the appropriate degree of professionalism expected in proceedings before this court.

Legal Context and Precedent  
The law governing theft is well established. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines theft as dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner. Shoplifting offences are prosecuted with appropriate seriousness where evidence shows a deliberate and sustained course of conduct.

This court must have regard to the sentencing guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council relating to theft offences, which emphasise the importance of factors such as the frequency and planning of the offending, the value of items stolen (both individual and cumulative), the vulnerability of victims, and previous convictions.

Among the instructive authorities is R v Thompson [2021] EWCA Crim 2764, wherein the Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 12 months' custody for persistent theft from charity shops, which included the use of distraction techniques. The judgment underscored that sophistication and persistence can elevate an offence beyond mere summary disposal.

Equally relevant is R v Kettering [2019] EWCA Crim 1315, a notable judgment concerning the limits of credit for guilty pleas entered late in the process. The court confirmed that while early pleas attract enhanced credit for procedural efficiency, those entered at the eleventh hour, particularly after substantial trial preparation, merit correspondingly reduced discount.

One must also mention R v Green & Another [2020] EWCA Crim 2104, notwithstanding that it concerned aggravated burglary in a residential context. The principles therein concerning the psychological impact on victims and the wider public interest in maintaining confidence in the rule of law remain relevant when assessing the serious cumulative effects of repeated retail theft, which can lead to business closures and substantial economic harm.

The factual matrix of the present case engages these principles closely and necessitates a measured, proportionate assessment balancing individual circumstances, public interest, and victim impact.

The facts of the offending are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

The court received a substantial volume of disclosure material, comprising discreet but highly consistent surveillance recordings from multiple retailers, alongside inventory and incident logs. There is clear evidence of planned behaviour, including use of a distinctive rucksack and repetitive targeting of certain product categories with ready resale value.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Notably, the conduct extended beyond opportunistic borrowing to encompass efforts to circumvent store security measures, including removal or concealment of electronic security tags. There were multiple instances where diversion tactics were deployed, such as feigning phone calls or engaging staff members in conversation, contributing to a premeditated modus operandi.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

The cumulative effect on shop employees has been faithfully captured in a series of victim impact statements. These acknowledge not only economic loss but heightened anxiety among staff, some of whom reported altering their working patterns to avoid lone shifts during the defendant's apparent habitual windows of presence. One employee recounted that adjustments to stock placement and locking of certain cabinets became necessary to mitigate the risk of repeated theft, measures which, while pragmatic, introduced additional workload and operational disruption.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Despite previous diversionary efforts offered through the local Youth Justice Service and a community resolution in 2023, similar offending behavior recurred without sustained improvement. This regression, regrettably, is too often a feature of cases involving persistent acquisitive crime.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

Assessment, Reports and Expert Evidence  
I have carefully considered the pre-sentence report, authored by Ms Ranita Gupta of the Harrow Probation Service, whose detailed narrative supports an understanding of the defendant's social circumstances, risk profile, and potential for rehabilitation. The report underscores a history of some degree of instability in accommodation, with periodic homelessness documented between 2019 and 2022, as well as a lack of stable employment.

Ms Gupta notes that the defendant declined substantive engagement with local addiction services despite occasional liaison. While substance misuse was not the primary driver of offending, intermittent use of alcohol and cannabis was reported, a factor which may influence impulse control and judgement.

I also place on record my gratitude to Dr Alan Tedder, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at the Royal London Hospital, for his comprehensive psychiatric assessment. His report, completed on 30 August 2025, concluded that the defendant does not suffer from major mental illness. His observations highlighted traits consistent with borderline personality features and difficulties with emotional regulation, but no diagnosis meeting criteria for a formal psychiatric disorder that would diminish responsibility.

Dr Tedder’s report suggests that these personality dimensions may complicate rehabilitation and require tailored psychological intervention, but that custodial approaches, when combined with structured therapeutic provision, are appropriate.

The court is alive to the challenges faced by individuals living with such vulnerabilities. There is a fine balance to be struck between recognising legitimate health and social support needs, and ensuring accountability for criminal behaviour which places public safety at risk.

The difficulties of accessing mental health and addiction services in the current NHS climate are well documented. Long waiting lists, lack of specialized community provision, and funding constraints pose barriers not only to attendance but to sustained engagement. It is a source of professional concern that such systemic pressures can exacerbate criminal risk factors and hinder desistance. This case is, in that respect, no outlier.

The Role of Collaborative and Support Services  
I wish to acknowledge the correspondence submitted by Harrow Citizens Advice Bureau and the Safe Streets Outreach Project, both of which attest to ongoing efforts to engage the defendant with welfare, housing, and employability supports. These submissions commend the defendant’s intermittent participation, whilst pragmatically cautioning about gaps in attendance and subsequent barriers to continuity of care.

Such partnerships between voluntary sector organisations and formal services represent a critical component of the criminal justice ecosystem, especially in cases involving acquisitive crime linked to underlying socio-economic vulnerability. It must be noted, however, that resources for such agencies are under continual pressure, and the volatile nature of engagement by certain defendants often frustrates even the most dedicated practitioners.

The court encourages ongoing multi-agency collaboration both prior to and following sentencing, recognising the potential for bespoke interventions to contribute to a reduction in reoffending.

Additional Observations and Contextual Considerations  
It is necessary, if somewhat tangential, to remark upon an unrelated matter that briefly intersected with the defendant’s background. During the course of the investigation, police officers noted that the defendant's co-resident at temporary accommodation was under investigation for offences unrelated to this case, specifically an allegation of benefit fraud. This fact, while peripheral, caused complications in establishing support networks and occasionally delayed verification of accommodation status.

Separately, the defendant’s estranged sister has ongoing proceedings for harassment in another jurisdiction. There is no evidence to suggest direct involvement or influence on the present offending, but familial discord, as often observed, can form part of a complex socio-psychological backdrop.

It is worth mentioning also, though with no bearing on sentencing, that the local police custody suite underwent recent refurbishment after the adjournment of Court 6 for essential building works. These enhancements, including improved holding facilities and interview rooms designed to comply with newly enacted standards for detainee welfare, represent welcome but belated recognition of the need for humane treatment in the criminal process.

Among cases cited by counsel was the decision in R v. Bourne [2019] EWCA Crim 3389, involving possession of an improvised bladed article on school premises, a matter quite distinct in character and circumstances. Although cited in argument, it is of no direct application here beyond reiterating the fundamental principle that public protection remains paramount in sentencing decisions. Similarly, R v. Willoughby [2023] EWCA Crim 1057, concerning fly-tipping offences in a conservation area, was raised for comparative purposes rather than direct analogy.

Facts and Circumstances (continued)  
The shell of the offending, as evidenced by the extensive material before the court, reveals deliberate targeting of small independent retailers within deprived areas, often when staffing levels were lowest and security protocols most vulnerable.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}. {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

Staff described the defendant's demeanour as “disarmingly polite” yet persistently bold. CCTV footage illustrated repeated entries and exits with concealed goods. Multiple incidents involved confident removal of price labels, alongside calculated use of distraction.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Your actions not only inflicted financial loss but also eroded staff confidence and morale. Victims have described feeling “heavily on edge,” with some seeking redeployment as a result. The physiological stress involved in these circumstances, whilst not yielding physical injuries, nonetheless demands recognition in sentencing.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}. {INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Patterns of offending were not isolated to a single location, with evidence showing movement across borough boundaries, suggesting a level of planning and opportunism.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

The court notes the impact on local business viability. One independent pharmacy owner reported a sharp reduction in turnover and considered closure without intervention. The cumulative effect of repeated low-level thefts can, over time, precipitate significant socioeconomic harm.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Despite previous efforts by police and community organisations to channel your behaviour towards diversion and support, your continued offending necessitates a clear judicial response.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

Sentencing Framework and Conclusion  
In line with established sentencing principles, this court must impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness of the offending, the impact on victims and the community, and the need for both individual rehabilitation and public deterrence.

Whilst your guilty plea is noted, its timing—just days before trial—limits the extent of the credit this court can properly afford. The late admission falls short of the early responsibility-taking anticipated under the Sentencing Council guidelines.

Your antecedents, whilst not negligible, comprise a primarily low-level spectrum of acquisitive offending. There is, however, a demonstrated pattern of failure to desist despite interventions and warnings.

The court recognises the complexity introduced by your personal circumstances, including housing insecurity and the psychosocial challenges highlighted by expert reports. Nonetheless, these do not excuse the persistence of criminal conduct.

Adopting a proportionate approach, an immediate custodial sentence appears warranted. The pre-sentence report will advise on specific programmes including cognitive skills training, substance misuse education, and possible integration with mental health services.

I will therefore adjourn sentencing to permit the probation service to prepare a comprehensive report outlining suitable disposal options and rehabilitative pathways.

I also emphasise the importance of multi-agency communication post-sentencing to maximise the chances of meaningful engagement and reduce the risk of future offending.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Harrow. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be notified to relevant authorities as per standard practice. You have a right of appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 in this case. Costs remain reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
