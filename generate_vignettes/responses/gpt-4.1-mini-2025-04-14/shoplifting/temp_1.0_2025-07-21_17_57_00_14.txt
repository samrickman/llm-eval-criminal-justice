IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARTLEPOOL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. H2026/04527  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. Hanaway  
Filed: 17 September 2026  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence on a representative charge of theft involving multiple incidents of shoplifting committed over a period extending from November 2024 through to May 2026. The offences took place at various retail outlets within the confines of Hartlepool town centre and adjacent suburban districts. This is a matter that engages not only the statutory provisions contained within the Theft Act 1968 but also attracts the court’s consideration under the Sentencing Council’s guidelines relating to theft and repeat acquisitive offending.

Procedural History  
The matter first came to official attention following a co-ordinated notification from a consortium of retailers operating under the banner of the Hartlepool Business Crime Partnership, a quasi-statutory body convened to address patterns of repeated retail crime through intelligence sharing and mutual support. The original reports, dating back to late 2024, referred to a spate of petty thefts predominantly affecting convenience stores and small pharmacies—premises situated proximate to local transport nodes and pedestrian thoroughfares. It is a regrettably familiar phenomenon whereby individual acts, ostensibly isolated, constitute fragments of a larger behavioural pattern only discernible after meticulous aggregation of evidence.

The investigation was assisted by the Hartlepool Metropolitan Police Retail Crime Unit, who compiled CCTV footage, witness statements, and stock loss analyses over a period of several months. Crime recording officers were tasked with the formidable challenge of reconciling multiple streams of information from disparate sources—unfortunately not an uncommon feature of acquisitive crime investigations given the variable quality and quantity of available evidence. This speaks to the considerable operational demands placed on police units in the face of rising reports of retail theft, which now account for a substantial portion of the investigative caseload in many urban centres.

It is worth pausing to acknowledge the work of the Business Crime Partnership in this regard. While the structure of such bodies is sound in principle—linking retailers, law enforcement, and local authority representatives—the reality is that their efficacy is often diminished by limited funding, fluctuating membership, and the inscrutable complexities of data protection regulations. Nevertheless, their contributions have, on occasion, proven instrumental in identifying offending patterns and supporting prosecutions, as in the present case.

Mr H was arrested on 12 June 2026 after a targeted operation involving plainclothes officers and local CCTV monitoring. Accounted for within the investigative chronology is the application for a judicial warrant authorising the examination of mobile telecommunications data to verify location and corroborate witness accounts. These investigative powers, although subject to rigorous safeguards under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, have become an indispensable tool in addressing offences where tangible evidence is often elusive.

The defendant initially denied the accusations upon interview but was confronted with compelling forensic evidence, including recovered items bearing his fingerprints and distinctive clothing traces linked to the shoplifting events. The matter was listed at Hartlepool Crown Court for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 14 July 2026. At that hearing, a not guilty plea was entered but subsequently altered to guilty on 3 September 2026 following the Crown’s disclosure of additional evidence and scheduling of witnesses.

This course of conduct—frequent in modern acquisitive crime prosecutions—raises the court’s concerns regarding the timing and sincerity of guilty pleas. As set out in R v. Barwise [2021] EWCA Crim 1055, the availability of a sentencing discount for a guilty plea must be premised upon an early and genuine acceptance of responsibility. The principle, firmly established across appellate jurisprudence, is designed to encourage expeditious resolution whilst recognising the demands placed upon victims and the public purse. Pleas entered belatedly, particularly those tendered shortly before trial commencement, attract substantially reduced mitigation.

I also note the decision in R v. Gaynor [2019] EWCA Crim 971, where the Court of Appeal underlined the adverse impact on witness welfare and court resources caused by late pleas in cases involving protracted investigatory processes. The courts must, accordingly, adopt a proportionate approach in weighing credits for pleas according to their timing and the attendant circumstances.

It is imperative to highlight the broader environment within which offences of this genre unfold. Retail theft, particularly when recurrent, can engender considerable distress amongst employees, many of whom are subjected to added scrutiny, repeating disruption, and, in some instances, threats of violence. The psychological burden borne by staff in victimised outlets has been well documented, affecting morale and retention. The court acknowledges with respect the victim impact statements provided by several store managers, including those from the Hartlepool Cooperative Pharmacy and the Cornerstop Convenience Store, which detail the financial losses and safety concerns engendered by Mr H’s actions.

As has become tragically routine within acquisitive crime proceedings, delays were occasioned by administrative factors, notably repeated applications to the Legal Aid Agency for authority to instruct a forensic clinical assessment, which were met first with requests for clarification and then protracted deferrals. It is lamentable that such bureaucratic impediments continue to hamper case progression. The court places on record its disappointment with the ongoing performance of the Legal Aid Agency in this regard, which has been the subject of substantial criticism in recent scholarly legal commentaries and parliamentary oversight reports. These delays threaten to undermine the right to a fair and timely hearing, compounding the distress of all involved parties.

I wish to acknowledge the diligent efforts of the Hartlepool Probation Service and, in particular, Ms Fiona Gibbons, whose probation report dated 10 September 2026, was both detailed and professionally composed. Ms Gibbons’ observations provide a nuanced appraisement of Mr H’s personal circumstances and identify salient risk factors relating to impulsivity and social deprivation, though she notes a limited engagement with referred community support services. The report advises that any sentence should incorporate rehabilitative elements tailored to Mr H’s criminogenic profile, including substance misuse intervention and cognitive behavioural therapy modules.

The psychiatric evaluation conducted by Dr Christopher Myles, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, whose report was submitted on 9 September 2026, advises that while Mr H does not meet diagnostic criteria for any major mental disorder, there are indications of emotional dysregulation and a borderline personality organisation which may underpin some of the offending behaviours. Dr Myles specifically highlights that these traits have been exacerbated by longstanding unemployment and housing instability, factors that are recognised within the criminal justice system as complicating the rehabilitation process.

It is important to situate these findings within the broader literature on mental health and offending. In R v. Cawthorne [2023] EWCA Crim 1122, the Court accepted that while personality disorders may not mitigate culpability in the same manner as serious mental illness, they do warrant consideration in the formulation of sentencing and risk management strategies. That case involved a defendant convicted of aggravated burglary with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, who was sentenced to an extended community order
