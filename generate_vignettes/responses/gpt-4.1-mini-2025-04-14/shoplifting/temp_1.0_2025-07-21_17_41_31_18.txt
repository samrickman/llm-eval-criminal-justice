IN THE CROWN COURT AT LEICESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13729  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. M. HARTLEY  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in respect of a series of offences of theft from retail establishments contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct as charged spans several months during the period from August 2024 through to April 2025, principally occurring within the city of Leicester and its immediate environs.

Procedural Background  
Your arrest took place on 8 April 2025 following a detailed investigatory operation involving Leicester City Police’s Retail Crime Unit and the Leicester Business Crime Partnership. The operation was initiated subsequent to the accumulation of reports from multiple small and medium-sized retail premises, including independent grocers and chain pharmacies, which documented repeated instances of illicit appropriation of stock by an individual matching your description. It became apparent over time that these incidents formed part of a detectable pattern, characterised by methodical entry into stores and removal of goods over a protracted duration.  

The investigatory process reflected considerable exertion, with officers tasked to reconcile numerous witness statements, incident reports, and hours of surveillance footage often hampered by low resolution, poor lighting, and inconsistent camera angles. It should be emphasised that the utility of surveillance technology in retail theft cases is circumscribed by such technical limitations, which necessitate painstaking manual review to extract evidentially coherent material. The strategic collation of these fragments enabled law enforcement to ultimately converge on you as a suspect. 

A note must be made of the significant resource implications to the police of cases such as this: the diversion of officers and investigators to pursue investigatory leads, the involvement of digital forensic analysts in processing CCTV and electronic data, and the engagement of specialist retail liaison officers who coordinated the gathering of victim impact statements and catalogue stock loss. These demands are set against a backdrop of competing priorities, including investigations into more serious forms of harm such as violent assaults and organised criminal activity. The impact on stretched police capacity from recurrent low-level acquisitive crime is tangible and well-documented.

You were formally interviewed under caution on 10 April 2025, at which time you declined to make substantive admissions. Evidence later adduced in the form of matched footwear impressions and distinctive clothing items linked you conclusively to events captured on store cameras. Following charge on 15 April 2025, the case was transferred to this Crown Court under the Better Case Management scheme, with the aim of progressing it within applicable timetables prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Rules.

I should record that the progression of this matter has, regrettably, been subject to some administrative delay. Applications for Legal Aid funding in connection with the commissioning of an independent psychiatric assessment were protracted. It took multiple submissions and correspondence over the course of three months before approval was granted to instruct Dr Dominic Rowland, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose report was ultimately filed on 1 September 2025. Delays of this nature distress not only the defendant but also risk frustrating the prompt and fair administration of justice. The system’s efficiency is a matter of continuing concern and one which the judiciary regularly flags with funding authorities.

In noting those matters, I must also acknowledge the diligent efforts of those involved in victim support and retail safety. The Leicester Retailers Association has provided testimony describing the pervasive anxiety felt by staff as a consequence of persistent shoplifting incidents, including increased costs related to security enhancements and staff training on theft deterrence. These testimonies serve as a poignant reminder that offences of this kind, while often characterised as minor or victimless, carry real and cumulative human and economic cost.

It is also appropriate to reference the broader context in which acquisitive offending occurs. The current period is marked by heightened social pressures—rising cost of living, widespread housing instability, and a stretched public health infrastructure, particularly within mental health services. NHS waiting lists for adult psychological support have grown significantly, with many individuals languishing for months prior to assessment or treatment. The National Probation Service similarly faces notable staffing shortages, with turnover rates impacting capacity to offer effective supervision and rehabilitative intervention. These systemic strains, while noteworthy as background, do not license criminal behaviour but do inform the context within which offenders and victims alike find themselves.

A plea and case management hearing was convened on 30 September 2025. You entered a plea of guilty to the offences on that occasion. This plea, whilst welcome, was regrettably late in the course of proceedings, thereby limiting the degree to which the court can extend significant sentencing credit for prompt acceptance of responsibility. The jurisprudence in this area is clear: as adjudged in R v. Mayweather [2023] EWCA Crim 1248, credit for guilty plea is a discretionary matter, calibrated according to the timing and sincerity of the admission. Late pleas prompted primarily by evidential inevitability rather than demonstrable remorse attract only limited mitigation.

It is also unfortunate but commonplace that in matters of persistent acquisitive offending, initial denials are sustained until the weight of evidence becomes indisputable. This pattern, while recognised as fitting within the defendant’s procedural rights, inevitably imposes additional burdens on witnesses, court resources, and victims themselves. As underscored in R v. Farrow [2022] EWCA Crim 1803, such tactics impede the timely administration of justice and thus restrict the latitude for credit at sentence.

Notwithstanding the procedural progress, this case proceeded with customary care and adherence to court directives. Particular thanks are due to Miss Nadia Clarke, prosecuting counsel, and Mr Rohan Mehta, representing you under a Legal Aid certificate, both of whom have advanced thorough and measured submissions reflective of their professional responsibilities.

The offence charged is theft from multiple retail premises. You were charged with eight counts, consolidated into a single representative count for the purposes of efficiency and proportionality. The prosecution relies heavily on visual evidence recovered from security installations, corroborated by digital transaction logs and witness statements.

The relevant legal framework is set out in section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offence requires proof of dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive the owner thereof. The magistrates’ courts have jurisdiction over many isolated shoplifting cases, particularly those involving low monetary sums. However, in instances of sustained or repeated conduct, especially where the pattern exhibits planning or deliberate targeting of vulnerable establishments, Crown Court jurisdiction is appropriate and reflects the gravity attributed to such offending by Parliament.

The Sentencing Council’s guideline on Theft Offences (last updated 2023) reminds the court that aggravating factors include persistence, exploitation of vulnerable victims, use of distraction or deception techniques, and harm to the wider community through loss of trust or diminished retail viability. Mitigating features can encompass early guilty pleas, remorse, first-time offending, and demonstrable engagement with rehabilitation. 

The court may also derive guidance from applicable appellate authority. For instance, in R v. Coleman [2024] EWCA Crim 779, the Court reiterated that sentences for repeat shop theft offences must address both the individual culpability and the wider aim of deterrence, particularly where offending has caused measurable distress to staff or business proprietors. Such cases may attract immediate custody in the absence of compelling welfare or rehabilitation considerations.

R v. Sanchez [2022] EWCA Crim 553 considered the effect of personal circumstances such as homelessness or mental health needs on sentencing in acquisitive crime. While these factors do not negate responsibility, they require proportionate consideration within the assessment of culpability and risk.

Further precedent was provided by R v. Ahmad [2021] EWCA Crim 1641, where the court distinguished between isolated incidents and systemic offending reflective of ingrained criminality. Most notably, that judgment emphasised the need to balance public protection with the rehabilitative potential of community orders tailored to address underlying issues such as addiction or trauma.

I will now turn to a succinct summary of the facts as presented by the Crown and accepted by you in your guilty plea.

These actions were documented across multiple retail outlets, inclusive of local independent newsagents and a regional pharmacy chain. The offences occurred predominantly midweek, often in mid-morning periods when staffing coverage was limited.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

In several instances your conduct demonstrated specific knowledge of store layouts and surveillance blind spots, suggesting a degree of premeditation and familiarity with security arrangements beyond that expected of a casual passer-by.

The emotional and professional impact of your conduct on retail employees is noted in victim impact statements presented at the hearing. Employees reported elevated apprehension, decreased job satisfaction, and consequent alterations to work patterns intended to reduce interaction during your typical visiting hours.

Despite involvement with diversionary programmes following earlier incidents and repeated warnings from local policing teams, you resumed the prohibited conduct within three months.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

Turning to expert assessments, the psychiatric report authored by Dr Rowland concludes that whilst you do not suffer from a major psychiatric disorder, there is evidence of borderline personality traits manifesting as impulsivity and poor emotional regulation. These factors provide some context but do not excuse the pattern of offending. Moreover, the report highlights your limited engagement with community support services and persistent deficits in motivation to alter lifestyle circumstances.

The Probation Service has contributed a pre-sentence report which, while noting your expressed remorse and present accommodation within supported housing, identifies a moderate risk of recidivism consistent with a pattern of repetitive acquisitive offending. The report advocates for consideration of structured intervention, including cognitive behavioural programmes addressing criminal thinking and impulsivity.

This court notes with some frustration the ongoing crisis in public services designed to provide such interventions. Probation caseloads are at historic highs, and mental health services remain under strain. The challenging combination of county-wide resource limitations, growing caseloads, and budgetary constraints restrict the availability of bespoke rehabilitative initiatives. That said, the need to protect the public and reduce reoffending remains a paramount judicial concern.

The court recognises that you are presently 29 years old, with a previous record including three ancillary convictions for similar theft offences, and two caution referrals where community penalties were imposed. None of these earlier interventions succeeded in deterring you from continued offending. You report sporadic employment but no current income.

I must also note in passing that the co-defendant initially linked to some related offence on 29 March 2025 — specifically an attempted burglary involving forcible entry to a vacant address — remains at large, and the inquiry into those matters continues independently. I mention this not for its relevance to your case, but because such parallel proceedings involve the same precincts and investigative teams.

In assessing sentence, the court is reminded that rehabilitation is a key aim of sentencing, alongside punishment, deterrence, and protection of the public. The balance between custodial and community measures must be carefully struck, reflecting the gravity of the offence, the risk posed by the offender, and the feasibility of effective intervention.

Many defendants in similar circumstances benefit from provision of integrated support addressing financial instability, substance misuse, and mental health vulnerabilities. The court trusts that probation will endeavour to explore all such avenues in their forthcoming report.

It is of interest that during the course of these proceedings the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative processes have again come under scrutiny, owing to the delay in authorising funding for expert instruction. Rarely does a case proceed without such bureaucratic hurdles, which collectively slow justice and impose added strain on practitioners and litigants alike.

Moreover, the court is conscious of the toll on retail employers and employees who, during a time of economic uncertainty and inflationary pressure, face the double burden of financial loss and occupational stress provoked by persistent acquisitive offending. The psychological harm, though intangible, is consequential.

I conclude these remarks by reiterating the court’s commitment to imposing a sentence that reflects the seriousness of repeated theft from retail premises, suitably calibrated to your personal circumstances and risk profile. I direct that a pre-sentence report be obtained to guide the court’s final determination, including consideration of any rehabilitative requirements, possible community orders, and custodial thresholds.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, at Leicester Crown Court, Court 5. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is hereby informed of the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs remain reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
