IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/14568  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. Carmichael  
Filed: 8 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced in relation to a charge brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, concerning a course of conduct involving the theft of goods from multiple retail establishments across the Greater Manchester area over a period spanning from late 2023 through to early 2025. This charge is representative of a persistent pattern of offending which, while not involving violence, has had a cumulative detrimental impact on victims and the wider community.

Procedural Background  
Your case was initially remitted to this Crown Court following the grant of the Crown’s application on 12 February 2025 for indictment, the matter having been initially dealt with in the Magistrates’ Court at Stockport. The decision to escalate arose from the complex nature of the conduct alleged and the volume of evidence assembled by the Greater Manchester Police Business Crime Unit, in coordination with the Manchester Retail Crime Prevention Forum. The latter is a multi-agency partnership involving local businesses, police, social services, and community safety organisations, focusing on managing repeat offenders and sharing intelligence concerning retail theft and related antisocial behaviours.

The investigation culminating in your arrest and subsequent charge took considerable resources, featuring a series of covert surveillance operations, digital forensic examination of mobile devices, and detailed analysis of CCTV footage recovered from several high street and suburban store locations. These efforts were coordinated with the assistance of the Greater Manchester Digital Investigations Team, whose workload over recent years has sharply expanded in relation to acquisitive crimes. It is worth noting, for context, that the operational demands placed on such units now increasingly rival those associated with more traditional categories of criminality.

The court acknowledges, with appreciation, the diligence displayed by all investigative teams and partner agencies. The compilation of evidence was conducted over a protracted period and in the context of wider pressures on public services, including the Greater Manchester Combined Authority’s efforts to tackle retail crime through both enforcement and prevention. The Business Crime Partnership reports have highlighted that between 2019 and 2024 there has been a gradual but consistent increase in incidents of shoplifting and fraud targeting local independent retailers, which have suffered disproportionately in the post-pandemic period.

In the course of these proceedings, the defence applied for and was granted funding to instruct a forensic psychiatrist, reflecting concerns raised about your mental health and personal circumstances. Formal instructions were given to Dr Henrietta Bryson, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at the Northern Clinical Assessment Unit, whose report was admitted into evidence and discussed during the sentencing hearing. Dr Bryson’s report was both detailed and professionally composed, offering insight into your psychological profile, albeit ultimately concluding there was no identifiable major mental illness contributing causally to the offending behaviour.

The court also acknowledges receipt of written representations from the Manchester Small Business Support Network, a voluntary sector organisation that works closely with small retail businesses affected by crime and antisocial behaviour. Their correspondence emphasised the significant financial and psychological toll on proprietors and staff in the affected locations, noting specifically that the continued presence of repeat offenders in the community undermines confidence in local commerce and deters investment.

The Legal Aid Agency’s role in this case warrants mention — not just for procedural completeness but as a matter of record. The agency’s processing of the application for the defence’s funding to instruct an independent expert was subject to repeated delay and inconclusive correspondence. Initial requests submitted in March 2025 met with protracted postponements and requests for additional documentation, leading to a delay of over eight weeks before approval was granted. Such administrative inefficiency is regrettable and has tangible consequences on defendants' rights to timely justice, as well as on the efficient use of court time and resources. The issue, widespread as reports suggest, should be addressed as a matter of priority by the responsible authorities.

This court is also mindful of the strain on probation and rehabilitative services across the Greater Manchester area. Staffing shortages, increased caseloads, and funding challenges have resulted in extended waiting times for assessments and limited availability of intervention programmes tailored to acquisitive offending. Pre-sentence reports in such cases must therefore be carefully calibrated, recognising these systemic constraints while striving to offer meaningful pathways to rehabilitation.

Moreover, it would be remiss not to observe the broader social context within which these offences have taken place. The gradual rise in street homelessness and associated street-begging in the urban centres of Greater Manchester has been well-documented by local authorities and third-sector organisations. This phenomenon, symptomatic of complex socioeconomic pressures, interacts in multifarious ways with patterns of acquisitive crime. However, the court’s role is not sociological analysis; rather, it is to adjudicate individual conduct against the parameters of law and justice.

On a related note, there has been increasing concern among public safety bodies about the normalisation of certain antisocial behaviours in public and commercial spaces. A sense of public tolerance towards minor but persistent disorder may inadvertently contribute to the erosion of respectful communal coexistence. While not every act of minor infringements on social norms is prosecutable or deserving of sanction, the cumulative effect strengthens patterns of disregard for property and persons alike.

Turning to the criminal procedural aspects, this matter was duly listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing (PTPH) on 19 September 2025. You initially pleaded not guilty but later, at the outset of today’s hearing, entered a plea of guilty to the representative count. The timing of that plea is regrettably late. The court has considered the relevant authorities, including the recent judgment in R v. Nazir [2024] EWCA Crim 321, which emphasises that while credit for a guilty plea is an important aspect of sentencing, such credit is closely linked to the timing of the admission and the benefit to victims and the court system. Late pleas submitted only when conviction appears inevitable attract diminished discount.

Previous case law further reinforces the principle that while courts should encourage early acceptance of responsibility, this incentive does not extend indefinitely. For example, in R v. Calloway [2023] EWCA Crim 1056, the appellate court confirmed that a plea on the day of trial following exhaustive forensic and witness disclosure should attract a reduced credit in recognition of the delayed acceptance. While that case concerned aggravated burglary with violence — a materially different factual background — its guidance on plea timing is broadly relevant.

Legal context governing sentencing in theft cases is primarily derived from the Theft Act 1968 and elaborated in the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on theft and dishonesty offences, published in 2020 and updated in 2023. The guideline stresses the importance of considering culpability, harm, and the prospect of rehabilitation. It recognises that theft offences, while often low in monetary value, can cause disproportionate emotional and psychological impact on victims, particularly in cases involving repeated offending or vulnerable individuals.

Relevant aggravating and mitigating factors are enumerated within the guidelines. Importantly, the repeated targeting of independent retailers — as seen here — may itself constitute aggravation due to the relative vulnerability of such businesses and the cumulative community harm their loss sustains.

This aligns with the observations made in R v. Page [2022] EWCA Crim 1945, where the defendant was convicted of a series of low-value thefts from small shops in the North West. The court observed that the “impact upon the day-to-day life of victims and the viability of small businesses, which provide local employment and community hubs, must weigh heavily in sentencing considerations.” The Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 16 months’ imprisonment, noting the persistence and deliberate nature of the offending.

The court also notes that, although offences involving violence or controlled drugs often attract higher tariff sentences, the social harm related to property offences like theft is not to be underestimated. The findings in R v. Galloway [2021] EWCA Crim 1218, which addressed the proper approach to sentencing persistent acquisitive offenders, highlight that public confidence in the criminal justice system depends in part on credible responses to property crime.

In your case, there is evidence that, despite interventions, cautions, and community resolution initiatives, you continued the offending behaviour. The cumulative effect on the affected businesses, their staff, and the wider community framework justifies a firm stance.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

Regarding the victim impact, statements submitted by the managers of the affected establishments speak repeatedly of feelings of insecurity, anxiety, and demoralisation. One witness noted that scheduling changes and additional security measures were implemented to mitigate your presence. Others described the psychological toll as substantive, impacting staff welfare alongside financial loss.

Such evidence underscores the principle that harms from theft encompass both objective economic impairment and subjective emotional damage. Courts must balance these factors carefully in assessing sentence severity.

Additionally, correspondence from the Manchester Retail Staff Welfare Association has drawn attention to the challenges faced by shop workers exposed to repeated theft and the attendant fear of escalation into violence or intimidation. These concerns, while not directly material here, amplify the importance of judiciary responses calibrated to deter and rehabilitate.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

On the question of your personal circumstances, the psychiatric assessment by Dr Bryson was keen to emphasise your lack of major mental disorder but highlighted traits consistent with impulsivity, low self-control, and moderate dependency on prescribed substances — primarily benzodiazepines. The report notes your limited engagement with specialist addiction services despite repeated offers of support.

This pattern corresponds with observations in the probation report, which identify risk factors including unstable accommodation, minimal social support, and low motivation to partake in rehabilitative programming. Probation personnel expressed concern that delays in service delivery due to resourcing constraints have hindered timely interventions.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Additional personal background notes that you are currently 35 years old, with a modest employment record disrupted by periods of unemployment. You have four previous convictions related to theft offences, predominantly from the last three years, and have previously been subject to conditional cautions aimed at diversion.

As for family and social supports, it is evident your connections are sporadic and fragile, offering limited sustainable support. Letters of support submitted from community workers and a relative outline a history of instability but also express hope for positive change.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

In the course of preparation for this sentencing, the defence sought to introduce several documents elucidating your background, including a statement from your sister and letters from local charities providing intermittent assistance with housing and food access. These materials have been received and carefully considered, though they do not materially alter the court’s appreciation of your culpability or prospects.

The defendant’s personal letter to the court was, to be frank, painstakingly written and exhibited genuine effort. While a letter of this nature is no substitute for formal expressions of remorse in open court, it has been accorded some weight in mitigating.

By contrast, the Crown has rightly emphasised that the late timing of the plea necessitates a commensurate reduction in credit. The principle, as enunciated by the Court of Appeal and reflected in Sentencing Council Guidance, is that while a plea of guilty is to be encouraged and rewarded, it must be balanced against the costs of delayed acceptance.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

Concurring with this, there is no evidence that your guilty plea has relieved the necessity for witness statements, oral testimony, or considerable investigation and disclosure. The court is conscious that late pleas erode public confidence and impose avoidable strain on victims and witnesses.

In considering sentence, I have had regard to all statutory requirements, including the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offence, provide a credible deterrent, protect the public, and facilitate rehabilitation. The available sentencing options span from community orders — incorporating activity requirements and unpaid work — through suspended sentence orders to immediate custodial sentences.

Given the history of repeated offending, your failure to desist despite previous formal warnings, and the persistent harm caused to vulnerable local businesses, the court leans towards a custodial outcome unless reasonable grounds for community disposal emerge from further assessment.

Following today’s hearing, a comprehensive pre-sentence report shall be commissioned, with detailed consideration of your suitability for community-based interventions, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and financial management programmes. The report will also reassess the risk you pose to public safety and the likelihood of compliance.

Your counsel, Mr Douglas Whitcombe, has conducted proceedings professionally and thoroughly under the Legal Aid scheme. His submissions have been measured and informed, emphasising your personal difficulties and potential for rehabilitation given the right supports.

I record my gratitude to Ms Harriet Long, instructed on behalf of the Crown, whose advocacy was clear and respectful.

The court is also grateful to court staff who ensured the smooth conduct of today’s hearing, despite occasional delays to interpreter availability in earlier sessions of the day. The recently refurbished courtroom layout has been much improved, aiding accessibility and participant comfort.

The importance of ensuring clear and cogent communication is paramount in cases involving complex personal circumstances. Courts rely heavily on expert psychological and social reports to inform sentencing options.

This hearing has taken place in open court, with full attendance by prosecution and defence representatives. There is no application for reporting restrictions in place.
