IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/14736  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. S. Cartwright  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence on a charge arising from a series of offences of theft by shoplifting from various retail premises within Greater Manchester over a period spanning fifteen months. The offences form part of a course of conduct which the Crown prosecution contends was persistent and deliberate, targeting vulnerable and small-scale businesses across several neighbourhoods.

Procedural History  
You were initially arrested on 3 May 2025 following an intelligence-led investigation conducted by officers from the Greater Manchester Police Retail Crime Unit, acting in conjunction with the Manchester Business Crime Alliance. This multi-agency collaboration reflected ongoing concerns about rising incidents of theft in the city centre and adjoining suburban areas, where smaller convenience and pharmacy outlets had reported increasing rates of stock losses attributed to shop theft. Initial reports were sporadic, but the aggregation of CCTV footage, witness statements, and retail inventory discrepancies identified a pattern likely connected to a single individual.  

It is a regrettable truth, acknowledged by many in the law enforcement and retail sectors, that shoplifting offences such as these consume a disproportionate share of police time and public funds relative to their apparent monetary value. The demands of evidence-gathering, disclosure preparation, and witness management—especially in a case involving multiple premises and extended periods—are formidable. Such detailed investigations notwithstanding, the courts remain mindful that repeated offending of this nature undermines community confidence and harms vulnerable businesses.  
You were initially taken into custody but subsequently granted bail subject to strict conditions, including a curfew, regular reporting, and restrictions on your movements within the city centre and certain retail hubs. Bail compliance was carefully monitored, and any breeches documented. Following preliminary hearings, the matter was swiftly listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 24 June 2025, reflecting a proactive management approach by all parties. The Better Case Management regime was diligently applied, ensuring that disclosure and case progress adhered to statutory timetables. Such expedition is welcome, as it assists the administration of justice and respects the rights of the accused and the community alike.

This case was set down for sentence following your indication, made at the arraignment hearing on 24 August 2025, that you intended to enter a guilty plea. The timing of your admission, late in the process but before the trial window, is noted and will be taken into account in mitigation. However, the court is attentive to the jurisprudence concerning the assessment of plea credit in circumstances where early admissions would have been possible but were delayed for tactical reasons.

The court also recognises, with some gratitude, the detailed pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Fiona Somerset, probation officer, whose diligence and insight have been invaluable. Ms Somerset’s report offers a comprehensive analysis of your background, circumstances, and potential for rehabilitation. It also identifies risk factors pertinent to the court’s public protection duties.

I acknowledge the written submissions lodged on your behalf by Mr Oliver Penn, counsel instructed under a representation order. Mr Penn has advanced arguments articulating the mitigating effects of your personal circumstances, including your current housing situation, and the absence of any prior history of violence. I give due consideration to these representations in my overall assessment.

The court is not unmindful of the pressures currently borne by the Legal Aid Agency and associated administrative bodies. The reported delay in funding approval for the instruction of a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Helena Yates, who provided an expert neuropsychological assessment, regrettably extended the duration of proceedings. This is present not as criticism but as an observation of systemic constraints facing the justice system at this time. Such matters indirectly bear on the fairness and expedition of criminal trial processes and are noted with professional concern.

In accordance with well-established principle, the court must sentence you based on the facts proved, the seriousness of the offence, personal mitigation, and wider public interest considerations.  
The period between your arrest and the current hearing has allowed for the preparation of detailed victim impact statements, many of which express significant distress and highlight the broader economic and psychological consequences of repeat shoplifting for staff in small retail businesses. This court is mindful of the growing body of research demonstrating the cumulative toll of such offences on retail workers' well-being, including increased absenteeism, anxiety, and resignation from employment. These factors, though intangible, require sufficient weight in considering sentence.

Historical Case Law References  
It is instructive to recall that the Theft Act 1968, under section 1, defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner. The courts' approach to theft sentencing has evolved over decades, with particular emphasis on offender culpability, harm caused, and the impact on victims.

In R v. Harman [2019] EWCA Crim 892, the Court of Appeal highlighted the significance of repeated offending over prolonged periods, cautioning against assessments solely focused on the value of stolen items. Harman concerned multiple shoplifting offences from supermarkets amounting to a modest aggregate theft value, yet the offender's behaviour was held to demonstrate a wilful disregard for social order warranting an immediate custodial sentence.

Additionally, the guidance in R v. Bellamy [2020] EWCA Crim 737 addresses the appropriateness of custody for offenders exhibiting patterns of acquisitive crime unamenable to community sanctions. Although Bellamy involved burglary, the statements regarding deterrence and public protection are relevant by analogy to sustained shoplifting.

Moreover, the sentencing principles enunciated in R v. Tremblay [2023] EWCA Crim 1049 offer insight into the weighting of mitigating factors such as mental health, socio-economic disadvantage, and prospects for rehabilitation in theft cases. Tremblay involved a defendant with complex personal vulnerabilities who nonetheless engaged in organised shop theft; the court recognised the balancing act required between compassion and deterrence.

Cases involving clearly violent or aggravated offences inevitably invoke different considerations. For instance, R v. Ferris [2022] EWCA Crim 659, a conviction for affray arising from a pub altercation involving pool cues, is of limited direct relevance here, though it evidences the court's measured sensitivity toward context and harm. Similarly, environmental offences such as R v. Sutton [2018] EWCA Crim 301, which upheld custodial sentences for serious fly-tipping in protected woodland, illustrate how regulatory breaches may nevertheless be subject to proportional responses bearing no direct analogy to acquisitive crime.

The facts of this case are succinctly yet compellingly captured by the prosecution evidence: the CCTV records, store notes, and recovered property form a coherent narrative of sustained theft. This was not a sporadic lapse but rather a pattern exhibiting clear planning and repeated execution. The value of items stolen, while individually modest, built up over time and amounted to a significant aggregate loss. Store managers testified to the distress and operational disruption caused, including additional security measures and altered staff rotas.

In several incidents, you selected high-demand items such as over-the-counter medications and toiletries, which are commonly resold on secondary markets. This raises concerns not only about dishonest appropriation but the wider social implications of such offences — particularly in light of recent reports connecting petty theft with informal economies that may facilitate misuse or illegal resale.

The court is conscious that the pandemic context altered retail patterns and consumer behaviour. These shifts occasionally create perceptions of reduced oversight; however, the law remains constant in the expectance of respect for lawful property rights. It is neither an excuse nor a justification that premises may have been understaffed or operated with unusual procedures at times.

While no physical violence or threats were recorded, the evidence indicates that the impact on retail staff was non-trivial. Several employees reported heightened anxiety and a loss of confidence, with at least two taking leave due to stress linked to your offending. This psychological harm is a material element of the overall offence seriousness and must be reflected in sentencing considerations.

Dr Yates prepared a detailed psychiatric report following a court-ordered assessment arranged after your counsel applied for such expert evidence. Her findings concluded you display traits consistent with moderate impulsivity and features of mild substance dependence, though there is no diagnosis of severe mental illness. Dr Yates emphasised that your overall cognitive functioning remains intact, but that your social circumstances and transient housing history exacerbate stress and may contribute to recidivism if unaddressed. The report recommends engagement with structured support services, including substance abuse counselling and mental health monitoring, but notes a prior lack of sustained commitment to such resources.

Turning to your personal circumstances, the pre-sentence report by Ms Somerset offers a comprehensive picture. You are a 34-year-old man with a limited employment history, currently living in temporary accommodation arranged by a local housing authority. The report notes a history of unstable housing, interrupted education, and intermittent engagement with community support. There is no evidence of gang affiliation or coercion. Your previous convictions include three shoplifting offences, the last dating to 2019, for which you received a community order.

The report emphasises your avoidance of available support services, notwithstanding repeated opportunities. This intransigence is concerning insofar as it limits potential measures aimed at reducing the risk of reoffending. The court welcomes probation’s suggestion of involvement with rehabilitative programmes focused on crime-related thinking, alongside financial management and vocational advice.

It is notable that your letter to the court, tendered via counsel, was carefully composed and expressed a degree of remorse. While genuine contrition cannot be measured objectively, the court accepts the tone and content as indicative of awareness of wrongdoing and its impacts. Nevertheless, remorse is only one element among several in sentencing considerations.

Ms Somerset observed that some of your handwriting was neat and legible, reflecting a capacity for orderly reflection which may be harnessed in rehabilitation.

Throughout the many hearings associated with your case, court staff, ushers, and clerical officers have facilitated the process with professionalism and courtesy. The Crown Court at Manchester underwent refurbishment last year, and the layout now optimises magistrate and Crown Court integration while enhancing accessibility. It is worth recording institutional appreciation for these practical improvements that benefit all users of the justice system.

The Business Crime Alliance continues its important work in coordinating among police, businesses, and community organisations. In this case, their involvement secured timely victim impact statements and facilitated advisories to affected shops on loss prevention strategies. Their letter accompanying the submissions here highlights the positive intention to support your reintegration through community pathways, reflecting a commitment to restorative justice principles.

The court notes, however, that such initiatives face considerable staffing shortages and resource constraints, mirroring challenges encountered by the Greater Manchester Probation Service — which, like many public bodies, has been subjected to budgetary contraction and rising demand. These systemic pressures complicate the delivery of effective rehabilitation and supervision, contributing indirectly to reoffending risks.

It is also relevant to observe that the defendant’s brother is presently subject to unrelated criminal proceedings in a neighbouring jurisdiction, concerning an allegation of benefit fraud. That matter is separate and unconnected to the offences before this court and will not inform sentencing considerations here. The court’s focus remains squarely on your conduct and circumstances.

The court has considered recent data presented by Ms Catherine Reeve, a forensic analyst engaged by the police, summarising theft trends in the metropolitan area for the years 2020 to 2024. Her report underscores an overall increase in recorded retail theft, attributed in part to economic pressures and social dislocation. This statistical landscape contextualises but does not excuse individual criminality.

It is also worth noting that a previous prosecution in Manchester, R v. Clayton [2024] EWCA Crim 1568, concerned a defendant convicted of aggravated burglary and possession of blades within a school car park. That case was referenced in prosecutorial submissions by way of contrast: highlighting the differing gradations of harm and culpability within property crime. The Clayton case is not factually analogous but provides a legal backdrop reminding the court of broader community safety concerns linked to weapon possession unrelated to the present offences.

I am conscious that the victim in one of the premises involved here lives alongside a flatmate who made an unrelated police complaint the same week as your last offence. That extraneous detail neither aggravates nor mitigates your responsibility. It is mentioned solely for completeness.

The Crown has highlighted your failure to heed cautionary advice issued following community resolution interventions and prior warnings. Such repeated disregard bolsters the case for a custodial sentence or, at minimum, a robust community order incorporating stringent supervision and rehabilitative conditions.
