IN THE CROWN COURT AT WESTMINSTER  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. W2025/04127  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. K. Fairbank  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court pursuant to a charge involving the theft of goods from retail premises under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending comprises a series of discrete acts committed over an extended period of approximately two years, predominantly within the jurisdiction of Westminster and its adjoining boroughs. This court has carefully considered the material before it, including the trial bundle, pre-sentence reports, expert assessments, and the submissions of counsel.

Procedural History  
You were arrested on 17 May 2025 following a deliberate and coordinated operation led by officers from the Metropolitan Police Service's Acquisitive Crime Unit, assisted by the City Retail Crime Alliance, a partnership of retailers across London committed to combatting persistent shoplifting. Your arrest was the culmination of investigative work spanning some six weeks, involving the acquisition and analysis of multiple sources of evidence, including CCTV footage, electronic transaction records, and witness interviews. The sheer volume of evidence amassed underscores the complex and resource-intensive nature of such investigations even in offences frequently dismissed as minor.  
It is well documented that acquisitive crime, and shoplifting specifically, exerts a disproportionate burden on policing resources. The investigation draws officers away from other pressing operational needs, including serious violent crime, child exploitation, and public order management. The demands of retail crime prevention dovetail with those of local authority regulatory functions, housing enforcement, and social care teams, all of whom face diminishing capacity amidst budgetary constraints and increasing caseload complexity.

Following your arrest, you were interviewed under caution and denied involvement initially. However, the prosecution produced corroborative forensic and witness evidence which, at the conclusion of a first listing, prompted a guilty plea. Your case was then adjourned to enable appropriate assessments to be commissioned, including a psychiatric evaluation and a pre-sentence report. I note that Legal Aid grants for these reports were subject to protracted delays, a regrettably recurrent theme that this court has no authority to remediate but which nonetheless does much to compound uncertainty and frustration for all involved parties.

The Better Case Management (BCM) framework has governed the procedural timetable throughout. Under BCM, there has been adherence to indicative deadlines for plea hearings, disclosure, and trial preparation. It is an initiative intended to mitigate chronic delay and inefficiency which plague many Crown Court cases, especially those with multiple charges or involving vulnerable defendants. Both prosecution and defence counsel have displayed professional diligence in complying with court directions notwithstanding the underlying bureaucratic challenges.

Legal Context  
The law defines theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner thereof. The offences of which you stand convicted fall plainly within this definition. As a matter of principle, offences of theft from shops may be regarded as serious, even where individual items are of low monetary value. The impact on retail businesses, employees, and the wider community must be weighed accordingly.

I refer to the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline for theft offences, which recommends that sentencing reflects not only the financial loss, but also the harm occasioned by the breach of trust involved in retail theft, the defendant’s culpability, and any consequential emotional distress caused to victims and staff. Aggravating features, including persistence, planning, and repeat offending, inevitably attract greater severity. Conversely, mitigating elements such as early pleas, genuine remorse, and demonstrable steps towards rehabilitation may justify leniency.

For comparative purposes, I consider the rulings in R v. Pembroke [2019] EWCA Crim 2151, where the Court of Appeal upheld an 18-month custodial term for a defendant engaged in repeated thefts from a supermarket chain, citing the undermining of staff confidence and the broader deterrent objective. Although the factual matrix here varies, the principle that a course of conduct may justify custody remains authoritative.

Further, in R v. Atherton [2020] EWCA Crim 321, the court held that prolonged offending patterns erode community safety and public confidence in law enforcement’s effectiveness. These considerations resonate in the present case, where your repeated conduct has contributed materially to a climate of insecurity within the retail sector.

In addition, cases such as R v. Dawes [2018] EWCA Crim 1342 remind us of the necessity to balance sentencing objectives against the individual circumstances of the offender, particularly pertinent where vulnerability or mental health difficulties are implicated.

This court is alerted to no precedents of direct contemporaneous relevance involving co-defendants or partners in this matter, though I note for completeness that cases involving complicity or organised group offending in acquisitive crime typically attract enhanced sentences.

It is pertinent to observe that the better management of retail crime cases remains an elusive goal nationally. National organisations such as the Retail Crime Forum and industry stakeholders advocate for increased statutory powers and enhanced sentencing frameworks to more effectively deter serial offenders. Efforts to codify and refine risk assessment protocols also remain in evolution, a testament to the complexity of balancing punitive and rehabilitative aspirations.

In the course of reviewing the material, the court received reports from the Retail Support and Recovery Network, a volunteer-led charity supporting staff subjected to repeated theft-related strain. Their submission highlighted the frequently invisible emotional toll inflicted by persistent shoplifting — a phenomenon borne out by victim impact statements submitted with the primary prosecution evidence.

Similarly, correspondence from the Westbourne Family Centre provided contextual data relating to your assistance with family matters, though these have no direct bearing on the offense conduct.

Notably, the legal aid system’s operational challenges have introduced procedural latency without benefit. The delayed funding approval for psychiatric assessment hindered the timely progression of sentencing, reflecting a broader systemic issue.

On occasion, administrative bottlenecks—often not attributable to individuals but systemic underfunding—threaten the very principle of timely justice, a concern respected by this court.

The Facts of the Offence  
The facts of the case are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

The modus operandi involved targeted selection of high-demand items such as toiletries, confectionery, and low-denomination electronics accessories, frequently timed to coincide with staff shift changes or when managerial presence was minimal.

Observations by security personnel confirm a pattern of behaviour indicating a degree of premeditation extending beyond spontaneous opportunistic theft. Indeed, there was noted employment of diversion tactics and purposeful concealment strategies.

Psychiatric and Probation Assessments  
A psychiatric assessment conducted by Dr Miriam Lazenby, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at the Western London Forensic Unit, concluded that while you exhibit no major mental disorder, features of low mood, anxiety, and impulsivity were evident. Dr Lazenby’s report, dated 10 September 2025, references historical trauma exposure and intermittent engagement with mental health services. The suggestions offered advocate for low-intensity psychological interventions targeting underlying stress and decision-making – notably a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy framework. However, the report notes that your engagement with such services has been inconsistent at best.

Parallel to this, the probation service provided a comprehensive pre-sentence report highlighting your current accommodation status, lack of steady employment, and absence of meaningful support networks. The report stresses medium likelihood of rehabilitation given your prior convictions and ambivalence towards assistance. Moreover, it details the strain on probation resources occasioned by widespread caseload growth and attrition of experienced officers.

You are aged 35. Your previous convictions include multiple theft offences, none involving violence or serious harm. There are no identifiable factors indicating gang involvement or exploitation. Engagement with local community resources has been sparse, despite offers extended through liaison programmes.

A focus of the probation assessment concerns your sporadic compliance with prior conditional discharges and community sentences, revealing a pattern of superficial cooperation with limited sustained behavioural change.

Throughout your history, you have at times alluded to financial pressures and unstable housing, but have not availed yourself consistently of support conduits. This is regrettable in light of the numerous services aimed at mitigating hardship—be they food banks, employment schemes, or housing advice clinics—that operate under conditions of chronic underfunding and over-demand.

Reflection on Contemporary Public Service Challenges  
The court is cognizant of mounting pressures on agencies tasked with managing the intersecting needs of offenders such as yourself. Probation services nationwide report unprecedented caseloads compounded by funding shortfalls and workforce vacancies. Mental health provision remains constrained by long waiting lists and fragmented community offerings.

Retail sectors likewise grapple with resource deficiencies in security staffing and technological deterrents, increasingly dependent upon voluntary partnerships and external funding to bridge systemic gaps.

It is amid this tangled fabric that cases like yours unfold—neither fully tragic nor wholly banal, but emblematic of the complex interface between individual choice and structural limitation.

Indeed, the court notes with respectful appreciation the efforts of multi-agency collaborations which, while often strained, nevertheless endeavour to address the multiplicity of factors associated with acquisitive offending.

I observe furthermore that the proliferation of smartphone-enabled social media, influencer culture, and instantaneous digital communication has altered the landscape of public engagement with justice issues. These channels often trivialise or misrepresent matters of crime and punishment, exacerbating public skepticism and undermining trust in institutions.

This is not irrelevant. Perceptions shape social norms, impact victim willingness to report, and influence offender attitudes.

Further Case Law Context  
Among the many appellate authorities dealing with guilty pleas and sentence credit, R v. Johnson [2023] EWCA Crim 1786 is instructive. The Court of Appeal reaffirmed that credit for a guilty plea should be tempered by the timing of the plea relative to the evidentiary case, the saving of public resources, and the degree of offender remorse.

Also relevant is R v. Harper [2021] EWCA Crim 987, concerning persistent petty theft from charity shops. The Court distinguished between one-off lapses and sustained offending, underscoring the need for sentences tailored neither to excessive leniency nor disproportionate harshness.

Other ancillary matters of note include R v. Oldfield [2019] EWCA Crim 2454 dealing with community sentences for acquisitive crime. The decision emphasised the importance of rehabilitative programming tailored to cognitive deficits and raised concerns about rigid custodial imposition absent proper service provision.

It is pertinent to record that no charges or convictions related to violent conduct, firearms, drugs supply, or sexual offences attach to you or your immediate family.

The case law dealing with custodial thresholds continues to evolve. This court, mindful of such developments, must ground decisions firmly in both legal precedent and the specific circumstances before it.

Victim Impact and Community Considerations  
Statements from retail staff who encountered your conduct reveal a variegated but substantive emotional impact including feelings of vulnerability, fear, and workplace anxiety. One clerk reported a noticeable downturn in morale following repeated offences, while another expressed concern about the erosion of workplace safety culture.

Commercially, losses are absorbed unevenly but cumulatively contribute to elevated prices and reduced service hours. These are real harms affecting the broader community of consumers and workers alike.

I acknowledge that the defendants’ family members have made written representations pursuant to the rules of court. These letters, while reflecting genuine affection and concern, do not detract from the seriousness of the case.

Glossary of Procedural and Institutional References  
This court, established in the early 19th century following legislative reforms to centralise criminal adjudication within Westminster, continues to sit with dignity and decorum.

The courtroom, recently refurbished to enhance accessibility and technological capacity, provides an appropriate forum for the administration of justice.

Court ushers, clerks, and administrative staff have ensured the smooth running of these proceedings despite occasional disruptions such as late arrival of interpreters and technical difficulties with remote witness testimony.

It is part of the judicial tradition that the court offers formal thanks to counsel engaged in these prosecutions and defences. Ms Serena Wilkes, who appears on behalf of the Crown, has presented a measured and thorough case. Mr Andrew Forsyth, for the defence, has made thoughtful submissions advocating for a tailored sentencing approach.

Summary of Sentencing Considerations and Way Forward  
In light of the evidence, expert assessments, and known personal circumstances, the court concludes that the offending exhibits a degree of planning and persistence tending towards the serious end of the spectrum for retail theft. The cumulative impact on victims, business operations, and public confidence is appreciable.

Any mitigating factors rest principally on your guilty plea, though entered after some delay, and your expressed willingness to engage with community-based support. Nonetheless, your record of non-compliance tempers optimism regarding immediate rehabilitation prospects.

This court recognises that prison sentences must be proportionate and will only be imposed where no lesser sanction is appropriate to the nature and severity of the offending, and the public interest in deterrence and protection. Equally, there is a pressing societal demand to provide meaningful opportunities for desistance through engagement with therapeutic and rehabilitative programmes.

In this case, I shall direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the National Probation Service, with particular reference to your suitability for community rehabilitation interventions, as well as any mental health treatment options that may further public protection and reduce reoffending risk.

The report should also address particulate concerns including housing stability, financial management, and social support structures.

The preparation of this report should be expedited, mindful of the importance of releasing the court’s decision in a timely manner.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at Westminster Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentencing will be lodged with the appropriate authorities.
