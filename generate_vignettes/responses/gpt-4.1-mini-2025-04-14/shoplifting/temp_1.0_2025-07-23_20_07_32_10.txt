IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/16329  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge G. R. SANDLE  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically in relation to a series of shoplifting offences committed across various retail outlets within the Manchester metropolitan area between November 2023 and April 2025. This prosecution arises from carefully considered police inquiries prompted by reports from retailers and surveillance evidence assembled by the Greater Manchester Retail Crime Taskforce.  

Procedural background to this matter is, if not exceptional, then certainly of note. The case originally came before the magistrates’ court on 12 April 2025 and was committed here due to the gravity and multiplicity of the alleged offences, and because the Crown evidently sought a custodial outcome. The case progression has been characterised by routine administrative activity, including a plea and trial preparation hearing on 25 June 2025, when you pleaded not guilty. The trial was listed on 14 August 2025, but following further disclosure and an application by your legal representatives, a Newton hearing was avoided by your eventual admission on 10 September 2025. The court notes that such judicial economy is beneficial.  

It must nonetheless be observed, with a measure of judicial weariness, that the initial denial prolonged the proceedings and imposed significant additional burdens on victims, witnesses, and disclosure officers alike. While the legal system remains committed to ensuring that defendants receive a fair hearing, it is regrettable when peripheral or strategic considerations serve to delay final resolution in cases that might otherwise be straightforward. The late admission of guilt, whilst recognised, attracts a reduced degree of credit.  

The court wishes to place on record its appreciation for the Crown’s counsel, Ms Sarah Emmanuel, whose clearly articulated submissions have assisted the court in applying the relevant sentencing principles. Likewise, Mr Daniel Brooks, representing you under a Legal Aid order, has dutifully advanced the defence case, notwithstanding the considerable challenges occasioned by late forensic reports and delay in securing expert commission. It is, in this connection, necessary to record a certain frustration with the Legal Aid Agency. The protracted delay in authorising funding for a forensic psychologist’s report—initially requested on 29 May 2025 but not approved until 22 July 2025—served only to compound listing pressures and impede timely case management. Such bureaucratic inertia has attracted the censure of this and other courts on numerous occasions and remains a systemic concern.  

The phenomenon of persistent low-level offending continues to exert strain on policing and judicial resources, as well as, crucially, on the retail sector’s workforce. The Manchester Business Crime Reduction Partnership submitted a detailed chronology and impact statement dated 3 September 2025 outlining the economic consequences of theft, security adaptations deployed in response, and the psychological toll on shop staff who have experienced repeated exposure to your conduct. The persistence and predictability of this pattern bring into relief the importance of appropriate sentencing calibrated not only to individual culpability but to the broader public interest.  

It is germane also to comment on the difficulties faced by the Probation Service. The current operational environment is marked by staffing shortages, escalating caseloads, and an increasingly complex mix of offenders presenting with multifaceted health and social needs. These systemic pressures inevitably affect the range and availability of community interventions and the capacity for robust supervisory mechanisms. The Probation Service’s report, which I patiently await, will therefore be keenly scrutinised not only for its assessment of your personal circumstances but with a view to practical considerations of risk management and rehabilitative potential.  

The court is further mindful of the overall social context. Widespread reports indicate a troubling increase in street homelessness within Manchester city centre, with visible encampments and begging now frequent features of public space. This phenomenon has been linked with heightened antisocial behaviour, underlying substance misuse, and complex health needs. Whatever the broader socio-political catalysts for these developments, their manifestation in everyday urban life contributes to an atmosphere of diminished public order and security. An awareness of that environment is necessarily part of the sentencing matrix, although it cannot and must not excuse offending conduct.  

In preparation for this sentencing, the court has reviewed a comprehensive psychiatric assessment provided by Dr Olivia McPherson, consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 9 September 2025. Dr McPherson reports that you exhibit features consistent with episodic depressive disorder and impulsive behaviour but do not meet diagnostic criteria for a major mental illness. The neuropsychological screening indicated mildly impaired executive functioning, symptomatic of a possible frontal lobe deficit, which may bear upon your capacity for impulse control and long-term planning. At the same time, Dr McPherson is clear that such cognitive limitations do not absolve you from responsibility, although they may inform the nature of therapeutic intervention.  

Dr McPherson is cautiously optimistic that engagement with a structured cognitive-behavioural programme may yield some benefit, especially in addressing the impulsive traits identified. Nonetheless, the report emphasises the importance of robust supervision and clear consequences to underpin rehabilitation. It also soundly advises against custodial sentences without appropriate adjunct care, given the risk of rapid deterioration in mental wellbeing during detention.  

The principles underpinning sentencing in cases of theft are well established. The Theft Act 1968 remains the primary legislative source, with the Sentencing Council’s Theft Guideline 2022 giving detailed direction on application of culpability and harm categories, as well as appropriate ranges of sentence. The court is particularly mindful of the aggravating factors of persistence, targeting of vulnerable or independent retailers, impact on victims, and any evidence of premeditation.  

The appellate jurisprudence provides further clarity. In R v. Mellor [2023] EWCA Crim 417, the Court of Appeal underscored that repeated acquisitive offending evidences greater culpability and justifies enhanced custodial thresholds, particularly where defences have been unsatisfactory. Similarly, R v. Turton [2022] EWCA Crim 610 emphasises the need to balance rehabilitative aims with public protection when defendants exhibit impulsivity coupled with entrenched behavioural patterns. Neither Mellor nor Turton concern shoplifting specifically but are instructive on the approach to courses of offending marked by persistence and disregard for prior admonitions.  

I also draw attention to R v. Finnerty [2021] EWCA Crim 2081, where the Court considered an aggravated burglary with personal injury, emphasizing the impact on victims’ sense of safety. While the current case is distinct in nature—as theft rather than violent crime—the principle that the emotional and psychological consequences of offending should be fully recognized remains relevant.  

Furthermore, the court notes the decision in R v. Chan [2020] EWCA Crim 1187, a conviction for criminal damage involving racial aggravation. While there is no such aggravation present here, this case serves as a useful legal touchstone for understanding the gradation of seriousness where offences carry wider societal implications or involve public spaces.  

It is instructive to recall also R v. Price [2019] EWCA Crim 1435, where the Court upheld a sentence relating to possession of an unlicensed firearm at a public event, underscoring that public safety concerns may, in some cases, intensify the sentencing mark. Here, although the current offence does not bear comparison in gravity, the principle that potential systemic impact informs sentence choice is a thread that runs through criminal jurisprudence.  

In considering the trajectory of your conduct, I note your personal history. The probation officer’s report of 12 September 2025 candidly acknowledges your upbringing in a challenging environment, including periods of familial instability and interrupted education. You have attracted limited but notable early indications of antisocial behaviour in adolescence, which were the subject of social work interventions.  

A charity specialising in support for marginalised individuals, HopePath, has provided a letter of support dated 2 September 2025. Their outreach workers report on your sporadic engagement with voluntary measures aimed at alleviating housing instability and financial hardship. Despite these efforts, your pattern of non-engagement reflects a tenuous link with the services designed to support desistance.  

It is worth observing that the National Health Service’s Mental Health Trust in Greater Manchester has been under sustained pressure, with waiting times for community mental health team referrals averaging fourteen weeks. This delays access to specialist input and complicates the management of offenders with psychological vulnerabilities. These systemic issues, while background to proceedings, cannot excuse individual recalcitrance in pursuing offered assistance.  

I also pause to acknowledge the work of local voluntary organisations such as the Manchester Retailers’ Support Network, which has assisted multiple victims in navigating post-offence distress. Those organisations function with limited capacity and funding, often relying on volunteer labour and community goodwill. Their input into victim impact statements has provided valuable perspective on the lived experience of those affected by repeated shop theft. That this effort continues despite resource constraints merits commendation.  

This court is aware of the growing burden imposed by acquisitive crime on urban policing. The Greater Manchester Police Crime Directorate has, over the last two years, reallocated resources toward intelligence-led responses targeting prolific offenders, but the patchwork of causes—encompassing addiction, homelessness, and economic deprivation—strains such efforts. Persistent offenders contribute disproportionately to workload, leading to inevitable trade-offs between addressing low-level acquisitive offending and tackling more serious violence or organised crime.  

Admittedly, the courts themselves have seen an influx of such cases, with statistics for the calendar year 2024 indicating a 7.5% rise in shoplifting convictions compared to the previous year. The figures, collated independently by the Manchester Criminal Justice Board, show a troubling trend that brings into sharp focus the need for
