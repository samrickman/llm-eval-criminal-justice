IN THE CROWN COURT AT WINTERDALE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. WD/CRIM/2025/11543  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. P. Stratton  
Filed: 18 August 2025  

Mr H, you stand before the court to be sentenced in respect of charges concerning the unlawful appropriation of property from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences to which you have pleaded guilty span a period from early 2023 through to the spring of 2025 and were committed within the jurisdictional area of Winterdale and its adjacent commercial zones.   

Procedural History  
Your arrest occurred on 12 April 2025, following an investigation coordinated by the Winterdale Police Business Crime Unit in cooperation with the Winterdale Retailers’ Collaborative. The matter attracted considerable attention due to its duration, the pattern of your offending, and the manner in which it appears to have affected local retail establishments—ranging from small convenience stores to medical supply outlets in residential neighbourhoods. Notably, this multi-agency inquiry was facilitated by real-time intelligence sharing, employing a combination of CCTV footage review, electronic point-of-sale data, and asset loss registers.  

Adjudication of such matters within the Crown Court reflects the seriousness with which repeat acquisitive offending is regarded by the judiciary. While isolated shoplifting episodes are often dealt with summarily in magistrates’ courts, patterns of sustained dishonesty and the disruption they cause justify prosecutions at this level, both as a matter of deterrence and public confidence. The case was allocated to this court pursuant to Better Case Management (BCM) protocols, intended to focus judicial and legal resources efficiently. Your initial appearance took place on 29 April 2025, when legal representation was confirmed via a legal aid certificate granted after some procedural delay. The defence applied for further time to consider the full evidential files and requested psychiatric assessment, resulting in an adjournment to today’s sentencing hearing.  

It is worth taking note of the persistent frustrations encountered in securing timely legal aid authorisations for expert reports—a matter of growing concern for courtroom efficiency nationwide. The Legal Aid Agency’s internal delays in response to funding requests for a clinical assessment in this case, spanning over six weeks, continue a regrettable trend of administrative inertia that impinges disproportionately on defendants’ procedural rights and hampers effective case preparation.  

I must acknowledge, nonetheless, the professional diligence exhibited by both prosecution and defence counsel throughout. Ms Eleanor Bryce for the Crown and Mr Shaun Coventry for the defence have navigated the complexities of this case with commendable thoroughness and fairness.  

This hearing has been conducted openly in the Main Courtroom of Winterdale Crown Court, a facility which underwent refurbishment earlier this year with refreshingly modern design features aimed at improving access and amenity for all users, including vulnerable witnesses, defendants, and members of the public.

In a broader context, the court continues to experience the sustained burden that acquisitive crimes impose on the constabulary and allied enforcement agencies, notably the Winterdale Retail Crime Partnership and the Safer Neighbourhood Team. Staffing shortages — due in part to wider national recruitment challenges — have led to prioritisation dilemmas, with some crime types necessarily receiving less immediate attention. It is unfortunate that crimes of this nature, often deemed “low risk” in the hierarchy of threats, exact hidden costs, including reduced shop worker morale and increased security expenditure by small businesses already struggling in an unstable economic climate.  

It is well known to this court that shoplifting offences, while sometimes minimised by public discourse, have tangible ripple effects. For example, the Local Business Alliance confirmed in a recent briefing paper that over 60 per cent of independent retailers in the region have reduced evening opening hours citing theft-related losses and staffing difficulties.  

Your case was adjourned from the initial listing to facilitate receipt of psychiatric evaluation requested by the defence, resulting in a joint report prepared by Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist Dr Mohammed Ajmal Khan and Clinical Psychologist Ms Annie Fenton. I shall refer to this shortly.

To repeat, the framework within which this court operates is firmly anchored in the Theft Act 1968 and associated sentencing guidelines. The Theft Act’s definition, stating that deception, dishonesty, and intention to permanently deprive are critical elements, provides the legal bedrock from which such cases proceed.

I note also that the Crown Prosecution Service Guidelines on Charging advocate caution when pursuing repeat offenders, stressing proportionality and the public interest considerations.  

The legal framing aside, attention to this court’s case management trajectory illustrates some instructive procedural realities. The case has been listed on three separate occasions since April, punctuated by adjournments to accommodate reports and defence requests. Of note, administrative delays within the police disclosure team meant that certain materials were supplied behind schedule, necessitating extensions and rescheduling. Such occurrences, sadly, are emblematic of wider systemic pressures on forensic and disclosure units nationwide, where heavy workloads and limited staffing complicate timely evidence handling.  

It is an unfortunate reality that a number of cases involving low-level crime achieve public prominence only after exhausting considerable judicial, enforcement, and prosecutorial resource. This enmeshes the accused, victims, and the wider community in protracted processes, which might otherwise have been shorter if earlier intervention measures bore fruit.  

I am grateful to the staff of Winterdale Retail Support Network, whose outreach to affected small businesses has been unflagging throughout. Their submissions have, whilst circumspect, provided valuable insights into the contextual impact of your offending pattern on customer footfall, staff anxiety, and loss mitigation strategies.

Several victim impact statements have been tendered, including detailed commentary from Ms Gina Lambert, Store Manager of the Greenfields Pharmacy, who describes periodic disruptions and losses attributable to repeated theft. Efforts to reorganise staff shifts and implement tighter security protocols, including the hiring of additional security personnel at significant cost, have followed your offences.

Ms Lambert’s perspective echoes findings from national studies on retail theft impact, which record that emotional harm to staff—fear, mistrust, and fatigue—can eclipse the pure financial loss experienced by business owners.

The following paragraphs include the facts of the offending.

The nature of the incidents, recorded via CCTV and corroborated by witness statements, reveals a strategy attentive to timing and concealment. For example, your frequent selection of busy aisles and periods of staff distraction suggests a degree of deliberation beyond mere opportunism.  

Your persistence in targeting specific high-demand goods, including over-the-counter medicines and hygiene products, compounds the seriousness of these offences.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Your modus operandi also demonstrated adaptive behaviour — notably the deliberate concealment of items beneath clothing and the use of non-transparent carrying bags to facilitate removal from premises without payment.  

Indeed, the Winterdale Business Crime Unit interrogated your movements via enhanced CCTV analysis, ascertaining repeat visits to particular shops and the reuse of the same distinctive outerwear on multiple separate occasions.

Follow-up enquiries revealed that materials with security tags were sometimes rendered ineffective by removal or interference, indicating knowledge and planning.

Some store employees have reported sustained anxiety about potential confrontations and have, as a consequence, altered their working hours or sought transfers.  

Additionally, an independent expert commissioned by the court to assess emotional harm to retail staff offered evidence on ‘occupational distress syndrome,’ acknowledging the cumulative impact of repeated low-level crime on vulnerable workers. This ailment, while non-medical, substantially affects employee retention and wellbeing.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

It is regrettable to note that, despite prior interventions including community resolutions, you resumed such conduct after brief periods of compliance. The court is aware of your non-engagement with voluntary support programmes offered by local authorities and charities.  

Your repeated reoffending has necessitated a prosecutorial response beyond diversion or conditional cautions.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

In addition, the Crown highlights the fact that during the investigatory phase, you made conflicting statements about your accommodation status and source of income, noting inconsistency with regard to support by family or friends.

Expert and Risk Assessments  
Turning now to the joint psychiatric and psychological report prepared by Dr Khan and Ms Fenton, I note with interest their conclusions. The assessment found no diagnosable major mental illness that would impair your criminal responsibility. Instead, traits were noted of impulsivity, occasional substance misuse—relevant here is the reported intermittent use of cannabis—and pervasive feelings of social isolation and low self-esteem.  

The clinical team emphasised that while these factors may have contributed to your conduct, they do not excuse it. The view as expressed was that you would benefit from structured cognitive behavioural therapy focused on impulse control and skills development, ideally integrated with substance misuse counselling.  

The report also observed your limited engagement with existing social support networks and described significant barriers in accessing stable housing and employment.  

I am mindful of the probation service’s submission that their capacity to provide intensive intervention is presently stretched, with waiting lists lengthening for psychological services statewide, reflecting a national shortage of qualified clinical staff.  

The court is not unsympathetic to the challenges posed by social disadvantage, but equally must acknowledge the need for accountability. The fact that voluntary community services—ranging from food banks to youth outreach programmes—have made multiple overtures, some of which you have declined or failed to sustain, is a material consideration.  

In this regard, one recalls the oft-cited refrain that the mere availability of support is not synonymous with its uptake—an important distinction in both clinical and legal assessments.  

Mr H, you are now 38 years old with multiple prior convictions for similar offences, including a conditional discharge imposed in late 2021 following a separate episode involving theft of convenience goods. Your previous criminal record comprises five offences of acquisitive theft, none involving violence or threats. There is no evidence before this court of association with organised crime or coercion.

I note the defence’s contention that your offending relates primarily to financial hardship and difficulties securing stable accommodation. While the court accepts the reality of these circumstances, it maintains that they cannot justify unlawful conduct which causes real harm to individuals and communities alike.  

Social care agencies have submitted observations confirming your engagement with housing support teams is intermittent and inconsistent, and that there is a risk of homelessness should your circumstances deteriorate further. Such instability undoubtedly poses a risk factor for reoffending, which must be addressed systematically.  

It is a matter worthy of reflection—and concern—that many defendants with similar profiles face multiple, intersecting vulnerabilities, including poverty, mental health challenges, and fractured social relations. The criminal justice system can respond only piecemeal to these broader social problems, which properly fall within the remit of public health and social welfare policy.  

The broader societal context in which shoplifting occurs is, plainly, not neutral. The evidence from multiple jurisdictions demonstrates rising rates of street homelessness, increasing reliance on benefit payments marked by complexity and delay, and the persistence of childhood trauma and abuse among adult defendants in acquisitive crime.  

Stacked against limited state budgets, enduring austerity measures, and the ongoing effects of global recession, service provision for the most vulnerable remains patchy and inadequate.

Returning to the legal sphere, I place reliance on well-established appellate authority in matters of sentencing for theft offences. It is a useful reminder that the court’s primary aims include punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation, balanced alongside the interests of the victim and wider public protection.  

Consider, for example, R v. Dobson [2022] EWCA Crim 1785, which reaffirmed that while theft is often regarded as a matter of property alone, the chronic impact on retail workers and small business owners demands sentencing responses commensurate with cumulative harm.

Furthermore, in R v. Corbett [2024] EWCA Crim 1592, the Court of Appeal stressed that persistent shoplifting in community settings should attract custodial sentences where prior warnings and alternatives have failed.  

I also note the analytical framework set out in the Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences—which prioritises not only the monetary value but also the culpability, harm caused, and any aggravating or mitigating features.  

Aggravating factors include the breach of trust inherent in repeated access to the same premises, any use or threat of violence (which is absent here), and the effect on vulnerable victims. Mitigating factors may encompass genuine remorse, personal difficulties, and first-time offending, none of which apply fully in this instance.  

Turning again to credit for your guilty plea, this was entered at an advanced stage of proceedings, following substantial evidential accrual and comprehensive disclosure.  

As held in R v. Gregory [2023] EWCA Crim 322, the timing of a plea influences sentencing credit, with last-minute admissions reflecting tactical legal considerations rather than true remorse.

The court therefore must moderate the extent of any reduction accordingly.  

It is salient to acknowledge the impact of these crimes upon the victims. The staff who endured repeated encounters with you reported increased anxiety and fear. The victim impact statement provided by Ms Lambert, noted earlier, reflects this with palpable distress.  

This court is also cognisant of the fact that liability for damage or loss has been partly met through compensation orders proposed by the prosecution.  

Having heard submissions from counsel, including representations on your behalf by Mr Coventry, who emphasised your personal difficulties and pleaded for consideration of community-based penalties, I am constrained to say that only a cautious approach can be taken.  

The evidence and your track record suggest a persistent disregard for both law and the wellbeing of others, demonstrating increased culpability.  

Nevertheless, the prospect of custody is not pursued lightly. The court acknowledges the potential for rehabilitative intervention within the community. The question rests on balancing public protection and the likelihood of compliance.  

It is, however, evident that without substantive change there is a real risk of reoffending. Measures such as unpaid work requirements, curfews, or probation supervision may not suffice absent committed engagement with support services.  

This court therefore directs the preparation of a pre-sentence report, instructing the probation service to undertake a thorough risk and needs assessment, including consideration of cognitive skills programmes, substance misuse treatment, and housing stability support.  

I further request evaluation of restorative justice options, which may have utility in addressing harm perception and victim-offender dialogue where appropriate and consented to by all parties.  

No final sentence is announced today.
