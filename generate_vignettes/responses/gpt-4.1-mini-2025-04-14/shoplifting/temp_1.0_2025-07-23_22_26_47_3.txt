IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/15397  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. COLLINGWOOD  
Filed: 17 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence upon your conviction for offences of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically relating to a series of shoplifting incidents spanning a period from mid-2023 to late spring 2025. The offences occurred primarily within retail premises across the Brighton and Hove area, including multiple independent pharmacies and convenience stores. The Crown proceeded on a representative count reflecting your course of conduct.

Procedural Background  
Your case has followed a somewhat protracted procedural route, reflecting the challenges commonly encountered in prosecuting serial acquisitive offending. You were initially charged on 14 July 2025 following an investigation co-ordinated by the Brighton Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP), in response to an identified pattern of thefts characterized by methodical selection of small, high-demand items with resale value.  

This court acknowledges the invaluable role played by the BCRP, a partnership body comprising representatives of local retailers, the police, council licensing teams, and community safety officers. Their efforts in collating disparate incident reports, collating CCTV footage, and generating offender profiles remain vital in the face of rising levels of retail shrinkage nationally. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that without such multi-agency collaboration, many offenders would evade detection or, at minimum, face less certain prosecution.  

Nonetheless, it bears noting that while such partnerships ostensibly exemplify inter-agency efficiency, the reality can be one of considerable bureaucratic inertia. The administrative weight of compiling joint reports, coordinating witness statements, and synchronising hearings in crowded court lists imposes workload pressures on all parties. The present matter, while ultimately brought to hearing without undue further delay, saw multiple adjournments, notably due to Legal Aid funding disputes which impeded early appointment of independent psychiatric expertise.  

The Legal Aid Agency’s adjudication processes in this respect continue to attract justified criticism. Defence counsel’s application for funding to instruct Dr Naomi Clifford, a consultant forensic psychologist with expertise in patterns of repetitive non-violent offending, was refused initially on narrow evidential grounds before eventual approval was granted only after some six weeks. Such procedural wrangling, while not uncommon, hampers timely progress and is, frankly, inimical to justice, placing avoidable strain on both defendant and court resources.  

Despite these impediments, all parties have engaged with a commendable degree of professionalism. The prosecution, led by Ms Elizabeth Novak of the CPS Brighton office, and defence counsel Mr Daniel Fry, who has represented you throughout under a Legal Aid order, have cooperated to ensure the matter was ready for trial. The present hearing, therefore, marks the culmination of a contested process spanning almost three calendar years from first recorded offence to adjudication.  

This court takes a moment to recognise the tireless work of the prosecuting and defence teams alike, including court clerks and ushers who have maintained order and facilitated proceedings efficiently. The courtroom itself underwent refurbishment earlier this year, reflecting necessary investment in facilities amid otherwise difficult funding landscapes, improving accessibility and environmental controls for those present.  

It is regrettable, however, that the matter was delayed by the prolonged industrial action affecting judiciary and court staff in this jurisdiction during the spring of 2025. The cumulative effect of this strike action led to a backlog of cases and required rescheduling of multiple hearings. While unavoidable, its impact on defendants, victims, and witnesses should not be underestimated.

Substantive Legal Context  
Turning to the legal framework, the Theft Act 1968 remains the seminal statute governing dishonesty offences of this type. Section 1 provides the definition of theft encompassing dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner.

The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences, last revised in 2023, sets out the factors to be considered in determining an appropriate sentence including the value of stolen goods, frequency and duration of offences, use of concealment or evasion tactics, and impact on victims. The guideline also recognises that the emotional distress of retail staff, disruption to local businesses, and community harm are legitimate considerations beyond mere monetary loss.  

It is well established in appellate jurisprudence that the sentencing approach to such offending must be proportionate but deterrent, calibrated to the individual circumstances. To this end, the Court of Appeal’s decisions in R v Wilson [2022] EWCA Crim 805 and R v Darbyshire [2021] EWCA Crim 543 are instructive, reinforcing the necessity of holding persistent offenders to account whilst recognising genuine mitigation where proved. These authorities caution against unduly lenient custody thresholds and stress the need for community-based interventions where possible but only where they adequately protect the public interest.  

Additionally, reference may be made to R v Delaney [2020] EWCA Crim 1149, where the cumulative impact of repeated thefts from vulnerable premises, including pharmacies and small grocers, supported an immediate custodial sentence despite modest total financial loss. The Court was clear that the erosion of staff confidence and the elevated risk of escalation—whether in frequency or severity—were material considerations.  

Conversely, in R v Telford [2019] EWCA Crim 901, the Court emphasised that defendants making early guilty pleas and engaging with rehabilitative services should usually receive the benefit of substantial credit and consideration of community alternatives, particularly where mental health factors are demonstrated.  

Against this legal backdrop, I now turn to the factual circumstances before the court.

The acts underlying your conviction demonstrate planning and repeated engagement. You selected items bearing high retail value compared to their physical size, primarily targeting sections of the stores less observed by staffing, suggesting an awareness of detection risk. This was no haphazard impulse shoplifting but a methodical pattern.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Though your conduct was non-violent and did not involve intimidation or threats, it has prompted tangible detriment. Staff at one affected pharmacy reported increased anxiety and requests to modify shift patterns. Occasional workers left due to concerns about potential encounters. There is, therefore, a clear ripple effect extending beyond immediate financial loss to personal wellbeing and workplace morale.

The pattern of offending was repeated over a lengthy timeframe despite prior warnings and the offer of diversionary programmes by community liaison officers. This speaks to a concerning resistance to intervention.

The Crown also notes the impact on the retail suppliers who have been forced to install additional security measures and absorb the cost of replaced stock. While none of the premises involved are large-scale supermarkets, their loss is acute to small business sustainability and local employment.

Expert and Ancillary Reports  
The court has received a comprehensive psychiatric assessment from Dr Naomi Clifford, whose report was prepared following extended evaluation over three sessions in late August and early September 2025. Dr Clifford concluded that you do not meet criteria for any major psychiatric disorder but do exhibit features consistent with borderline personality traits including impulsivity and emotional dysregulation.  

Importantly, Dr Clifford notes that your offending appears linked to poor coping mechanisms in response to financial stress and social isolation. While you remain capable of adherence to structured community supervision, there is a significant risk of continuation absent effective intervention. The report recommends consideration of a structured programme incorporating cognitive-behavioural therapy focused on impulsive behaviour and decision-making alongside enhanced social support.  

The probation pre-sentence report, compiled by officer Ms Amina Sheikh, notes your lack of stable employment and housing insecurity. It also draws attention to your recent disengagement from voluntary support groups and highlights a degree of denial regarding personal responsibility. Ms Sheikh sets out several pathways for rehabilitation but cautions regarding compliance risk without close supervision.

The court is aware that mental health service provision in the Brighton and Hove area continues to face systemic pressures. Access to specialist outpatient services for individuals with complex personality difficulties is limited, with waiting lists extending several months. Nevertheless, the availability of community-based programmes such as the Brighton Cognitive Skills Initiative and local financial counselling services represent potentially valuable support options.  

Furthermore, the Probation Service is currently experiencing staffing shortfalls exacerbated by recent retirements and recruitment difficulties. Caseloads have increased significantly, challenging the provision of intensive supervision. This is not a criticism but rather an acknowledgment of operational realities faced nationally. The proper allocation of resource must be balanced against the need to manage risk in cases such as yours.

Additional Procedural Notes  
The court has received several letters of support submitted by your legal team, including communications from family members and representatives of the community centre where you intermittently volunteered. These documents attest to your recent efforts to stabilise your situation, though some remain equivocal as to future commitment.

Additionally, correspondence from the Brighton Retail Federation, while not specific to your case, outlines concerns regarding the steady increase in shoplifting across the city over the past five years. The Federation attributes this trend to a combination of economic uncertainty, social fragmentation, and changes in policing priorities. Such broader social factors, while not excusing individual misconduct, situate personal behaviour within a wider context.

It is also worth remarking on the impact of recent technological changes within retail security systems. The introduction of self-checkout tills, RFID tagging, and automated stock monitoring creates new challenges and opportunities for prevention. However, they also present evolving criminal opportunities, as noted in the 2024 report of the Home Office’s Retail Crime Taskforce.

Perhaps tangentially, the court was apprised during preparatory sessions of co-defendants in a related district prosecution involving fraudulent returns at a large department store. Though those matters bear no direct link to your case, they illustrate the complex ecosystem of retail-related offending.

While acknowledging these wider trends, the court emphasises its duty to focus strictly on your conduct and personal circumstances in determining an appropriate sentence.

Relevant Jurisprudence and Sentencing Principles  
Counsel for the Crown cited the decision of R v Evennett [2019] EWCA Crim 1018, where a repeated shoplifter with a substantial criminal record received an immediate term of imprisonment given the failure of previous community orders and the presence of unacknowledged offending.  

Conversely, defence counsel referenced R v Matthews [2022] EWCA Crim 334, highlighting the importance of recognising mitigating factors such as mental health difficulties and the utility of community sentences incorporating structured psychological intervention.  

The court recognises the importance of proportionate sentencing responsive to rehabilitation needs, as elaborated in the Court of Appeal’s guidance in R v Humphrey [2021] EWCA Crim 1708.

Societal Context  
It is essential to observe that these offences occur against a backdrop of significant social and economic pressures, including rising living costs, reduced access to safe housing, and constrained availability of mental health services. The court remains sensitive to such issues but reiterates that personal circumstances do not obviate legal responsibility.

The persistent rise in retail theft reflects, in part, the cumulative effect of austerity policies, social welfare retrenchment, and labour market shifts that disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. Some commentators argue that these developments have contributed to an erosion of social trust and reciprocity, creating fertile ground for opportunistic and compulsive offending.

Yet the justice system’s role is to mediate between individual accountability and societal understanding, ensuring that sentences promote public protection, offender rehabilitation, and public confidence.

Victim Impact and Community Harm  
Victim impact statements provided by affected retailers underscore the emotional strain inflicted by persistent theft upon small business operators and staff. While financial losses may be recoverable, diminished employee morale, the feeling of personal violation, and the imposition of additional security measures exact an intangible toll.

Statements from witness employees describe themselves as “on edge,” fearful during shifts, and sometimes feeling compelled to conceal their vulnerability.

It must be emphasised that the absence of physical violence in no way diminishes the seriousness of the harm caused.

In light of these considerations, this court insists that any sentence must sufficiently reflect the underlying harm to deter continuation and reassure the community.

Mitigation and Defendant's Position  
Your solicitors have outlined your expressed remorse, your willingness to engage with further support, and your personal challenges including unstable housing, recent bereavements, and the impact of longstanding financial difficulties.

Though these factors do not excuse offending, they may provide a framework to facilitate rehabilitation.

Whilst your plea was entered at trial, thus limiting credit, this court notes your acceptance of responsibility and offers partial recognition thereto.

I have considered all material presented, including your reported family circumstances, previous convictions, and current psychological profile.

The Court’s Approach to Sentencing  
The court is mindful of the need, under the Sentencing Council’s theft guideline, to consider custody only when the offence reflects high culpability and/or causes significant harm, and where community sentences would not adequately protect the public.

Given the protracted nature of your offending and limited engagement with support, the custodial threshold may be approached. However, the absence of violence, your personal circumstances, and the expert recommendation for structured psychological intervention indicate potential benefit from community supervision.

It will be necessary to weigh the public interest in deterrence and denunciation against the prospects for rehabilitation in the community.

I shall therefore defer sentence to allow preparation of
