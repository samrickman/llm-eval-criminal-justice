IN THE CROWN COURT AT READING  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13456  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge P. D. HARRINGTON  
Filed: 18 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing upon your conviction, following a plea of guilty, to offences of theft committed upon multiple occasions at retail establishments, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. Your offending spans a period from July 2023 to April 2025 and principally involves premises within the Reading borough and adjoining districts.

Procedural History  
Your initial arrest was effected on 15 April 2025, subsequent to a protracted investigatory operation by the Thames Valley Police in liaison with the Reading Business Crime Initiative, borne out of a discernible pattern of retail thefts targeting small to medium-scale outlets. Initial intelligence was supplied by a coalition of affected store managers and front-line security staff, who noted the reappearance of a male matching your description across a number of proximate locations. This resulted in coordinated evidence-gathering efforts including the acquisition of CCTV footage, staff statements, and electronic inventory reconciliations.

The volume and spread of such offences revealed a rather insidious pattern of continuing theft, which, though of individually modest value, cumulatively represented a material burden on business operators and employees alike. The collection and collation of the evidential base herein required significant cross-referencing and painstaking manual oversight given the variety of locations and times involved.

The matter was transferred to the Crown Court following your decision to enter a guilty plea on 30 June 2025, having initially pleaded not guilty at a first hearing on 12 May. It is noted that your ultimate admission came after the disclosure of forensic analyses and a substantial evidential bundle, by which time the strategy of denial had become untenable.

The operation of Better Case Management (BCM) procedures in this case was, on balance, satisfactory. Hearing dates were fixed in accordance with the indicative timetables mandated by the Criminal Procedure Rules. However, regrettably, the case experienced a brief adjournment on 17 September 2025 owing to delays in the submission and approval of a funding application for a forensic psychiatric assessment. The Legal Aid Agency’s administrative process in authorising this report was protracted, necessitating multiple reminders and correspondence exchanges. Such procedural delays, whilst unfortunately all too common, compromise the timely administration of justice and place avoidable strain upon all parties involved. It is to be hoped that future reforms address such systemic inefficiencies.

The court recalls previous findings in R v. Forsythe [2019] EWCA Crim 2178, where the Court of Appeal sternly remarked on the deleterious impact of procedural ambivalence on the fairness of trial preparation. Though the subject matter of Forsythe involved more serious offences of aggravated burglary, its principles regarding case management and timely expert evidence are germane to the present proceedings.

It must also be observed that the pressures upon frontline policing and criminal justice resources from increasing acquisitive crime remain considerable. A recent report by the Home Office, dated May 2025, highlighted a 14% increase in volume retail theft in mid-sized urban centres over the preceding three years, straining local policing teams already contending with violent crime, cyber threats, and emergency incidents. The comparatively low monetary value of the items stolen belies the systemic cost incurred, including diversion of officer time, impact on victims, and the chilling effect on business confidence and community safety.

The Safer Neighbourhoods Team in Reading has also submitted a community impact statement, reflecting the increased anxiety and operational challenges posed by repeated shoplifting offences. They document friction between police visibility and preventative engagement, aggravated by limited budgetary allocations and competing priorities.

The role of voluntary-sector organisations in this sphere is not insignificant. Of particular note is the Retailers’ Support Network (RSN), whose representatives have endeavoured to provide victim impact support and offender diversion programmes despite acute resource constraints. RSN’s written representations highlight the crucial interface they provide between affected businesses and the wider justice system. Their sustained advocacy for increased preventative funding, alongside case coordination efforts, constitutes a valuable, if underappreciated, contribution to public safety.

While the defendant’s offending does not carry the hallmarks of organised retail crime rings, it nevertheless exemplifies the insidious impact of persistent acquisitive offending on low-profit businesses and vulnerable workers. The staff of one establishment cited in their statement how continued theft has forced alterations to staffing rotas and the escalation of security measures, including installation of protective casings and emergency alarms, imposing financial and psychological costs beyond immediate loss.

Before proceeding further, I register my thanks to Ms Fiona Barclay, who appears for the Crown, and to Mr Simon Trevelyan, counsel instructed on your behalf pursuant to a full representation order. Both counsel have conducted themselves with appropriate diligence and professional courtesy throughout these proceedings.

It is customary, and indeed prudent, to reflect upon the relevant jurisprudential framework which governs sentence determination. The Theft Act 1968, having been the cornerstone of theft-related offences since its enactment, maintains primacy, specifically section 1 defining theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intent to permanently deprive.

The sentencing guidelines formulated by the Sentencing Council in 2024 provide the current compass for judicial consideration in such matters. Paragraph 2.18 of the guideline document recognises that while gross monetary sums escalate culpability, the pattern, persistence, and resultant impact upon victims and communities are equally critical. Aggravating factors include the targeting of vulnerable individuals, repeat offending, and use of deception or subterfuge. Mitigating factors hinge on early guilty pleas, expressions of remorse, good character, and engagement with rehabilitative services.

The courts must also exercise due regard to the overarching aims set out in the Sentencing Act 2020, balancing the purposes of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection.

Reference is hereby made, with respect, to recent appellate decisions such as R v. Cairns [2023] EWCA Crim 944, in which the Court reiterated that even low-level theft offences can set precedents in sentencing where the offender’s conduct reflects a clear pattern and demonstrates risk to community confidence. While the subject matter in Cairns involved fraud and deception rather than retail theft, the principles are translatable regarding cumulative harm and offender accountability.

More distantly, but not without instructive value, the decision in R v. Blackman [1986] 84 Cr App R 271 sheds light on the impact of repeated offending across multiple premises, setting a tangible boundary on judicial discretion in cases of persistence.

Turning to the particulars of your case, Mr H, the court has carefully reviewed the evidence. The facts of the case are as follows:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

The modus operandi evinced a guarded yet persistent approach, with selection of goods of perceived resale or personal use value, repeated visits utilising inconspicuous attire, and timing coinciding with less populated periods within stores.

An incident on 13 January 2025 involved your use of an unregistered payment card transaction which, while unrelated directly to theft, demonstrates a broader pattern of opportunistic conduct leading to suspicion among store security. Such complexities underscore challenges for investigators distinguishing between innocent error and deliberate deception.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

The series of thefts frequently included the removal of concealed security tags and utilisation of corridors between shelving aisles to avoid detection, indicative of premeditation. Your repeated presence occasionally provoked concern among staff and other customers, thereby affecting the ambience and sense of security of these retail spaces.

It must be remarked, though peripheral to your own actions, that a co-defendant involved in similar offences was noted for more aggressive conduct, alleged threatening behaviour, and non-compliance during arrest, factors not attributed to you but which contributed to public unease and media attention. Such elements, while not determinative in your case, provide a contrasting context illustrative of the spectrum of acquisitive offending.

Indeed, during a hearing on 3 September 2024, a trial involving alleged burglary following forced entry to a private residence several miles away led to the conviction of an unrelated party. That matter, while unrelated to you, attracted considerable local media interest and temporarily heightened tensions within the community. It is important to keep such context separate from the assessment of your conduct.

The cumulative effect of your offending was, accordingly, the diminution of staff confidence, alterations to working patterns to avoid lone shifts, and financial loss to premises already operating under commercial pressures exacerbated by inflationary trends and post-pandemic recovery challenges.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Correspondence from the Retail Recovery Network notes that affected businesses have invested in higher-specification CCTV infrastructure and staff safety training as a direct consequence of continued theft. These investments have diverted funds from other operational priorities, further underscoring the rippling effects of criminal conduct beyond immediate item value.

Psychiatric and Risk Assessments  
Following your counsel’s request, a forensic psychiatric report was obtained from Dr Helena Morley, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose assessment was conducted over the course of July and August 2025. Dr Morley’s report, dated 10 September 2025, reflects a detailed evaluation of your mental health, cognitive functioning, and behavioural history.

Dr Morley notes an absence of diagnosed psychotic or major affective disorders, but identifies features consistent with anxiety-related disorders and character traits possibly exacerbated by situational stressors including employment instability and housing precarity. No evidence was found of intellectual impairment or developmental disorder. Importantly, the psychiatrist highlights your limited engagement with available support services despite multiple offers from community outreach teams.

Dr Morley’s report references national research indicating that the risk of reoffending in cases of acquisitive offending diminishes markedly with active participation in tailored programmes, including cognitive behavioural therapy focused on impulsivity and financial management. The potential benefits of such interventions have been recommended for inclusion in any pre-sentence proposals.

Moreover, Dr Morley comments on your stated history of sporadic substance use, though no current dependence was diagnosed. These observations align with evidence in R v. Brandt [2017] EWCA Crim 364 on the relationship between substance misuse and acquisitive offending, though your case clearly lacks the latter’s aggravating volatility.

Dr Morley further cautions against simplistic attribution of criminality to socio-economic adversity alone. While the challenges you have faced are acknowledged, the failure to engage with ameliorative resources constitutes a material consideration in evaluating personal culpability and remorse.

Lastly, she recommends regular supervision and monitoring post sentence to mitigate relapse risk, emphasising that robust offender management frameworks are crucial in low-level persistent offending cases.

Letters of support submitted on your behalf include one from Ms Lorna Temple, a caseworker at the Reading Housing Support Service, vouching for your recent attempts to secure stable accommodation and attend advisory appointments. Also included is a letter from Mr David Jones, staff member at the Thames Valley Food Bank, confirming periodic engagement with welfare support.

These references, while commendable, also underscore the tenuousness of your current social support network, necessitating consideration in sentencing.

The Pre-sentence Report, provided by Officer Claire Dickinson of the Probation Service on 10 October 2025, details a moderate risk of reoffending, noting your previous offending history with three convictions for similar theft-related matters spanning 2017 to 2023. The report recommends options including a community order with strict requirements addressing offending behaviour, potential unpaid work, and mandatory attendance at accredited cognitive skills programmes.

It also underscores operational challenges faced by the Probation Service regionally, notably reduced staffing levels and increased caseload pressures, which may affect supervision intensity. Nevertheless, the report attests to your expressed willingness to engage in rehabilitative measures, provided appropriate structures are in place.

I note with some regret that the Legal Aid Agency’s approval of funding for the psychiatric assessment lagged procedural timetables, compounding delay in the resolution of your matter. Such bureaucratic inertia, as again observed in recent public inquiries, undermines the dignity of the justice process and obstructs defendants’ rights to fair and prompt determination.

The court acknowledges, of course, that your current social circumstances—precarious housing and sporadic employment—form a backdrop common to many who come before it. This should not, however, descend into a carte blanche for infringements of societal norms.

The impact of your offending, while devoid of physical violence or explicit threat, extends to the erosion of confidence within the business community and the imposition of psychological distress on employees required to work under heightened security anxiety.

Having regard to the statutory framework, established sentencing guideline, and the aggravating and mitigating features synthesised from the material before the court, the offence is to be treated as a category 2 level theft offence under the Sentencing Council guideline, given the pattern and persistence.

I am mindful as well of the observations in R v. Donovan [2024] EWCA Crim 1102, in which the Court externalised similar concerns over persistent theft conduct and the need to enforce sentences which prevent complacency about continued offending.

Having considered all relevant factors, including your plea of guilty at a relatively late stage, the limited but laudable engagement with support services, and your personal circumstances, this court is nevertheless compelled to conclude that a custodial sentence is not swiftly warranted. The emphasis must, for now, be on structured community measures with
