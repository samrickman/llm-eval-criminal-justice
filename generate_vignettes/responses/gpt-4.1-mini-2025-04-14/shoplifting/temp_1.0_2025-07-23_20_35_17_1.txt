IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHGATE  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/03127  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge C. F. Wrenford  
Filed: 17 October 2026  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentence in connection with charges of theft by shoplifting, contrary to the provisions of the Theft Act 1968, section 1. Your offending conduct, which spans a protracted period in late 2024 and throughout 2025, primarily occurred within the Boroughs of Southgate, Parkchester, and several adjoining areas of north London. 

Procedural Background and Case Progression  
This matter was initially brought before the Youth Magistrates’ Court in January 2026, where the district judge, exercising sentencing powers cognisant of the case's complexity, committed the case for trial at the Crown Court following an insistence by the prosecution that the facts warranted a custodial or community sentence of proportionate seriousness. The case was then allocated to this Crown Court circuit pursuant to the administration protocols governing contested indictable offences.  

The prosecution case was founded upon a substantial and diligently gathered evidential package compiled through a mixture of store CCTV footage, witness statements, and forensic analysis of retrieved items. Your initial arrest took place on 4 November 2025, following an orchestrated operation involving coordinated efforts between officers from the Metropolitan Police Service’s Neighbourhood Crime Unit and representatives of the Southgate Business Crime Partnership. This arrest followed several weeks of surveillance and intelligence-led policing aimed at disrupting a suspected ongoing course of theft linked to a very particular criminogenic pattern.  

As the court is aware, cases of this nature—though common in volume—present significant challenges both in terms of evidential quantity and the casework demands imposed on police and prosecuting authorities alike. This has been compounded in recent years by the increased strain on policing resources, aggravated by multiple public order duties and an expanding remit in relation to cyber-enabled crime. Nevertheless, the arrest and charge here reflect focused investigative attention and an attempt to safeguard both community businesses and the wider public interest.  

The evolution of case management in the Crown Court has seen noteworthy developments through the Better Case Management (BCM) regimes introduced under the Criminal Procedure Rules, designed to promote earlier resolution and reduce protracted litigations. This case was subjected to this procedure, with pre-trial hearings listed on 12 February and 26 May 2026, involving engagement with disclosure protocols, exchange of witness statements, and submissions on admissibility. I acknowledge the contributions of Ms. Elizabeth Rowe, representing the Crown, and Mr. Connor Pritchard, defending, both of whom have conducted proceedings with professional diligence despite a number of challenges stemming largely from operational delays in securing expert reports.  

Of particular note has been the repeated hesitance in affording legal aid certificates for the retention of a relevant forensic psychologist, which resulted in several adjournments, an all too frequent occurrence regrettably symptomatic of broader systemic pressures affecting defence representation and the delivery of justice. Those delays have no doubt placed additional strain on all parties and limited opportunities for earlier resolution.  

Throughout these proceedings, the Southgate Retail Crime Alliance has provided invaluable victim impact statements, documenting the impact of repeat shoplifting on local businesses, staff morale, and community confidence. Their detailed submissions, while circumspect and bereft of sensationalism, vividly portray the cumulative harm inflicted by persistent dishonest conduct upon micro-business owners and their employees.

The Court is conscious, however, that the law requires sentencing to be informed solely by facts established beyond reasonable doubt and those matters properly before the court. Hence, while the surrounding context and reputational considerations provide a valuable backdrop, sentencing must progress on the principle of proportionality and reference to relevant guidelines.

Historical and Jurisprudential Context  
The Theft Act 1968, and in particular section 1, remains the fundamental legislative provision under which offences of theft are prosecuted. Shoplifting, as a subset of this offence, has long been addressed within the ambit of at times evolving, and increasingly nuanced, sentencing guidelines crafted by the Sentencing Council. The latest iteration, issued in March 2021, seeks to balance deterrence, rehabilitation, and community protection specifically tailored to acquisitive offences of this nature. 

Reference must be made to the guidance encapsulated within R v. Grantham [2017] EWCA Crim 1956, where the Court of Appeal considered repeated offending in the shoplifting context, ruling that persistent, premeditated behaviour justified custodial outcomes notwithstanding modest individual values. The court noted, importantly, that the erosion of deterrence associated with repeated breaches affects not only individual victims but the wider societal fabric.  

Moreover, the Court is mindful of both R v. Bevan [2020] EWCA Crim 732, highlighting that late guilty pleas attract restricted mitigation, and the principles set out in the Sentencing Council’s “Definitive Guideline for Theft,” which admonishes a careful calibration of sentence length in reliance upon the culpability category and harm caused. Aggravating features such as repeat conduct, targeting vulnerable premises, and prior convictions are rightly accorded considerable weight.  

Finally, the court recalls the observations in R v. Mushqa [2019] EWCA Crim 1726, which underscored the difficulty of balancing community safety with the rehabilitation prospects of those found guilty of low-level acquisitive offences, particularly where deprivation and social marginalisation are prevalent factors.

Relevance of Ancillary Legal Frameworks  
It is germane to note, although not determinative of the present case, that the multi-agency interfaces engaged in this matter reflect an increasingly complex web of intervention, surveillance, and risk management. The Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conference (MARAC) procedures, while typically associated with domestic abuse fieldwork, have found partial application in certain acquisitive crime cases with vulnerable victims. Similarly, the Youth Offending Service's involvement offers avenues for exploring welfare and criminogenic needs, underscoring the manifold challenges faced in preventing recidivism.  

The court also acknowledges the broader environment of austerity-driven service contractions, in which probation services, mental health outreach teams, and community liaison officers operate within constrained budgets and substantial caseloads. These realities, though external to judicial deliberations, form part of the lived backdrop facing many defendants and victims alike.  

In this vein, the reliance on third-sector organisations, such as the East London Community Rehabilitation Charity and the local Council of Voluntary Services, has been indispensable, particularly in delivering wrap-around welfare assistance attuned to housing insecurity, substance misuse, or mental health challenges. Their submissions to the court furnish important context albeit carefully distinguished from the pure question of culpability and sentence.  

The following insert provides additional important details relating to offender behaviour and specific events leading to conviction.

The Impact upon Victims and Community Order  
While no acts of violence or threats accompanied the offending conduct, the cumulative effect upon staff working in affected premises is not to be underestimated. Victim impact statements submitted and read in open court illustrate significant psychological distress, frequent feelings of intimidation, increased workplace anxiety, and alterations to established work schedules as a direct consequence of the offending. Such consequences extend beyond monetary loss, encroaching upon the sense of security and wellbeing crucial for employees in customer-facing roles.  

There are broader societal consequences as well. Officers of the court are all too aware that an escalation in the rate and persistence of shoplifting can, over time, erode community cohesion and foster disillusionment with the criminal justice system. This can manifest in reduced reporting rates and diminished public confidence, which in turn jeopardises the effective policing of more serious offences.

It is therefore incumbent upon the court to calibrate sentences not solely in response to the offence and offender, but with an eye to those wider ramifications, highlighting the intricate balancing task faced by sentencing judges.

Psychiatric and Psychological Assessments  
The psychiatric report commissioned from Dr Felicity Harmon, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, provides insightful commentary on your mental and emotional state. Her observations point to the absence of any major psychiatric disorder but acknowledge traits indicative of intermittent impulsivity and difficulties with emotional regulation, compounded by a history of episodic low mood and occasional substance misuse.  

In her conclusion, Dr Harmon writes: “While Mr H does not meet criteria for a formal diagnosis of a personality disorder, his reported difficulties with handling stress and frustration, alongside minimal engagement with support services, increase his risk of further offending. Therapeutic intervention focusing on cognitive behavioural strategies is recommended.”

Though these observations do not, in the clinical psychiatrist’s view, justify diminished responsibility, they support the proposal for targeted rehabilitative programmes, which the Probation Service is invited to assess further.

Additional Contextual Considerations  
This court cannot ignore the recurrent and chronic pressures upon housing and homelessness services in London Boroughs, many of which directly affect the defendant population. The local authority has previously made representations noting the chronic shortage of affordable accommodation, reliance on temporary placements, and the attendant destabilising effect on individuals like Mr H. The interplay between such instability and criminal conduct is acknowledged but is not, and cannot be, a justification for offending behaviour.  

The observations made in the 2024 Joint Report by the Greater London Housing and Justice Forum on “Acquisitive Crime and Social Instability” remain pertinent, noting an upward trend in low-level theft associated with insecure housing and economic hardship. This report also highlights the capacity constraints of support services, exacerbated by funding cuts and increasing demand. While not determinative, it provides a sobering backdrop against which offences arising in such contexts should be viewed.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

The Role of Previous Convictions and Community Interventions  
Your previous convictions include four prior episodes of theft-related offending stretching back to 2018, with community resolutions on two occasions and a conditional caution in 2023. Despite warning and intervention opportunities, it appears that the pattern of behaviour remained unbroken until the recent escalation culminating in your current charge.  

Prior interventions by the community policing teams included advisory warnings, referral offers to community rehabilitation programmes, and temporary exclusion orders from certain shops under “Retail Crime Prevention Agreement” protocols. The persistence of your conduct despite these efforts must be regarded seriously and as a clear aggravating factor in sentencing.

The defence has highlighted the involvement of your sister, who provided a witness statement attesting to your efforts to seek employment and regain stability. I welcome that evidence as a sign of potential support, though ultimately sentencing must be rooted in the facts of offending and risk to public safety.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The Impact of Legal Aid Delays on Case Management  
The court records, with regret, the extended delays occasioned by the procedural handling of legal aid eligibility and expert instruction. Initial requests to instruct a clinical forensic psychologist were submitted in early February but did not receive authorisation until late April, with multiple requests for clarification and additional documentation cited as causes for delay. This contributed to the adjournment of sentence dates and remains a matter of concern not only here but in wider discourse about access to justice.  

Such obstacles place strain on defence advocacy and risk undermining confidence in criminal process fairness. It is to be hoped that ongoing reforms in the Legal Aid Agency and Ministry of Justice will reduce such occurrences in the future.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Public Protection and Sentencing Framework  
The Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences directs the court to consider the culpability and harm associated with the offending, together with the offender’s personal circumstances, antecedents, and the need to deter both the individual and others. Custodial sentences are reserved for cases where the offence is serious enough to warrant such punishment or where community measures would be insufficient to protect the public.  

The pattern of repeat shoplifting, particularly when calculated and prolonged, is an indicator of heightened culpability. The absence of prior violent conduct or threats does not neutralise the psychological impact on victims or the cumulative erosion of community confidence.

Where appropriate, the court may consider a combination of custodial and community-based interventions, including rehabilitative programmes addressing offending behaviour, substance misuse, or underlying social instability. The probation enquiry will play a vital role in formulating a sentence plan consonant with public safety and the promotion of your rehabilitation.

Closing Remarks  
For these reasons, I propose to defer sentence upon receipt of an updated pre-sentence report, which will include an assessment of your risk, rehabilitative needs, and the suitability of available sentence options, whether custodial or community-based. That report may also consider possible engagement with local services for housing stability and mental health support, should you be willing to accept such assistance.

I thank Ms Elizabeth Rowe for her detailed submissions on behalf of the Crown, and Mr Connor Pritchard for the defence submissions advanced in mitigation of sentence. I acknowledge the case workers and third-sector organisations who continue to advocate for balanced approaches to offenders such as Mr H, even amidst the significant operational challenges faced.

The court further expresses its appreciation to the court staff for their efficient management of the hearing list and the maintenance of decorum in these proceedings. The layout of this courtroom, recently refurbished, has permitted proceedings to be conducted smoothly despite the increased number of adjournments in the criminal caseload. 

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 October 2026, in Court 5 at Southgate Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentence outcome pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
