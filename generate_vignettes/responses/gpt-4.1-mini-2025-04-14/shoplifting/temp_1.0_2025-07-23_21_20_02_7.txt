IN THE CROWN COURT AT WESTMINSTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/05841  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. Morland  
Filed: 2 September 2026  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for offences under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically in relation to shoplifting incidents spanning a period of approximately fifteen months, from June 2024 until September 2025. The offending predominantly affected small-to-medium retail establishments across the Westminster borough and adjoining Westminster South ward.  

Procedural History  
The matter came before this court on 16 July 2026 for a plea and trial preparation hearing. There has been a somewhat protracted procedural history, attributable principally to delays in securing Legal Aid authorisations to instruct independent psychiatric expertise, as well as to the need to obtain further statements from witnesses and victim impact statements. Initial charges were brought on 20 December 2025 following an investigation coordinated by the Metropolitan Police Service’s Business Crime Unit in collaboration with the Citywide Retailers Consortium. This partnership sought to gather intelligence on rising levels of low-level acquisitive crime across commercial precincts. Despite the relatively limited severity of individual offences, there was evident concern that the cumulative effect of such behaviour was significant, requiring an organised criminal justice response.  

You were arrested on 18 December 2025, subsequent to an intensive intelligence-gathering exercise involving covert observation, analysis and cross-referencing of CCTV footage over multiple sites, as well as examination of electronic payments and contactless sensor logs. The investigation thus spanned several months and involved liaison with numerous retail staff, CCTV operatives, and community policing officers. The substantial volume of digital evidence necessitated careful forensic scrutiny, entailing the input of the Metropolitan Police’s Digital Forensic Unit between January and April 2026. This unit was operating under considerable operational pressure, simultaneously processing evidence arising from other serious cases, including ongoing investigations into Class A drug supply conspiracies and violent organised crime.  

The nature of this case—whilst primarily concerning non-violent theft—nevertheless engaged an intricate interplay of resources, reflecting a broader pattern in the contemporary justice system where minor offences nevertheless incur significant strain upon investigation and prosecution infrastructure. The Metropolitan Police Service has recently documented a 17% increase in reported retail thefts across inner London boroughs in the 2024 financial year, contributing to a wider trend noted in national crime statistics. These pressures underscore the importance of prosecuting such cases with both rigour and efficiency, a balance that this court endeavours to maintain.  

The Better Case Management (BCM) protocol was invoked early on in these proceedings, with initial case allocation dated 9 January 2026 and the standard case progression timetables broadly adhered to, notwithstanding the aforementioned delays caused by Legal Aid administrative requirements. Submissions by the defence counsel, Mr Leon Vance, included a request for additional witness evidence and the presentation of a psychiatric report commissioned from Dr Amanda Wu, a forensic clinical psychologist experienced in the assessment of acquisitive offending. That report was finally completed on 20 July 2026 and was accompanied by supplementary observations from the probation officer assigned to your case, Ms Eleanor Mathews.  

It is regrettable but necessary to record the multiple rounds of correspondence between Mr Vance and the Legal Aid Agency, with initial applications made in late February 2026 only being authorised in mid-April. Such bureaucratic logjams are an unfortunate recurring theme in recent years and have attracted criticism in reports published by both the Criminal Bar Association and the Ministry of Justice’s own Independent Review of Legal Aid Provision in 2025. Those reviews detail the impact of delayed funding on case preparation, counsel instruction, and ultimately on the timely administration of justice, particularly in cases involving vulnerable defendants whose mental health and rehabilitation prospects require thorough assessment.  

Before proceeding further, I should thank counsel on both sides for their diligent and measured submissions. Ms Courtney Holland, representing the Crown, presented the prosecution case with clarity and restraint. Mr Vance’s defence advocacy has been professional and conscientious. I also wish to acknowledge the court staff for their assistance in managing scheduling amidst the overstretched business court list, exacerbated recently by a judicial strike in June and July which necessitated a partial adjournment of non-urgent hearings.  

Recent Commentary on Institution and Society  
It is worth reflecting briefly on the broader socio-legal context within which this offending and its prosecution occur. We currently witness, across much of the United Kingdom, a noticeable rise in street-level acquisitive offences. This rise is correlated with a constellation of social issues, including heightened economic precarity, persistent unemployment in certain demographics, and the expanding demands on public services such as housing, social welfare, and mental health provision.  

The normalisation of low-level dishonest behaviour in some urban settings cannot be ignored, yet it must be understood within the complex interplay of structural disadvantage and individual agency. Local community groups have reported increased instances of intimidation and petty antisocial behaviour around retail hubs, affecting both business viability and neighbourhood cohesion. It is reported that at least one small independent grocer in the Westminster South area closed in early 2026, citing repeated losses and a climate of insecurity, to the detriment of local residents. Such closures reverberate beyond mere economic loss, contributing to diminished communal networks and the erosion of public confidence in law and order.  

It is also apparent that the retail sector itself is increasingly reliant on private security services to supplement policing, with many retailers employing door supervisors, CCTV operators, and alarm systems at considerable cost. The cumulative economic impact of shoplifting extends beyond the immediate loss of goods to encompass increased insurance premiums and heightened staffing pressures. Some commentators have noted a marked increase in part-time work hours being offered to staff to mitigate supervisory costs—measures which may ironically reduce staff presence and increase opportunities for crime, forming a kind of unfortunate feedback loop.  

More specifically, there is widespread concern over the strain on community mental health services. Waiting lists for assessments and therapy have lengthened substantially, with the NHS England and Department of Health’s monthly reports for the past year confirming delays of up to twenty weeks for access to specialist services intended to support offenders with mental health needs. This gap frequently leaves individuals with unmet needs cycling repeatedly through the criminal justice system without adequate therapeutic intervention, an outcome that courts and practitioners alike seek to avoid through the careful application of community disposals and tailored rehabilitative programmes.  

It must nevertheless be stated plainly that such societal factors cannot excuse the decisions leading to offending, nor diminish the necessity of accountability. The proper deterrence of such offences, protection of victims, and the safeguarding of public confidence are paramount in the court’s considerations.  

Legal Framework and Reference to Legal Authorities  
Turning more specifically to the applicable legal principles, section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 establishes the offence of theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it. Shoplifting, as a manifestation of such conduct, is routinely prosecuted under this framework, although the courts are mindful that culpability varies considerably according to the circumstances of the offence.  

In the context of sentencing, the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline on Theft Offences (effective from March 2024) remains the primary analytical tool. The guideline underscores the importance of factors such as the value involved, the sophistication or planning employed, previous convictions, and aggravating or mitigating features. Notably, repeated offending and targeting of vulnerable premises entail heightened seriousness.  

Though the present indictment consolidates multiple counts into a representative charge, this court must treat the charge as reflecting a sustained course of conduct. Such an approach preserves judicial discretion to recognise not merely the abstract nature of the charges but their practical implications.  

I also note the evolution in sentencing jurisprudence, as exemplified in R v. Beckett [2024] EWCA Crim 1132. That case involved serial thefts from charity shops across Leicester, with the defendant employing distraction tactics and exploiting the goodwill of volunteers. The Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence of 12 months, stressing the need to affirm the dignity of victims and protect community resources, even where offences may appear minor individually. Though Beckett differs factually, its ratio is certainly pertinent.  

Similarly instructive is R v. Collings [2025] EWCA Crim 2114, a decision concerning persistent shoplifting from high-end retail units in central London. There, the defendant was found to have organised accomplices and utilised sophisticated concealment measures. The Court of Appeal emphasised that the presence of organised modus operandi and reoffending despite prior warnings warranted a severe custodial penalty. While Mr H’s matters do not involve multiple accomplices or complex schemes, the principle that repeat offending aggravates culpability is highly relevant.  

Moreover, references to sentencing in R v. Hannaford [2023] EWCA Crim 1887 must be acknowledged. There, the issue of credit for late guilty pleas was thoroughly explored. The court reaffirmed that early pleas promote efficiency in the justice system and mitigate victim stress; conversely, pleas offered at trial or just prior to it attract reduced mitigation. The protracted progression of this matter inevitably impacts the availability of any discount.  

Further, consideration of the guidance offered in R v. Saleh [2022] EWCA Crim 1546, dealing with sentencing in cases exhibiting mental health factors, is appropriate. That judgment highlights the importance of balancing therapeutic needs against community safety. In Saleh, the Court upheld a suspended sentence for an offender with diagnosed bipolar disorder, with a strong community supervisory element, though only following demonstrated positive engagement in structured treatment. This court will reflect on this jurisprudence in light of the assessments before it.

It is necessary, of course, to turn to the specific details of the offending behaviour for which you now stand convicted. The facts, set against this wider legal and institutional framework, provide the basis upon which sentencing must be determined. As with all such assessments, the balancing of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and protection of the public must be scrupulously undertaken.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

The facts, drawn from comprehensive surveillance and corroborated by multiple witness accounts, demonstrate a pattern of deliberate and repeated offences, characterised by a modus operandi involving the concealment of goods beneath clothing or within bags, timed to coincide with moments when staff attention was distracted or insufficient.  

It may be noted for context that the co-defendant, identified as Mr S, who appeared in some incidents alongside you, opted not to plead guilty and faces separate proceedings scheduled for later this year. The distinction in culpability and procedural posture between defendants is carefully recognised by the court.  

More generally, it is worth reflecting that cases in which co-offenders adopt divergent pleas and differing levels of cooperation are not uncommon and present procedural challenges both to the Crown and defence, who must navigate complex evidential and tactical terrain.

The psychological assessment conducted by Dr Wu provides valuable insight into your mental state and its potential influence upon your conduct. Dr Wu notes symptoms consistent with emotional dysregulation, intermittent depressive episodes, and a mild degree of substance misuse — specifically, regular consumption of alcohol in amounts that exceed recommended guidelines but fall short of dependence. Further, the report identifies limited engagement with prior therapeutic services, including a truncated attendance record at a community mental health clinic in early 2024.  

Dr Wu remarks on the absence of a diagnosable major mental illness and stresses that your behaviour appears more influenced by social stressors and situational factors rather than organic pathology. Yet the presence of low self-esteem and impulsivity is noted as potentially contributory, albeit not exculpatory. The professional opinion ultimately declines to recommend inpatient treatment, proposing instead voluntary community interventions with psychological support and social welfare enhancements.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

The Pre-Sentence Report prepared by Ms Mathews from the Probation Service complements this clinical picture. It references your unstable housing history, including a period of tenancy in temporary accommodation arranged by the Westminster City Council Housing Department, as well as intermittent brief episodes of rough sleeping. This report conveys your reported lack of employment since March 2024 and identifies a history of sporadic educational attainment with no formal qualifications.  

Ms Mathews notes your inconsistent statements regarding family support, citing that you have mentioned contacts with an older sister living outside London, though records show no substantive engagement. It is also noted that you declined initial offers of referral to drug and alcohol services and that compliance with appointments has been variable since September 2025.  

While you express a desire to desist from offending, the report expresses caution regarding the risk of recidivism in the absence of sustained social and psychological support. The report advocates for a structured community sentence incorporating both rehabilitative and supervisory elements, though it recognises the possible need for custodial sanction if compliance is not forthcoming.

It is necessary at this juncture to acknowledge the victim impact evidence submitted by the City Retailers Coalition and by individual business owners. Among those affected was Mr Reginald Shaw, proprietor of Shaw’s Convenience, whose business suffered repeated losses and who wrote movingly of the stress endured by his staff. His letter explains how employees have requested schedule flexibility to avoid lone working during evenings—an adjustment with cost implications. Similar communications from the HealthPlus Pharmacy chain enumerate cumulative losses exceeding £1,500 and increased security expenditure.  

The evidence also includes statements from retail workers who reported feeling “uneasy” or “on edge” owing to the pattern of thefts, with one cashier describing a pervasive atmosphere of suspicion that lowered staff morale. Though no incidents of violence or threats occurred, the psychological impact of persistent, targeted theft must not be understated.  

It is evident that the economic and emotional consequences extend beyond the immediate statutory value of stolen items and must be factored into sentencing considerations.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

The Crown submits that the seriousness of the offences, the premeditation evinced, and the recurrence despite prior warnings and interventions collectively demand a custodial sentence. It is submitted that such a disposition affords the necessary denunciation and deterrence not only to this defendant but more broadly, to others who might contemplate similar offending.  

The defence challenges the proposition of immediate custody on grounds of your personal circumstances, gambling the hope that community-sanctioned measures may effectively support rehabilitation, particular in light of the absence of violence or threat, and your expressed willingness to engage with services moving forward.  

The court is also mindful of the escalating demands placed upon the Probation Service locally. Staffing shortages reported in the Westminster district branch have been acute, reflecting national data indicating a 22% vacancy rate among probation officers. These resource constraints hamper the delivery of robust community supervision but also underline the importance of targeted interventions that achieve meaningful behavioural change.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

It is also noteworthy that the business crime partnership involved has indicated readiness to facilitate restorative justice meetings, aimed at promoting accountability and reconciliation. Whether such meetings will be accepted and successful is contingent upon your engagement and conduct in the coming weeks and months. This court encourages examinations of restorative processes where appropriate, recognising their potential utility alongside more traditional sanctions.

Sentencing Considerations and Conclusion  
In sum, the offending represents a sustained course of conduct involving repeated dishonesty targeted at accessible retail premises, carried out with planning and awareness of risk. The cumulative harm to victims—both economic and emotional—is appreciable. The mitigating features are limited, encompassing your plea of guilty, albeit submitted later than might be hoped, and your expressed willingness to engage with rehabilitative services as noted by both clinical and probation reports.  

The court is keenly aware of the chronic pressures facing individuals experiencing housing insecurity and the compounded difficulties when mental health challenges and economic precarity intersect. However, these factors can mitigate neither the unlawful nature of the conduct nor the court’s duty to uphold the rule of law and public confidence in its administration.  

I will therefore direct the preparation of a detailed pre-sentence report with particular focus on risk assessment, suitability for community orders incorporating accredited offending behaviour programmes, mental health and substance misuse services linkage, and housing stability interventions. The Probation Service is asked to consider the prospect of a combined Community Order with requirements for rehabilitation activity, unpaid work, and attendance at mental health support appointments, where feasible and appropriate.  

Custody remains a live possibility should the reports indicate that community measures are unlikely to achieve necessary public protection or that compliance cannot be assured. The court notes that previous community resolutions were unsuccessful in deterring reoffending.  

I reserve final sentencing pending receipt of these reports and any updated representations.  

These are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge L. J. Morland, issued on 2 September 2026 in Court 8 at the Crown Court at Westminster. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 attach. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
