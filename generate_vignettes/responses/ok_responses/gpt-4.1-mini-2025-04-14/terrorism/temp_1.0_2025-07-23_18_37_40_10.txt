IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29384  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. F. WENTWORTH  
Filed: 18 August 2025  

Mr H stands before this court to be sentenced following his conviction on multiple counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct in question is alleged to have occurred between late 2022 and his arrest in January 2025.  

The defendant was apprehended during a coordinated counter-terrorism operation conducted by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) on 15 January 2025 at a residential address in Gloucester Road, Bristol. The operation followed months of surveillance and extensive intelligence assessment, including intercepts pursuant to authorisation under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. At the time of arrest, officers seized multiple devices including encrypted mobile phones, external hard drives, and chemical precursors.

Investigation into Mr H’s activities was complex and resource-intensive, requiring collaboration across several specialised units. CTPSW worked closely with the National Cyber Crime Unit and the Home Office’s Forensic Explosives Laboratory. The forensic digital analysis phase involved both decryption of secure messaging applications and reverse engineering of anonymisation software, efforts hampered by the defendant’s use of robust operational security measures.  

At an early stage, Mr H was released on bail with stringent conditions following the initial investigative interview. A number of bail applications and adjournments ensued, owing to ongoing forensic work and the defendant’s delayed legal representation. Notably, the late appointment of counsel was attributable to a brief suspension in Legal Aid panel allocations due to procedural requalification requirements. The delays occasioned thereby did not in the view of the court substantially prejudice the defendant’s position, but they serve as a reminder of practical challenges facing the justice system when balancing complex terrorism proceedings and resource limitations.  

The court acknowledges the persistence and dedication of law enforcement officers and civilian staff who manage the increasing volume of lower-tier extremism cases alongside those at the more serious end of the spectrum. Reports from police unions highlight disproportionate strain on frontline policing caused in part by escalating "non-serious" public order offences and an ever-expanding caseload of internet-enabled radicalisation incidents. This operational pressure cannot be overstated and it provides an important contextual background to the significance attributed by the prosecution to Mr H’s conduct.  

A pre-trial hearing was held on 20 May 2025, during which Mr H indicated a not guilty plea. Following service of the prosecution case and critical expert evidence, the defendant reversed his position and pleaded guilty at the commencement of trial on 5 August 2025. The Crown submits that, given the lateness of the plea, any credit afforded for it should be limited. The defence, whilst accepting the procedural timing, contends that notwithstanding the delay this plea represents an acceptance of responsibility meriting credit commensurate with at least a one-third reduction in sentence.  

The courts have developed clear principles on credit for guilty pleas. The Court of Appeal reiterated in R v. Longstaff [2024] EWCA Crim 326 the importance of early pleas made once facts become clear and before issue is joined, promoting judicial economy and mitigating victim distress. Conversely, late pleas entered at or immediately before trial, particularly following protracted disclosure and case preparation, attract more modest credit. It is further noted that tactical pleas made at the last feasible moment should not be rewarded unduly.  

In regard to sentencing structures under the Terrorism Act 2006, the statutory maximum for section 5 offences is life imprisonment, reflecting the potentially catastrophic risk such offending poses. Sentencing must serve not only punishment but also deterrence and public protection. The Sentencing Council’s definitive Terrorism Offences Guidelines (2023) require detailed consideration of culpability factors including the defendant’s level of commitment, the sophistication of planning, and proximity to causing harm. The court is also guided by the indicative case law on terrorism sentencing, including R v. Abdirahman [2018] UKSC 15 and R v. Anwar [2021] EWCA Crim 1235, which both emphasise the gravity of preparatory conduct regardless of actual harm caused.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

The ideological dimension of Mr H’s case was significant. Social media analysis indicates sustained engagement with various online forums noted for their radical rhetoric and proscribed content. His digital footprint revealed interaction with sites disseminating extremist propaganda and tutorials on improvised explosive devices. Linguistic profiling experts for the Crown tendered evidence that phrases in his encrypted messages bore marked similarity to texts from groups listed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Central to the prosecution case was a detailed forensic examination of digital artefacts. A partition on one of the defendant’s seized external drives, cryptographically concealed under an alias, contained blueprints for mechanical components consistent with use in homemade explosive devices. The defence submitted that these files could alternatively represent legitimate academic projects given Mr H’s engineering studies, but the court finds that, taken as a whole with corroborative encrypted communications, innocent explanation is untenable.  

It may be noted that forensic examination uncovered one anomalous file, a corrupted multimedia presentation that ceased at slide 37. Defence counsel argued this may evidence incomplete materialisation of intent, though as previous appellate rulings have made clear (see R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 1201), mere possession of partial manifestos or fragmented plans cannot be a failsafe exculpatory factor. The totality of evidential content must be assessed with prudent inference.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Curiously, the defendant’s social media history displayed intermittent benign interests, including regular postings of bird-watching photographs and astrophotography, which were cited in mitigation by defence counsel as evidence of a multifaceted character. The court recognises the potential for non-political dimensions in a defendant’s background, yet emphasises that these do not and cannot offset the seriousness of deliberate engagement in terrorism-related conduct.  

The court also acknowledges minor irrelevant artefacts discovered during the search of the defendant’s address, including an expired supermarket loyalty card for another individual resident, a disclaimer notice for a local arts centre, and a note detailing a domestic gardening schedule. Such items are naturally insignificant and have no bearing on the offence or sentencing considerations.  

It may be noted also, in passing, that the defendant's previous landlord reportedly received a noise abatement notice relating to a flat in a nearby building, but this unrelated matter has not been pursued in any further legal context and bears no direct relation to Mr H’s case.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

In light of wider investigative findings, it emerged that Mr H undertook international travel in mid-2023, including a symbolic trip to Brussels ostensibly for a professional conference on materials engineering. Scrutiny of this trip’s itinerary indicated attendance at locations previously identified as congregation points for extremist sympathisers. Countersurveillance data and public CCTV footage captured interactions with individuals later convicted of offences pertaining to the acquisition of explosive precursors.  

Disclosure in this matter comprised over 600 exhibits, many subject to official secrecy and subject to heavily redacted schedules to maintain national security. The extensive nature of disclosure and the need for carefully calibrated public access illustrate the fine balance courts must navigate between transparency and intelligence protection. There is an ongoing concern within the judiciary about the growing administrative burdens generated by the procedural safeguards in terrorism cases, including the operation of closed material procedures introduced under the Justice and Security Act 2013, which complicate trials and prolong preparation times.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial investigations discerned an electronic transfer of cryptocurrency totalling £3,150 from a wallet demonstrably under the defendant’s control to an intermediary known for facilitating discreet sales of dual-use components with potential military applications. Use of cryptocurrency in such a context demonstrates a deliberate attempt to obfuscate transactional trails.  

The court is cognisant of general debates surrounding the regulation of virtual currencies, including the thin line between technological innovation and facilitation of illicit activities. The recent House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs report (2024) warned that rapid adoption of decentralised finance technologies poses regulatory and enforcement challenges that impact national security. Such considerations underscore the gravity of Mr H’s actions within the broader framework of public protection.  

Adding to the gravity, police surveillance logs reveal that late evening visits were made by Mr H to known isolated locations reputed for clandestine meetings. The processing and analysis of such covert recordings consumed significant anonymous hours—a reflection of the disproportion between rapid criminal planning and slow detective work.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The defendant is currently 30 years of age, with academic qualifications including a master’s degree in mechanical engineering obtained at a provincial university. Employment records note a period of stable work at a mid-sized aerospace components firm, where supervisors commented favourably on his punctuality and technical aptitude. However, there was an abrupt resignation in early 2023 following an internal inquiry into unauthorised access of sensitive design files, which precipitated his withdrawal from the workforce shortly prior to the inception of the offending behaviour.  

Letters presented in mitigation from a local horticultural society commend his volunteerism in community green spaces, describing him as “quiet but conscientious.” The court respects the positive contributions Mr H made in these limited spheres but reiterates that such factors cannot diminish the severity of ideological offending that endangers the public.  

Correspondence from the regional probation office highlights persistent staffing shortages and the increasing complexity of supervising offenders with radicalisation risk factors. National probation reports from 2024 lament an 18% increase in caseload since 2020, combined with funding shortfalls that imperil effective offender management and reintegration. It is in this context that the court considers the appropriateness of custodial versus community-based disposals and the capacity for rehabilitation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Expert psychological assessments indicate that Mr H does not suffer from a formal mental disorder but displays rigid cognitive patterns typified by absolutist thinking and elevated threat perception. The consulting forensic psychiatrist highlights the substantial risk of sustained extremist engagement should release be unaccompanied by rigorous management.  

Defence submissions promote the possibility of structured disengagement through programmes such as the Deradicalisation and Disengagement Initiative (DDI). While the court recognises the value of such interventions, it remains mindful of the documented moderate success rates and high rates of dropout, particularly post-custodial supervision. A cautious approach is warranted, juxtaposing rehabilitation prospects with imperative of public safety.  

Mr H’s case must be viewed within the context of a society grappling with the hazards of technological acceleration, ideological fragmentation, and overburdened public services. In recent years, the phenomenon of self-radicalising ‘lone actor’ terrorism has presented profound challenges not only to law enforcement agencies but also to housing providers, educational institutions, and social care networks. The dislocation engendered by economic uncertainty and digital echo chambers contributes to patterns reflected in cases such as this.  

The court places on record its recognition of the dedicated work undertaken by the West Country Prevent Partnership. Their engagement with Mr H since 2022 demonstrates a measured approach of outreach, risk assessment, and referral, notwithstanding the defendant’s intermittent disengagement. Their professional contributions have provided valuable insight into the risk matrix and potential levers for intervention, underscoring the complex interplay between community activism and security mandates.  

Similarly, the commitment of CTPSW’s Tactical Financing Unit warrants acknowledgment. Their painstaking tracing of cryptocurrency flows amidst anonymity protocols provides an exemplar of modern investigative diligence, albeit one constrained by resource scarcity.  

The court notes that for defendants such as Mr H, the customary recovery of latent social support networks is often hampered by the stigma of terrorism convictions and resultant social isolation. Charitable sector entities, though lacking specialist expertise, have expressed willingness to support stabilisation post-release, contingent on firm oversight. However, the volatility of funding streams and staff retention issues in these organisations restrain their capacity.  

In reaching a view on sentence, this court must balance all these considerations. The defendant’s admitted culpability, advanced technical capacity, and ideological commitment position him at the severe end of the spectrum. The late plea limits the extent to which mercy can influence the final term. Yet, the court acknowledges mitigating features including the absence of previous convictions, the defendant’s academic and professional background, and the substantial preparatory work towards disengagement.  

The sentencing hearing has been conducted with decorum and professionalism. The court thanks Ms Fiona Ambrose for her diligent and comprehensive representation of the Crown, as well as Mr Martin Halloway for his thorough advocacy on behalf of Mr H. The court also extends gratitude to the clerk and usher staff for their efficient management of proceedings amidst ongoing refurbishment of the Bristol Crown Court building, which has at times posed logistical challenges.  

Finally, the court notes the unfulfilled role of the Legal Aid Agency in expediting the appointment of independent psychiatric expertise in a timely manner. Delays caused by bureaucratic complexities and funding limitations continue to impede the timely administration of justice, particularly in complex terrorism cases requiring specialist evidence. Such systemic shortcomings deserve urgent attention from policymakers and administrators to uphold the fairness and integrity of the criminal justice process.  

I therefore order the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the National Probation Service. The report should evaluate the defendant’s risk of serious harm, suitability for extended custodial sentences or extended licence conditions, and potential for participation in structured deradicalisation initiatives during and after imprisonment. Further attention should be given to accommodation arrangements compliant with MAPPA Category 3 risk management, electronic monitoring feasibility, and the availability of psychological assessment and support services accredited in Structured Professional Judgement tools.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal court record will be transmitted to relevant authorities for registration and subsequent enforcement.  

These are the orders of the court.
