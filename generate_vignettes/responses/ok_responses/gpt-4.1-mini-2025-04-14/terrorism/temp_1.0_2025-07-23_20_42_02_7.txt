IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/31562  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. L. GARRISON  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and a separate count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct in question is alleged to have taken place between autumn 2023 and his arrest in February 2025.  

The case has passed through the usual procedural stages associated with the Crown Court. Since his arrest on 5 February 2025, Mr H was first bailed to a secure location, then remanded into custody pending preliminary hearings. At the case management hearing on 15 April 2025, the court heard submissions on disclosure, with particular reference to the volume and complexity of digital materials seized. The Defence did not oppose an application for some material to be served under strict control owing to the sensitivities associated with national security considerations.  

It is pertinent to note at the outset that the CCTV recording technology within the courthouse was upgraded in May 2024, leading to improved image resolution in the courtroom but introducing some challenges in video conferencing compatibility that delayed early remote participation in hearings for a number of solicitors involved in the defence teams of related cases. Those matters, while incidental to the substantive proceedings here, set an unfortunate procedural backdrop to these proceedings.  

The Crown Prosecution Service has secured the attendance of Ms Olivia Grant, Senior Specialist Prosecutor in the Counter-Terrorism Division, who has led the case. I take this opportunity to commend both Crown and Defence Counsel for their thorough approach to the presentation of submissions and evidence, despite the often labyrinthine burden imposed by voluminous material.  

During the initial bail application hearings, it became apparent that the Legal Aid Agency was unable initially to authorise the level of preparatory legal work required for the defence to instruct forensic digital analysts, leading to an adjournment on 27 March 2025 to resolve funding. The court acknowledges the effort of Mr James Kilpatrick, Defence Counsel, in pursuing the matter with determination, but cannot remain unsympathetic to the well-documented systemic delays currently plaguing Legal Aid administration. These delays serve neither justice nor fairness in cases of such gravity and complexity.  

In addressing the statutory context, it is necessary to recall that section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 creates significant powers to prosecute preparatory acts linked to terrorist intentions—recognising the imperative to intervene before acts of mass harm can eventuate. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment. The sentencing framework outlined in the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Guidelines 2023 demands a careful evaluation of culpability, harm, and mitigation, taking into account factors such as sophistication, intent, and anticipation of violence.  

R v. Nisar [2011] EWCA Crim 1296 is a useful touchstone here, reinforcing that even preparatory conduct which falls short of direct violence may attract severe penalties where it evidences significant commitment to terroristic ends. Equally, the leading case R v. Awan [2012] EWCA Crim 1700 underscores the weight placed on the nexus between possession of material means and the anticipated capacity to cause harm. These authorities inform the custodial expectations in the present matter.  

It is noteworthy that in previous cases, such as R v. Finch and others [2019] EWCA Crim 403, the courts have grappled with the difficulty in balancing legitimate freedoms of expression with the necessity to combat extremism. While those cases involved public speeches and dissemination of radical ideological content, the conduct here extends into the realm of practical preparation and possession of specialist articles.

The offences arose within a societal context marked by increasing concerns about not only domestic radicalisation but also the influence of international extremist propaganda disseminated through encrypted Internet forums. The court is reminded by recent Home Office reports of the ongoing efforts across government agencies to modernise inter-agency data sharing and intelligence coordination, efforts that have led to refinement in identifying emerging threats.  

The period under review, 2023-2025, has seen heightened operational activity in Counter Terrorism Policing networks, including, but not limited to, the deployment of novel signal detection methodologies and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) extrapolations. While the public may not be fully aware of such technical endeavours, their role in the pre-emptive disruption of plots is a crucial layer of protection. Yet, regrettably, the resources demanded by these operations exacerbate the existing understaffing in local policing units, stretching constabulary capacities ever thinner. This strain manifests in delayed response times to “non-serious” crimes such as shoplifting, anti-social behaviour, or minor assaults—issues which, while peripheral, contribute tangentially to the broader public safety challenge.  

In the preliminary considerations, it is also appropriate to note that the defendant's residential circumstances have contributed to complexities in social support provision. Mr H resides in a multi-occupancy dwelling in an inner-city area characterised by elevated rates of housing instability and periodic noise complaints, including multiple statutory abatement notices served on the building’s owner over the past two years. While the tenancy matters are not directly attributable to Mr H, such an environment may affect engagement with community support services.  

The defendant was subject to a channel intervention notice following an internal referral by educational authorities in 2019 after his submission of an extended coursework assignment reflecting controversial political themes. The extent and efficacy of subsequent intervention have been subjects of competing submissions; the Channel panel discontinued formal oversight in early 2020, citing insufficient ongoing concern. The court notes that such panels operate within strict resource constraints and under considerable political scrutiny.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

In his written and oral submissions, defence counsel has urged that Mr H’s online activity—blogposts, social media commentary, and video uploads—should be viewed in the light of youthful idealism rather than actionable endorsement of violence. The Crown disputes this interpretation, relying on linguistic and behavioural evidence indicating a considered progression from rhetorical radicalism to concrete preparation.  

Technological evidence played a substantial role in this matter. Digital forensic examination uncovered a range of encrypted folders, the contents of which included annotated instructional manuals identifying the technical parameters of improvised explosive devices. As Lord Justice Holman observed in R v. Brooke [2020] EWCA Crim 1116, possession of such manuals coupled with preparatory acts evidences a distinct and prosecutable step beyond mere extremist opinion.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The court heard extensive expert evidence regarding the technical sophistication of materials found in Mr H’s possession, including schematics for remote detonation systems. Defence submissions referenced possible alternative explanations, such as legitimate hobbyist interest in electronics or model-making activities, a defence not uncommonly advanced but difficult to sustain in the context of cumulative evidence.  

Further, the cumulative nature of the evidence was testimonial to the methodical and deliberate nature of the preparatory activity. The law requires that sentencing reflect not only isolated actions but also patterns demonstrating culpability and risk. As Holmes LJ noted in R v. Elahi [2017] EWCA Crim 1234, sentencing in terrorism offences demands recognition that preparation for indiscriminate harm is intrinsically grave.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

The court also considers contextual irrelevant matters which, while mentioned during submissions, shed little light on culpability but illustrate the breadth of information sifted by investigators. For example, a small cache of home-produced elderflower cordial was recovered, alongside documentary evidence of participation in local cultural festivals that bore no connection to criminality. Similarly, defence cited archival entries referring to Mr H’s attendance at community music workshops in 2018—wholly unrelated to the offences charged but revealing of a multi-faceted personal history.  

The court welcomes the comprehensive probation report, which outlines Mr H’s background, family circumstances, and educational achievements. Citizen engagement through voluntary environmental groups emerged repeatedly across references received. The report notes that while Mr H was assessed as posing a high risk of serious harm related to ideology-driven offending, no evidence of underlying mental health disorder was detected, a conclusion supported by psychiatric examination.  

One observes, with some regret, that the delivery of these services and evaluations was occasionally hampered by delays attributable to ongoing NHS forensic psychiatry waiting lists. Such systemic issues, highlighted in recent publicly available Department of Health and Social Care annual reports, represent a troubling reality for many courts and contribute to protracted scheduling of sentencing hearings.

Historically, criminological literature has noted that travel to certain high-risk jurisdictions often constitutes a concerning indicator. In this case, travel documentation reveals that Mr H made a brief visit to the European continent in mid-2024, nominally for tourism. Intelligence records place the defendant in proximity to individuals subsequently arrested on separate terrorism-related charges unrelated to Mr H. The Crown’s submissions underscore associations through encrypted messaging platforms that appear non-coincidental.  

It is appropriate also to address the question of defendant’s communications with co-accused Mr S, who was involved in an attempted shipment of controlled substances in mid-2023. Mr S’s offending included the importation of approximately 3.5 kilograms of heroin, having evaded customs controls on several occasions. While Mr S pleaded guilty and received sentence accordingly, these offences bear no direct attribution to Mr H, though the Crown advanced evidence of their acquaintance and encrypted correspondence. It is essential, for the avoidance of doubt, that the court does not conflate the distinct criminal activity of co-defendants with that of Mr H. The principle of individual criminal responsibility applies rigorously.  

In considering the wider factual landscape, the court also notes the trial judge's prior decision in adjacent cases reflecting concern over growing occurrences of graffiti tagging on public transport infrastructure and its correlation with transient youth anti-social groups, unrelated to terrorism but indicative of broader social malaise. Such peripheral matters, whilst germane to community policing efforts, cannot be extrapolated to diminish the seriousness of offences at hand.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Digital currencies featured prominently in the evidence. Blockchain analysis traced multiple transactions amounting to over £3,000 in Bitcoin equivalents moving from accounts linked to the defendant to wallets associated with darknet marketplaces. The court is reminded—as amply documented in the recent National Crime Agency report on financial crimes—that cryptocurrency’s dual-use potential is an ongoing and significant challenge for law enforcement. The ability to obfuscate origins and beneficiaries demands nuanced regulatory and investigative responses.  

Nonetheless, it must be emphasised that the court’s role is not to critique economic innovation but to weigh available evidence that such means may have been used to facilitate the provision of technology or materials with potential application in terrorism. That the defendant utilised this means reflects neither the novelty nor the harm but forms part of a larger pattern.  

The Crown also presented covert surveillance logs from an incident where Mr H was recorded entering the grounds of an abandoned industrial estate, location previously associated with the staging of anti-social behaviour and several unauthorised gatherings. Reconstruction of lighting levels and synchronization of multiple camera views necessitated considerable forensic expertise—reflecting the heavy resource demands placed upon specialist officers so pressured by mounting case loads.

Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is aged 30 and holds a higher national certificate in electronic engineering. Formerly employed as a junior technician at a renewable energy firm, he resigned abruptly in August 2023 after a confrontation over security vetting procedures. His employer’s letter describes him as “conscientious but private”—a characterization echoed by various acquaintances who also discussed his growing disengagement from mainstream social networks and increasing presence on encrypted messaging applications.  

Letters of support from a local community allotment association attest to Mr H’s contribution to collective gardening efforts, an activity which, whilst laudably pro-social, remains tangential to his offending conduct. Such engagement was also noted by a charity specialising in outreach to individuals at risk of social isolation, though their attempts to maintain contact with Mr H after his arrest were unsuccessful.  

Defence counsel has referred repeatedly to Mr H’s “quiet dedication and quick intellect,” but the court must caution against conflating personal qualities alone with mitigating factors absent evidence of genuine remorse or rehabilitation. In R v. Mullen [2015] EWCA Crim 124, the Court affirmed that character references must be weighed objectively against the gravity and nature of offences.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The psychiatric report prepared by Dr Ibrahim Malik of the Midlands Forensic Psychological Service diagnoses no formal psychiatric illness but highlights a pattern of cognitive rigidity and extremist belief adherence. Dr Malik describes a high risk of reoffending unless intensive psychological supervision is maintained post-custody. The risk assessment incorporates structured professional judgement tools, which assign the defendant a “high” likelihood of harm without tailored interventions.  

Consideration has been given to the availability and capacity of deradicalisation programmes, many of which operate under the supervision of the Prevent Duty framework. These programmes have a mixed record of success, hampered by voluntary engagement models and the absence of statutory compulsion beyond licence conditions. The court is well aware that the effectiveness of such schemes is under constant review and reliant on multidisciplinary cooperation that faces recurring budgetary challenges.  

In mitigation, it is noted that Mr H had no prior criminal convictions of any kind. His admission of guilt, entered pursuant to the case management hearing on 12 September 2025, is accepted but given its timing—subsequent to extensive preparation for contested trial—the credit afforded is necessarily limited. The defendant has expressed remorse in a written statement, which the court has read with due regard, but amends his previous reticence only belatedly.  

In addressing sentencing ranges, the court considers the highest culpability bracket under the current Guidelines. Mr H’s actions involved not only theoretical preparation but possession of materials with practical application geared to indiscriminate attack, coupled with evident knowledge and intent. Aggravating features include the methodical nature of preparation, the encryption of communications, and association with known extremist circles.  

The court recognises, as always, the delicate balance between individual liberties and collective security. The need for deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection must be calibrated with equity. This case is a stark reminder of the long shadow terrorism offences cast over communal trust and safety.  

The probation service is directed to prepare a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing risk management, suitability for extended determinate sentencing, and prospects for engagement with behavioural intervention programmes. Particular attention should be given to the feasibility of conditions including electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, and ongoing psychological evaluation. The report ought also to consider accommodation stability and vocational reintegration possibilities post-release.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in the Courtroom of the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate custodial and supervisory authorities.  

These are the orders of the court.
