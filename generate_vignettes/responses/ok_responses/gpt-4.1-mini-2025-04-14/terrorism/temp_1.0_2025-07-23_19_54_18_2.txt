IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/31784  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. J. Callaghan  
Filed: 4 October 2025

Mr Mr H stands before the court facing conviction on counts of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending alleged spanned the period from late 2022 until his arrest in early 2025. 

This case details a complex investigative process that culminated in Mr H’s arrest in the early hours of 14 January 2025, when officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West executed a series of warrants at his residence in the Hascombe district of Bristol. These warrants were authorised pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000, on the basis of intelligence contributions by the Security Service, indicating that encrypted communications linked to Mr H were utilising messaging protocols commonly employed for extremist propaganda dissemination and operational planning. At the time of his arrest a quantity of electronic devices including laptops, encrypted phones, and unregistered hardware components were seized for forensic analysis.

The collaborative efforts underpinning the investigation were substantial and sustained. Counter Terrorism Policing South West worked in close liaison with officers from the Digital Forensics Unit of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, with digital triage supported by specialist analysts seconded from the National Cybercrime Programme. The painstaking examination of encrypted containers, spanning multiple file systems and employing layered key encryptions, was hindered by the use of bespoke anonymising virtual environments fashioned within live Linux instances with heavily obfuscated kernels. The forensic timeline, extending over twelve months prior to the arrest, is testimony to both the complexity and resource-intensive nature of modern counter-terrorism digital investigations. In this respect, it is worth recording that demands on the National Cybercrime Programme routinely exceed available capacity, leading to triage backlogs exceeding six months. This exacerbates the challenges posed by the rapid evolution of encryption and anonymisation tools.

The court notes that during the initial bail period following charge, Mr H was twice remanded under section 47 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 due to administrative difficulties in procuring disclosure of certain intelligence-derived intercepts. These delays, while regrettable, are not uncommon in counter-terrorism cases involving sensitive source material, which require highly cautious vetting due to the potential for compromising ongoing operations or endangering informants. It must be understood that such procedural safeguards, designed to preserve operational integrity, are not merely technical shackles but essential to the balance between individual rights and collective security.

Of note, a Prevent referral predates the investigation by some three years. A safeguarding concern was raised in May 2022 by an HE-level sociology lecturer at St. John's College, Bristol, arising from Mr H’s submission of a coursework essay containing extensive uncritical quotations from proscribed extremist manifestos. The Channel panel convened to consider the referral, but in the absence of behaviour indicating progression towards material support or dissemination, it was discontinued after Mr H attended two brief advisory sessions. Whilst this decision may now appear in retrospect open to scrutiny, the court accepts that Channel interventions rely on contemporaneous evidence and are not clairvoyant.

A Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing was scheduled for 18 July 2025. Mr H initially entered a not guilty plea. Having proceeded through case listing and jury empanelment arrangements, the defendant changed that plea to guilty on the morning of the first day of trial, 29 September 2025. The Crown opposes affording the full credit associated with an early guilty plea, given the lateness of admission and the considerable mobilization of court and witness resources prior to this concession.

It is important the court reiterate principles established in appellate authorities concerning reduction for guilty pleas. In R v. Branscombe [2023] EWCA Crim 2017, the Court of Appeal held that the timing of guilty pleas remains central to the assessment of credit, with pleas entered only after the trial has commenced meriting significantly reduced discount compared to those entered at the first reasonable opportunity. The rationale addresses both the conservation of public resources and the alleviation of distress to victims and witnesses. The Court further noted in R v. Minns [2024] EWCA Crim 405 the critical role of the defendant’s demonstration of genuine acceptance of responsibility, as opposed to tactical expediency.

Mr H’s conduct must, however, be understood in the broader legislative framework governing terrorism sentencing. The relevant statutory provisions impose a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for such offences. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline (2023 edition) directs the assessment of factors such as motivation, sophistication, operational preparation, and risk to public safety when establishing culpability. Cases of particular relevance include R v. Suraj [2018] EWCA Crim 1653, underscoring the necessity of deterrent sentencing in the face of pre-attack preparatory conduct, and R v. Obaya [2021] EWCA Crim 1245, which affirms lengthy extended sentences where there is evidence of an intent to cause mass casualties.

Digital intelligence identified that Mr H maintained a blog titled “Echoes of Conquest,” which evolved from innocuous historical commentary in early 2022 towards increasingly ideologically radical content by mid-2023. The Crown presented linguistic analysis revealing phraseology echoing publications recognised as extremist tracts by the Home Office Counter Terrorism Division. This progression in thought-space was accompanied by encrypted communication with individuals linked to foreign proscribed networks known to disseminate bomb-making manuals.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

The defendant possessed multiple encrypted data archives within secure partitions accessed via a pseudonymously maintained email account. Several of these corresponded to files containing highly technical schematics relating to explosive device construction, confirmed as matching those previously seen in successful prosecutorial cases, for example, R v. Mahmoud [2019] EWCA Crim 342. Defence arguments advanced the proposition that partial corruption of certain files indicated no actual access or usage; these submissions were considered but ultimately rejected in light of the broader evidential context.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Similar investigative rigour characterised the covert surveillance operation. The court is cognisant of the operational challenges: the relevant officers relied upon a cumbersome amalgam of CCTV, mobile device logs, and location tracking vying with limitations imposed by the need for judicial authorisation and data retention constraints. The cost and complexity of validating a single suspect movement have, on occasion, taxed the operational bandwidth of counter-terror units. It is illustrative that over 1200 analyst hours were expended reviewing video footage from multiple angles to substantiate Mr H’s presence near key assembly points.

The court further notes, though it bears no relevance to the terrorism offending, that a quantity of cannabis was recovered from the accommodation during search. This admitted breach of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 is not admitted in these proceedings nor aggravating in this context but appears within defence submissions attempting to represent typical youthful experimentation rather than ideological commitment. Such mitigation was given no weight.

The Crown detailed international travel undertaken by Mr H in late 2023, including a week-long stay in Antwerp purportedly for commercial trading research. Passport and border control data demonstrated that during this period he made repeated visits to a locality known for hosting extremist-affiliated gatherings. These associations were overlain by encrypted telephony evidence connecting him to a network subsequently disrupted in a separate operation in Belgium. Defence submissions challenged the inference of intent but the court finds the totality of evidence compelling.

A brief digression to case law is warranted here. The appellate decision in R v. Lambert [2020] EWCA Crim 650, which concerned importation of illicit firearms, emphasised the corrosive effect of international facilitation networks on local radicalisation. Though materially distinct in factual matrix, the principles relating to demonstrable intentionality and stages of preparation have parallel relevance to this case.

Further to the procedural process, the defence instructed a psychiatric assessment to consider Mr H’s mental state and risk profile. The evaluation was conducted by Dr Felicity Whittaker, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist at Avon Secure Hospital, whose detailed report dated 12 August 2025 was placed before the court. Dr Whittaker observed that while the defendant displayed “intense ideological rigidity” accompanied by elevated cognitive fixation on grievance narratives, he showed no diagnosable psychotic or mood disorder. Mr H’s general cognitive function was noted as average with specific deficits in executive flexibility and empathy modulation. The report emphasised a high risk of serious harm without rigorous intervention and containment, particularly given the defendant’s skill set.

Correspondence from the Bristol Probation Trust dated 22 September 2025 detailed the unavoidable staffing shortages within the local probation service, affecting allocation capacity and supervision intensity. This is a point which, while peripheral, contextualises challenges in managing convicted individuals with high-risk profiles in the community, especially in cases requiring multi-agency coordination.

Financial transaction analysis revealed cryptocurrency movements traced to the defendant’s various pseudonymous wallets, the largest single transfer amounting to £1,820 in Bitcoin equivalent to a vendor advertising dual-use electronic components. Such facilitation of procurement for nefarious purposes exemplifies the increasing technical sophistication within the offending class, highlighting the risks posed by virtual assets to oversight and interdiction.

The court reflects on the broader societal context in which these offences unfold. Public services face unprecedented pressures from a plethora of demands ranging from social welfare, mental health crises, to economic precarity. The corridor outside this courtroom observes individuals affected by homelessness, substance misuse, and diminishing community cohesion. While the justice system cannot resolve these systemic issues, it must remain vigilant to the dangers posed when radicalisation finds fertile ground in fractured social environments.

The court also wishes to place on record its appreciation for the professionalism demonstrated by the officers in the Digital Forensic Unit, often working under considerable strain and with outdated software tools, yet delivering painstaking and meticulous analysis that forms the backbone of prosecutions in this complex field.

Professor Simon Dwyer, in his seminal text *Terrorism and the Rule of Law* (Oxford, 2021), articulates the delicate balance courts must strike between safeguarding civil liberties and effecting rigorous public protection. It is this balance that the court here endeavors to maintain.

Attention is drawn to the defendant’s personal history. Mr H is 30 years of age, educated to postgraduate level in materials science, and was formerly employed by a major aerospace manufacturer until his resignation in autumn 2022. His line managers portrayed him as “competent but increasingly withdrawn,” noting a marked downturn in punctuality and workplace engagement towards the latter months. A disciplinary inquiry preceded his departure, centred on use of company systems to access extremist publications. Such professional background emphasises the defendant’s technical knowledge and capacity for detailed operational planning.

Letters of support were submitted from a local youth charity, Eastside Outreach, commending Mr H’s involvement in mentoring younger members in community gardening projects. While such civic contribution is commendable, the court reiterates that acts of social responsibility cannot excuse or mitigate the planning of indiscriminate violence. Good character references, as illuminating as they may be, do not outweigh the gravity of the offending.

Professor Hannah Morley, consultant forensic psychologist, has provided an analysis under Structured Professional Judgement guidelines. Her report underscores the defendant’s entrenched ideological positions, risk of re-engagement with extremist networks post-release, and the limited but not negligible prospects for rehabilitation under enhanced supervision. The possibility of engagement in structured disengagement programmes such as the De-Radicalisation and Disengagement Framework was raised by defence counsel; however, the court is cognisant of evidence indicating variable completion rates and the risk of recidivism without validated ongoing risk management.

The court must not lose sight of the primary objectives of sentencing in terrorism cases: deterrence, denunciation, public protection, and rehabilitation, as enshrined in the Sentencing Code and reinforced by case law including R v. Haroon [2024] EWCA Crim 703. The markedly serious and calculating nature of Mr H’s conduct falls within the highest culpability band under the definitive guidelines. Aggravating features include the weaponisation of technical expertise, the timing of preparatory acts to coincide with remembrance dates of previous terror attacks, and the deliberate choice of targets with high civilian density.

Mitigating factors are confined to the defendant’s hitherto clean criminal record, his educational attainments, and the late guilty plea. The court accords a modest plea credit of one-sixth, reflecting the tactical timing and limited early acceptance of responsibility.

The court orders the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report addressing the suitability of an Extended Determinate Sentence with ancillary licence conditions including electronic monitoring, prohibitions on internet access, and mandatory engagement with specialist psychological interventions. It must assess the feasibility of residence in approved premises, the availability of High-Intensity Psychological Therapy units, and the potential for involvement in structured community resilience initiatives upon eventual release.

These sentencing remarks are promulgated today, 4 October 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been transcribed according to the requirements of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Notification of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to relevant authorities for enforcement and oversight.

These are the orders of the court.
