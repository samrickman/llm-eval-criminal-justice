IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/30216  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge G. M. FRANCIS  
Filed: 28 August 2025  

Mr Mr H stands before this court charged with two offences pursuant to the Terrorism Act 2006. Specifically, he has been convicted of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The time frame for the offending stretches from approximately September 2023 until the defendant’s arrest on 11 March 2025.  

The defendant was apprehended in the early hours of the morning on 11 March 2025 at a residential address in the Easton area of Bristol, following the execution of a warrant authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 by officers of the Counter Terrorism Policing South West unit. The warrant was supported by intelligence supplied by the Security Service based on intercepts of encrypted communications. At the time of arrest, Mr H was in possession of several electronic devices including a laptop, a mobile phone, and multiple USB storage devices.

This case is emblematic of the evolving challenges faced by law enforcement and security agencies in dealing with ideologically motivated offending. The investigation that culminated in Mr H’s arrest was of a complex and resource-intensive nature, involving not only traditional surveillance and human intelligence, but also sophisticated digital forensic analysis and cross-jurisdictional collaboration. It bears mentioning that the national Cybercrime Centre was engaged in the decryption and examination of encrypted communications recovered from the defendant’s devices, requiring the deployment of advanced techniques with no small expenditure of time and expert effort.  

The delay in obtaining some aspects of disclosure exemplifies the difficult balance between securing operational secrecy and ensuring a fair trial. Notwithstanding the delays, which included extended periods of pre-trial bail under stringent conditions, the court is satisfied that these did not prejudice the prosecution or impede the defendant’s ability to prepare an adequate defence.  

It is perhaps germane to observe, though not directly germane to Mr H’s offending, that the court has been apprised of a recent case from the Western Circuit, R v. Green (2024) EWCA Crim 756, dealing with the illicit importation of pyrotechnics intended for use in industrial sabotage. While the facts and legal context differ materially, the appellate assessment of public protection considerations advanced there provides a valuable jurisprudential backdrop to the present proceeding.  

The procedural history of this case reflects, with some degree of frustration, the continuing strain upon criminal justice timetables occasioned by systemic pressures such as court strike action and the chronic shortfall in judicial staffing. The plea and trial preparation hearing was initially fixed for 17 July 2025 but had to be vacated due to unforeseen absence of key witnesses and the late provision of expert material. Eventually, the matter was listed for sentence on this date, 28 August 2025. Throughout, the court has been cognisant of the impact of such delays on all parties, victims, and the public interest.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

Mr H’s digital footprint evidences a gradual radicalization process, as documented through open-source investigations and intercepted conversations. The defendant maintained several anonymous social media profiles which over time displayed increasing propagation of extremist rhetoric. Notably, the linguistic content was analysed by expert forensic linguists, who identified not only verbatim excerpts but also paraphrased material aligned with proscribed organisations’ ideological communications, thus satisfying the requisite connection to terrorism as defined under the statute.  

In addition to the aforementioned, the possession of physical items later determined to be of potential use in terrorist manufacture or attack facilitated an expanded investigation into supply chains and online marketplaces. The patterns of acquisition suggest a degree of premeditation and sophistication, indicative of the offender’s intent.  

Distracting, but concerning to the court nonetheless, is the observation of a recent spate of environmental offences in the region, namely a series of fly-tipping incidents involving hazardous waste dumped on greenbelt land on the outskirts of Bristol. Such matters, whilst unrelated to the defendant and his offending, have strained local authority resources and underscore the multifaceted nature of public safety concerns.  

The case law pertinent to the allocation and attribution of blame in joint enterprise remains well-settled. Among the authorities cited by counsel for the Crown was R v. Jogee [2016] UKSC 8, which clarified the basis for secondary liability in terrorism-related offending. While Mr H acts as the sole defendant here, it is worth noting that co-defendants in parallel proceedings have attracted significant custodial sentences consistent with the principles articulated therein.

Forensic examination of Mr H’s devices revealed an encrypted archive space containing numerous files and documents, some of which detailed the manufacture and deployment of explosive materials. The contents included instructional materials, test data, and communications with third parties whose identities remain under active investigation. The existence of partial materials, while sometimes advanced by defence as mitigating, has been adjudged by the courts as sufficient to establish intent where contextual evidence supports it (see R v. Bakar [2022] EWCA Crim 321 for relevant dicta).  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

It was suggested by the defence that some material was seized in error or was innocent in character; for example, footage depicting aerial photography purportedly tied to a hobbyist drone interest. The court, however, is resolute that, given the broader factual matrix and the timing of the acquisition of such material, a benevolent interpretation is untenable.  

The defendant’s personal circumstances have been extensively canvassed as part of mitigation. Mr H, aged 31, has an academic background in software engineering and previously held employment in data analytics. Despite this, he left his place of employment abruptly after a security clearance was revoked following an internal investigation into unauthorised access to restricted material unrelated to the present offences. Defence counsel proffered that this professional setback precipitated the defendant’s withdrawal from mainstream society and subsequent entanglement in extremism. The court accepts this as a relevant factor in understanding but not excusing the offending conduct.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Of note is a documented trip taken by Mr H to Antwerp in May 2024, ostensibly on a cultural visit. However, intelligence gathered by international law enforcement agencies indicates his attendance at a gathering where extremist ideology was promulgated and potential contacts were made with individuals later arrested on conspiracy charges for arms importation unrelated to Mr H. Whilst Mr H was not charged in connection with those activities, the court must treat such travel and associations with thorough scrutiny.  

The court is under no illusion as to the complexities facing agencies entrusted with public protection. Present day counter-terrorism units must negotiate a labyrinth of digital encryption, cross-border cooperation, and often parallel investigations into apparently tangential offences such as money laundering or document fraud to reach the evidentiary threshold required. The scale and weight of such undertakings, in all their bureaucratic entanglements, are not always obvious to the public, yet are of critical importance.  

During the course of these proceedings, legal aid arrangements required renewal on four occasions due to changes in the rules governing exceptional funding. This caused some procedural inconvenience. The court appreciates the efforts of the defence team in navigating these challenges and notes the increasingly critical discourse surrounding the funding and resourcing of legal defence in complex terrorism cases.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

A cryptocurrency analysis provided by financial investigators traced funds sent by Mr H through a series of ‘mixers’ and ‘tumblers’, ending in a wallet associated with known terror facilitation activities. The challenges posed by such financial obscuration techniques continue to vex regulators and law enforcement alike. Cryptocurrency is lauded by some as a democratizing force in finance, yet its weaponization in illicit domains necessitates a cautious and robust legal response.  

The court acknowledges the work of the Counter Terrorism Finance Unit, a specialised division that scrutinised these transactions amid competing priorities. Their input was invaluable in constructing a coherent evidential narrative.  

The notion that high-level technical expertise can be deployed for harm constitutes a grave societal concern. The defendant’s skills in software and digital security clearly enhanced his ability to evade detection and construct a layered operational plan, thereby aggravating culpability.  

A separate criminal investigation currently underway involves Mr H’s former roommate, who was recently arrested on suspicion of cannabis possession following a search unrelated to this case. There is no evidence linking the defendant to this matter, and the court records it only for completeness in illustrating the complex social milieu in which the defendant lived.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Psychiatric and psychological assessments were commissioned to evaluate Mr H’s mental state and risk profile. The report prepared by Dr Selina Moreau, consultant forensic psychiatrist, on 17 July 2025 provides a detailed analysis. Dr Moreau concluded that the defendant exhibits traits consistent with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and heightened cognitive rigidity. No major mental illness was diagnosed. The risk assessment categorises Mr H as presenting a high risk of serious harm should supervision and structured deradicalisation not be pursued post-custody.  

The report highlights the defendant’s limited insight into the consequences of his actions and his entrenched ideological worldview. Whilst noting some degree of engagement with probation interventions during remand, the report cautions against any optimistic assumptions of early desistance in the absence of comprehensive support and monitoring.  

The court also received correspondence from charitable organisations involved in community rehabilitation, including the Bristol Resettlement Trust and the Youth Engagement Forum. Whilst commendable in their aspirations, the court notes the difficulties these groups face amid funding shortfalls and staffing shortages, limiting their effectiveness in managing high-risk individuals.  

In this vein, ongoing collaboration under the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) has been instrumental in coordinating risk management strategies. The MAPPA Category 3 group supporting this case includes representatives from probation, police, health services, and local authority safeguarding teams cooperating to mitigate potential future harm.  

The court is mindful that such collaboration, though laudable in intent, often encounters institutional inertia and resource constraints. Nonetheless, the effective operation of such multi-agency frameworks remains a cornerstone of contemporary counter-terrorism public protection.  

Recent reports from the National Offender Management Service indicate heightened workload pressures among probation officers, including frequent case transfers owing to staff absences and recruitment challenges—factors which invariably affect the tempo and quality of supervision that a high-risk individual may receive.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

This defendant’s offending was not spontaneous or impulsive but part of a sustained and deliberative enterprise. The seriousness of the conduct, the clear intent to cause indiscriminate harm in public spaces, and the advanced planning required place Mr H firmly in the highest culpability bracket prescribed by the Sentencing Council’s Guidelines on Terrorism (2023). The presence of aggravating factors, including ideological motivation, technical sophistication, and the potential for substantial loss of life, further compound sentence severity.  

Mitigating factors are limited. The defendant has no previous convictions and demonstrated some belated cooperation by entering guilty pleas, albeit only at a late stage after the full weight of the case became apparent. The timing of the plea restricts the extent of credit that can be justly afforded, consistent with well-established appellate principles (R v. Haslett [2021] EWCA Crim 902; R v. Nugent [2023] EWCA Crim 1440).  

The court therefore instructs a full pre-sentence report to be prepared, with a particular focus on feasibility for a structured deradicalisation programme post-custody and consideration of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 given the ongoing risk profile. Attention should also be given to potential license conditions including electronic monitoring, exclusion zones, and mandatory engagement with psychological support services, including those accredited in structured professional judgment assessment frameworks.  

In conclusion, the court offers its thanks to Ms Denise Pritchard, counsel for the Crown, for her thorough and carefully reasoned submissions, and to Mr Daniel O’Connor, instructed via Legal Aid, whose professionalism is noted despite the administrative hurdles posed by current funding arrangements. The court also acknowledges the service of court staff, whose efforts in preparing these proceedings under heavy caseloads are deeply appreciated. The courtroom itself benefits from recent refurbishments improving security and facilities, a welcome development in the enjoyment of justice.  

These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 28 August 2025, in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Bristol. They have been duly recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the central sentencing registry and other relevant agencies.  

These are the orders of the court.
