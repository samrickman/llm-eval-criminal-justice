IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29761  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. T. FARNWORTH  
Filed: 8 September 2025  

Mr H stands before this court charged on two counts: first, an offence of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; and second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The contended conduct spanned from late March 2023 to his arrest on 17 February 2025.  

The case received its initial allocation hearing on 15 March 2025 in this venue. The court notes the high level of procedural diligence displayed, although there were, regrettably, some administrative delays attributable to staffing shortages within the Legal Aid Agency and the wider criminal justice ecosystem. Notably, the initial plea and trial preparation hearing—originally listed for 6 May 2025—was vacated upon late application by defence counsel, who sought to introduce further expert evidence. This necessitated the rescheduling of the sentencing hearing to today, 8 September 2025, a delay which, though understandable, contributed to the cumulative pressures on listed court business.  

The court is mindful that counter-terrorism prosecution is conducted under a complex matrix of statutory and procedural frameworks, including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Terrorism Acts 2000 and 2006, the Criminal Procedure Rules as amended, and relevant caselaw which has evolved over two decades. It is worth observing that cases of this nature engage simultaneously with the principles of open justice and the imperatives of national security, a dialectic that demands vigilant balancing. As Lord Wilson noted in R v. AB [2013] UKSC 55, the need for transparency must yield where the safety of the public is at risk, a principle that has guided the court’s redactions and determinations on disclosure throughout these proceedings.  

The court is grateful to Ms Fiona Lennox, prosecuting counsel, for her comprehensive opening submissions, and to Mr Oliver Trent, instructed on behalf of the defendant under the Criminal Defence Contract Scheme, for his lucid and thoughtful representations. The court also wishes to commend the court staff for their efficient handling of case materials, in particular the digital exhibit custody logs, which numbered over 480, a volume which imposed significant administrative demands within the courtroom registry.  

Prior to turning to the particulars of this case, it is apt to rehearse some procedural milestones. Mr H was arrested at home at 07:45 on 17 February 2025 under warrant issued pursuant to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, following a multi-agency intelligence operation spearheaded by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPW). The investigation—named Operation IRON TIDE—was notable for its substantial deployment of covert surveillance assets, encompassing both human and technical intelligence. The operational endeavour drew in special branch officers, forensic digital analysts from the National Cyber Crime Centre, and liaison officers from MI5. These resources, though costly, are emblematic of the state’s resolved commitment to pre-empting acts of terror through early disruption.  

Mr H has been on remand since his arrest. Prior to today’s hearing, he engaged with the court’s direction to produce psychiatric and psychological assessments to inform the sentencing exercise. The first psychiatric report, obtained under section 35 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, was prepared by Dr Harpreet Singh, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose findings are germane to the overall risk appraisal. The report is dated 23 July 2025, following a four-week inpatient assessment at Foxley Secure Unit, a medium-secure psychiatric hospital specialising in personality and ideological disorders. Dr Singh notes the complex profile of Mr H, including pervasive obsessive traits and marked cognitive rigidity, but importantly, the absence of any psychotic or mood disorder which might mitigate culpability. He further observed that Mr H’s engagement with the institution’s rehabilitative programmes was minimal and that the risk of recidivism, without stringent community management, remains appreciable.  

Notwithstanding the professional focus, it is worth remarking that health services provision in this specialty area has been severely tested by ongoing funding austerity. Waiting times for access to forensic mental health care post-custody remain distressingly long, frequently exceeding ten months, thereby limiting the timely availability of expert reports such as that obtained in this case. It is pertinent to note the tireless efforts of the Foxley clinical team, whose dedication cannot be overstated given the increasing throughput and complexity of cases.  

Turning to prosecutorial evidence, it is noteworthy that the digital forensics unit employed cutting-edge technology—including quantum decryption algorithms and layered steganographic analysis—to recover files from the defendant’s encrypted hard drives. The court acknowledges the tireless work of Ms Ruth Chandler and her team, who laboured over hundreds of hours to extract evidential material, all while contending with intermittent system downtime caused by staffing vacancies and legacy hardware failures. This underscores the perennial challenge faced by law enforcement in resourcing cyber-capacity proportionate to rising threats.

The events leading to the defendant’s arrest are embedded in a complex web of internet-mediated exchanges, accessible only through painstaking sifting of metadata traces and multi-level encryption keys. That this exercise required multiple warrants, high-security approvals, and the involvement of intelligence liaison officers from allied nations is testament to the multi-jurisdictional facets of modern terrorism investigations. It reflects the sobering reality that acts of terror are rarely localised phenomena but often interlinked elements of globalised networks.  

Throughout the investigation, concerns were raised about the defendant’s mental wellbeing, heightening the impetus for early psychiatric intervention. However, by the time of remand, his clinical presentation was consistent with high-functioning cognitive capacity and strategic evasiveness, rendering mental illness an unlikely explanation for his conduct. The court notes that other defendants under the umbrella of Operation IRON TIDE have exhibited a broader range of psychopathology, including marked paranoia and delusional ideation, but there is no evidence that Mr H’s conduct stems from such a condition.  

The court recognises that credit should be extended to the local police units who supported the counter-terrorism teams, particularly the Birmingham Central Neighbourhood Policing Group, whose officers facilitated community outreach and maintained order during the warrant execution. Such coordination is emblematic of the broader collaborative tradition within UK law enforcement.  

Turning to procedural history, the case has traversed numerous court appearances, including several case management hearings and a contested application to exclude evidence on grounds of improper surveillance. The latter was heard and dismissed by this court on 15 August 2025 after detailed argument from both prosecution and defence. The ruling upheld the admissibility of covert camera footage recorded without the defendant's knowledge, subject to operational authorisations under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

The defendant maintained a not guilty plea throughout the majority of proceedings. Only on the morning of this sentencing hearing did he enter a plea of guilty to both counts charged. The timing of this plea provides a context for the award of sentencing credit. As established in R v. Dehaney [2024] EWCA Crim 99, the degree of discount accorded to late guilty pleas must be moderated by the timing and underlying motivation of the admission. The court is mindful that Mr H’s late acceptance of responsibility, after months of trial preparation and disclosure exchange, is consistent with a tactical decision rather than early remorse. Consequently, a limited discount will be applied.  

It is instructive to refer to the guiding decisions in R v. Sedgwick [2022] EWCA Crim 804 and R v. Okoye [2023] EWCA Crim 2441, which draw a fine distinction between early plea credit and pleas entered at the cusp of trial, especially where protracted preparatory work has been done and prosecution witnesses remain scheduled to give evidence. These rulings accord with well-established common law principles that sentence reduction for guilty pleas serves the dual purpose of encouraging accountability and conserving judicial resources, but must not incentivise protracted contesting of evidence merely to engineer last-minute concessions.  

The court also acknowledges the submission of numerous character references and letters of support tendered on behalf of Mr H from various quarters—including a community arts collective, a local library association, and former colleagues from his short-lived tenure at a regional engineering consultancy. While such attestations speak to his social networks, they must be weighed against the severity of the offending conduct.  

It is pertinent to note that Mr H’s position is singular when contrasted with many defendants convicted of terrorism offences who may have histories of violent conduct or prior convictions. In this case, the defendant has no antecedent criminal record, a fact which, while not mitigating the offence, does inform the ultimate sentencing calculation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The court turns to consider the evidential materials presented by the prosecution, which include voluminous records of encrypted messaging application use, downloads of extremist publications, and quantities of dual-use materials as described in warrant inventories. The analysis of such materials, particularly those stored within nested VeraCrypt containers, necessitated the input of specialist digital investigators. The court extends its gratitude to Detective Constable Laura Mitchell, whose expert witness testimony was meticulous, clear, and unshaken under cross-examination.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

During the investigation, the defendant’s associates were also identified. One co-defendant, Mr J, remains at large following a failure to appear for trial. Mr J faces unrelated charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm arising from a confrontation in a public house, as well as possession of offensive weapons—a matter which this court notes has no bearing on Mr H’s culpability but has nonetheless led to a protracted search operation and inter-agency coordination. This ancillary activity, while outside the scope of sentencing, further exemplifies the resource-intensive nature of enforcement actions stemming from terrorism investigations.  

The court was also presented with evidence of unrelated offences committed in the defendant’s residential vicinity, including a spate of fly-tipping incidents on adjacent green-belt land and repeated instances of graffiti defacing public transport signage. While serious in their own right, these community harms have no direct nexus to the present proceedings. Their inclusion in submissions appears more pertinent to wider social order concerns than to individual culpability.  

In considering the role of mental health provision, it is salutary to recall the challenges faced by the NHS psychiatric liaison teams, who, over the past five years, have reported increasing caseloads compounded by protracted bed shortages in secure units. These systemic constraints inevitably affect the conduct and timing of assessments such as that undertaken in the present case. The court respects the delicate balance practitioners maintain between clinical impartiality and the exigencies of forensic risk evaluation.  

Furthermore, the court must comment on the channel referral pathway initiated in 2020 following concerns raised by Mr H’s college tutor, who observed his growing fixation on global conflicts and incendiary rhetoric. The referral, managed by the Birmingham Prevent Hub, resulted in a bespoke intervention plan that included cognitive-behavioural therapy and vocational training. Despite multiple engagement attempts over 18 months, the involvement remained intermittent. The court commends the Prevent Hub’s professionalism and the nuanced appreciation demonstrated in their reports. Their work, though challenging and resource-constrained, is an essential pillar of the national counter-radicalisation strategy.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The court acknowledges that no weapon was ever recovered in the defendant’s possession aside from items designed or purposed for bomb-making, the possession of which is proscribed. This technical distinction is important but does not detract from the gravity of preparing materials with the clear intention of misuse. Moreover, the detailed engineering specifications for devices found within Mr H’s encrypted archives reveal a concerning depth of knowledge and application that amplify the seriousness of his intention.  

The prosecution presented a detailed timeline highlighting a trip Mr H undertook abroad in August 2024, purportedly to attend a technology conference but which investigative authorities allege corresponded to clandestine meetings with known extremist facilitators. This trip was disrupted by visa revocation, and Mr H returned prematurely. Such circumstantial evidence, while not determinative, adds weight to the narrative of purposeful enterprise.  

It may be observed that the Criminal Justice Act 2003 empowers this court to impose extended determinate sentences where there is a significant risk of serious harm posed by the defendant to the public. The court has requested an assessment of the applicability of section 226A in this matter and will direct the production of a pre-sentence report addressing that question.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Significantly, the monetary trails include cryptocurrency transactions from wallets associated with Mr H to accounts linked to vendors specialising in chemical precursors and electronic components. The prosecution’s forensic accountant gave evidence corroborating these flows, further entrenching the finding of deliberate procurement for illicit manufacture. The court notes that while cryptocurrencies are neutral technologies, their exploitation by criminals (including terrorist actors) presents a notable challenge to enforcement. Technology, in this respect, is a double-edged sword.  

It is of some note that Mr H’s letter to the court, tendered as part of mitigation, was carefully composed, legible, and reflective—qualities that lend a measure of earnestness to his stated remorse, albeit tempered by the lateness at which acceptance has been offered.  

The court regrets the administrative frustrations expressed in correspondence regarding delays in the Legal Aid Agency’s approval of funding for independent forensic experts. Such procedural friction risks undermining the fairness of proceedings, especially where the intricacies of digital offence require specialist decipherment. This case exemplifies the pressing need for reform to expedite such authorisations and ease burdens on defence counsel.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Mr H’s background is not without complexity. Born in 1996 and brought up in a stable if modest household, he excelled academically until a period of psychological and social withdrawal marked his late teens and early twenties. His educational trajectory includes a diploma in computer science and a brief period of employment in software development. Character references describe him as socially reserved, highly intelligent, but subject to obsessive interests. There is no evidence to suggest a significant history of violent behaviour or substance misuse, other than a fleeting experiment with cannabis in his youth.  

While these personal details do not mitigate the seriousness of the offences, they do inform the sentencing exercise. The court is bound to consider the whole person and to tailor disposition in a way that fosters rehabilitation and public protection.  

Professor Helen Corrigan, forensic psychologist, whose pre-sentence assessment was submitted in draft form, identifies in Mr H a combination of rigidity in belief systems and overvalued ideation characteristic of risk-prone profiles in extremist offenders. She highlights the high likelihood of recidivism absent intensive cognitive restructuring and supervision. Treatment engagement, from her experience, is challenging but not impossible. The court awaits the final pre-sentence report for a fuller exposition.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

In conclusion, the offending before the court was both grave in ambition and extensive in preparation. The level of sophistication and planning—together with the presence of preventive measures circumvented through encrypted digital channels—places this case at the upper end of the culpability scale within the current Sentencing Council Terrorism Guidelines. The need for deterrence, public protection, and denunciation weighs heavily. In mitigation, the absence of prior convictions, the intelligent but troubled personality of the defendant, and the late plea are acknowledged.  

The court hereby directs the preparation of a full pre-sentence report by the Probation Service. That report shall address, in addition to general risk assessment, recommendations for the suitability of extended determinate sentencing, the availability of structured supervision with accredited programmes addressing extremist cognition, and engagement with Secure Accommodation or Approved Premises pending release. Representation from the West Midlands Integrated Offender Management team has been requested to assist in this process.  

Today’s sentencing remarks are issued this 8th day of September 2025 in Court 14 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The formal proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, and the defendant is advised of his right to appeal conviction and sentence within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
