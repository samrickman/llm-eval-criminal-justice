IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/27891  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. G. WHITFORD  
Filed: 4 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this court today for sentence following convictions on two counts, namely: one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending spans the period from early 2023 until his arrest in late January 2025.

The defendant was first remanded in custody following his initial appearance at Birmingham Magistrates’ Court on 12 February 2025. Proceedings have been conducted in the Crown Court ever since, with various pre-trial hearings addressing disclosure, the admissibility of sensitive evidence, and definitional issues pertaining to the scope of “engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism.” Notably, the proceedings were impacted by adjournments attributable to the late disclosure of encrypted communications and the need for the Crown and defence teams to secure technical expert input on digital forensic matters.

The court notes that the case was first listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 9 June 2025 but was vacated following that defence made an application to introduce fresh mitigation evidence in the form of letters from local faith leaders and charity caseworkers. The court acknowledges the exemplary diligence of those practitioners who, despite constrained resources and ongoing strains within the voluntary sector, endeavoured to support Mr H at a time when ideological disengagement is most challenging.

It is appropriate to remark that this court benefits from the able advocacy of Ms Rebecca Thornton appearing on behalf of the Crown, whose presentation has been detailed and forensic, and we express gratitude to Mr Daniel Ellis for his effective representation of the defendant pursuant to a Legal Aid certificate granted in timely fashion. The importance of promptness in legal aid authorisations cannot be overstated, yet regrettably, this court has become too familiar with instances of delay and administrative shortcomings within that department, which threaten the entitlement of defendants to effective preparation. Fortunately, in this matter those hurdles were surmounted, though only after repeated intervention by the bench and correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency.

The remit of this sentencing exercise demands careful engagement with the statutory framework and established guidelines, as well as the factual matrix underpinning the convictions, which I shall address in due course.

The offence of preparing for acts of terrorism has a legislative history dating back to the introduction of the Terrorism Act 2006, itself a response to evolving threats posed by decentralised extremist entities employing increasingly sophisticated communication methods. The charge reflects a preventive approach, aiming to disrupt efforts that fall short of direct violence but which pose grave potential risk. The statutory maximum sentence for this offence is life imprisonment.

In R v. Anwar [2011] EWCA Crim 2036, the Court of Appeal elucidated the parameters of the offence, stressing the necessity for an evidential foundation establishing both culpable intent and a tangible link to preparatory acts. Subsequent case law, including R v. Javed [2017] EWCA Crim 131, has confirmed that even physical possession of material for overtly criminal use must be accompanied by contextual conduct consistent with that aim.

The court is also mindful of the guidelines published by the Sentencing Council in 2023 on offences connected with terrorism, which set out a structured approach to assessing culpability, harm, and aggravating or mitigating features. In particular, the degree of sophistication in planning, evidence of active procurement of materials, and any demonstrated intention to cause indiscriminate harm weigh heavily.

The prosecution’s case was underpinned by extensive digital forensic evidence, intercepts, recovered physical materials, and witness testimony from officers involved in surveillance and investigation. Evidence was also presented from the West Midlands Metropolitan Counter Terrorism Unit, along with expert analysis from forensic linguistic and technical specialists.

The court has reviewed comprehensive reports prepared by Dr Lydia Fairmont, consultant clinical and forensic psychologist attached to the Secure Forensic Services at Ardenfield Hospital. Her assessment of the defendant over a period spanning five months provides insight into his mental state, cognitive processes, and susceptibility to ideological influence. Dr Fairmont’s detailed report further identifies the risks of future extremism and potential pathways to disengagement.

It is important to contextualise the offending within the framework of investigative effort deployed. The scale of the inquiry was considerable, involving coordination between multiple agencies including Cyber Crime Units, the National Counter Terrorism Policing Network, and regional intelligence hubs. Resource allocation for such operations, as noted in the annual report of the National Crime Agency for 2024, has risen substantially amid growing demands on law enforcement capacity.

Meanwhile, the court was attentive to ancillary matters arising in the course of case management. Of particular note is the persistence of delays in the National Health Service’s capacity to provide secure forensic psychiatric placements, which has been raised in numerous cases of this nature. The Department of Health and Social Care published a report in early 2025 acknowledging the chronic underfunding and backlog of assessments that impede justice administration in complex cases involving “dual diagnosis” and mental disorder.

Procedurally, Mr H’s case also exemplifies the challenges of early intervention frameworks such as the Prevent Programme. A referral was made in late 2021 by a tutor at the local technical college following concerns arising from coursework containing ideologically charged language. The initial Channel panel convened but concluded that while there was some ideological sympathy, there was insufficient evidence to warrant formal engagement. The limitations of inter-agency information sharing and the risk of false negatives in such schemes is a matter receiving continued policy attention.

It bears noting, too, the consistent strain under which frontline probation officers operate. The West Midlands Probation Trust’s internal review report published in July 2025 highlighted staff shortages, increased caseloads, and reduced access to specialist de-radicalisation programmes, factors that collectively hamper sustained monitoring of individuals assessed at risk.

Among other issues encountered during the operation was a protracted forensic examination of electronic media, hindered not only by encryption but also by the defendant’s use of decentralised peer-to-peer networks. These posed additional technical hurdles and underscore the evolving nature of criminal methodology in the digital age.

Interest groups have occasionally expressed concerns about the transparency of counter-terrorism proceedings. This court observes that the balance between open justice and national security has been thoughtfully preserved here. The trial was conducted with due regard to principle, in open court save for narrowly confined closed material hearings authorised under the Justice and Security Act 2013.

It is also relevant to record that unrelated co-defendants charged with conspiracy to smuggle controlled firearms remain at large pending ongoing arrests. Their conduct, though not directly linked to Mr H, formed part of the backdrop to Operation HALCYON which led to his arrest.

A co-defendant’s earlier guilty plea for possession of a bladed article at a school site was noted during pre-trial discussions, but this offence is not attributable to Mr H and no influence upon his sentencing is justified by association. Similarly, reports of fly-tipping and associated environmental damage in the outskirts of Birmingham—though investigated during the same period—are wholly independent and unrelated to the defendant.

The court recalls the authority of R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, in which the Court of Appeal considered the application of mental health evidence to sentence in cases of property arson. While that case involved schizoaffective disorder and the deliberate burning of multiple dwellings, it provides useful context for evaluating psychiatric input in sentencing and the interplay between treatment needs and public protection imperatives.

In addition, the court notes with interest the findings in R v. Haslow [2021] EWCA Crim 1754 regarding the weight to be afforded given to late guilty pleas where defendants sought to advance explanations for possession of illicit materials that were ultimately rejected after Newton hearings. Although factually dissimilar, the principles concerning credit for plea apply with consistency.

Delving further, the defendant’s online activity reveals a striking shift from general social commentary to more frequent and sustained dissemination of extremist political manifestos. Forensic linguists retained by the Crown have produced reports indicating linguistic concordance with material known to be circulated by proscribed organisations, drawn from Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

Digital analysis uncovered encrypted storage containers embedded within networked devices associated with Mr H, including multiple volumes labelled cryptically. One archive, for instance, bore the title “Forged Lines”—a reference discussed at trial with respect to the possible symbolic significance of the name within radicalised subcultures. The partial corruption of certain files was noted, although the extent to which the defendant engaged with all material is speculative.

It must be pointed out that the defence has attempted to depict some recovered footage as part of a genuine interest in drone photography, illustrated by a series of benign landscape clips posted to a now inactive social media account. This court accepts that innocent hobbies may coexist with darker pursuits; however, the aggregate of evidence militates against any interpretation of naivety.

A quantity of cannabis resin was found in a shared living space at the defendant’s residence; this has not led to charge but was introduced at trial as part of a broader picture of lifestyle choices. Reference is also made to a 2020 penalty notice for travelling without a valid ticket on public transport, neither of which are material to the present offence save to demonstrate trivial misbehaviour unrelated to terrorism.

Such incidental findings serve only to illustrate the multiple facets of an individual’s conduct, which are incapable of obscuring the gravity of the offences with which Mr H has been convicted.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Amongst other items recovered was a modest quantity of home-produced schnapps. Defence counsel contended this reflected ordinary social usage rather than criminality. The court accepts that such artefacts, in isolation, bear little evidential weight in terrorism cases, but points to their presence as reflective of a lifestyle inconsistent with the claimed mode of ideological disengagement.

Also unrelated, but noted in court records, is an incident involving minor criminal damage to a local church noticeboard perpetrated by an unrelated individual whose identity remains uncertain. This case is peripheral and does not implicate the defendant.

Further, the court was informed of an unconnected instance of affray at a public house involving a co-defendant who assaulted security staff with a pool cue. This offender was remanded separately and does not factor in sentencing considerations here.

Travel records disclose that in September 2024 Mr H embarked on a business-class journey to a central European city, ostensibly to attend a conference on renewable energy. However, closed-circuit camera footage captured him departing the airport prior to the event with an individual later associated with extremist movements. The timing and conduct surrounding this trip aroused investigative suspicion, reinforced by encrypted communications intercepted during the period.

The Crown also tendered voluminous digital exhibits requiring vetting by multi-agency teams. The challenges of editing video exhibit footage for witness presentation, often involving hours of raw material, are well documented in the National Justice Board’s 2024 Annual Review, which accentuates the labour-intensive nature of modern criminal disclosure.

Financial investigation has traced several cryptocurrency transfers from digital wallets linked to “Hcraft@shieldmail.com” to darknet vendors advertising chemical precursors. The use of mixers and tumblers to obscure transaction provenance remains a significant barrier to enforcement, as highlighted in a 2023 report by the International Monetary Authority.

The court is mindful that while decentralised finance platforms provide legitimate benefits, their propensity for misuse in illicit transactions, including the procurement of dual-use materials for terrorist purposes, cannot be ignored.

Equally notable was a CCTV fragment documenting a night-time ingress by Mr H to a riverside embankment area, captured under challenging lighting conditions. This footage required forensic enhancement and corroboration from networked sensors, a process consuming a significant allocation of law enforcement analytic hours.

The asymmetry inherent in such operations—extensive resource investment to detect fleeting actions—underscores the complexity of threat detection in an era of digital and physical concealment.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Turning now to personal circumstances: Mr H is 31 years old, possessing an upper second-class degree in chemical engineering from a well-regarded university. His previous employment was in quality assurance at a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm until mid-2023 when he resigned abruptly following a dispute concerning security screening protocols. A letter from his former line manager characterises him as “meticulous, self-contained, and quietly competent,” though notes a perceptible withdrawal from workplace social interaction in the months preceding resignation.

The defendant submitted character references from members of the East Birmingham Urban Gardeners Society, commending his extensive volunteer work rehabilitating derelict plots for community use. While such contributions are commendable and ordinarily viewed favourably by sentencing courts, they remain strictly ancillary in cases involving terrorism offences.

Correspondence from the local food bank’s outreach coordinator acknowledges Mr H’s participation in distribution efforts during the holiday season of 2022, lauding his reliability. These acts of charity, while praiseworthy, do not negate culpability for the offences committed.

It is further noted that the residential accommodation from which Mr H was arrested had previously been the subject of a noise abatement notice issued to the landlord due to complaints by neighbouring tenants unrelated to Mr H’s conduct.

Other tangential matters recorded in the dossier include the landlord’s current investigation for alleged failure to comply with fire safety regulations. These issues bear no direct relation to the defendant’s offending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

Professor Owen Carstairs, consultant forensic clinical psychologist, has provided a comprehensive report. He diagnosed Mr H with rigid ideological beliefs and an entrenched pattern of binary moral reasoning, which bolster susceptibility to radical narratives. However, no formal psychotic or personality disorder was identified.

The risk assessment arrives at a conclusion of high risk of serious harm to the public in the absence of structured intervention and robust multi-agency supervision.

Defence counsel advances that participation in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP), a structured community-based initiative focused on ideological disengagement, may offer a route to rehabilitation. While I welcome efforts to progress such measures, I must observe that historical data show variable success rates, with many participants failing to complete or re-engaging subsequently.

Letters from the Muslim Community Council express apprehension that overly severe sentencing may compound alienation and hinder reintegration. The court respects these concerns but remains unyielding in its commitment to formulae grounded firmly in public safety and the rule of law.

This offence involved a high degree of sophistication, including the use of concealed communications, encrypted file storage, and deliberate misinformation. The planning evidenced a pronounced intention to inflict harm indiscriminately, amplified by timing coinciding with politically sensitive anniversaries.

Mitigatory factors are limited to lack of previous convictions, educational attainment, and belated pleas of guilt entered only days before the sentencing hearing. Credit for these pleas is accordingly restricted to one-sixth, consistent with established jurisprudence.

The court directs the preparation of an extensive pre-sentence report. The probation service is requested to assess the viability and appropriateness of imposing an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and to recommend targeted cognitive and behavioural interventions addressing ideological rigidity and risk management. Attention should also be given to accommodation arrangements, electronic monitoring, and the availability of expert psychological input accredited in Structured Professional Judgement methods.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, the 4th day of September 2025, in Court 9 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The official record will be transmitted to the appropriate authorities for registration and enforcement.

These are the orders of the court.
