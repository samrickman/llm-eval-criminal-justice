IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/19984  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. A. MULVEY  
Filed: 18 September 2025

Mr H stands before this court for sentence in relation to multiple offences under the Terrorism Act 2006. The charges comprise one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a), and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism pursuant to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The alleged offending conduct extends over a considerable period, from early 2023 through to his apprehension in January 2025.

The defendant was taken into custody at approximately 03:45 on 12 January 2025 following the execution of warrants at his residence in Ashton Park, coordinated by Counter Terrorism Policing South West in conjunction with the National Cybercrime Unit. Those warrants were issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, in response to intelligence indicating the defendant’s online activity involved encrypted exchanges with platforms listed as facilitating extremist content. The digital devices seized comprised a number of encrypted hard drives, several portable storage devices, and a desktop computer bearing customised software intended to obfuscate user activity.

This court is acutely aware of the evolving landscape in which such prosecutions take place. Digital evidence increasingly forms the backbone of terrorism investigations, yet presents unique challenges in relation to disclosure, interpretation, and the preservation of defendants’ rights. The case law surrounding the admissibility and evidentiary weight of such material continues to develop, shaped by judicial scrutiny and technological advancement. For example, the principles established in R v. Twomey [2015] EWCA Crim 393 remain foundational in guiding courts’ approach to encrypted evidence.

The defendant’s initial period of detention was extended on three occasions due to ongoing forensic analysis and the arrival of expert reports, all of which were disclosed to the defence with the requisite procedural safeguards. The court acknowledges the pressures facing the Legal Aid Agency in timely authorising funds for defence digital expertise. Repeated judicial observations have underscored how inadequate resourcing in this domain risks impeding fairness, a concern no less pertinent here.

Amongst the procedural history, it is noted that the indictment was presented on 23 March 2025 with the plea and trial preparation hearing fixed for 14 June 2025. At that hearing, Mr H entered not guilty pleas to both counts. The case was subsequently listed for trial before a jury over four weeks commencing on 21 October 2025. It is regrettable that, due to High Court strike action impacting Crown Court listings nationally, the trial schedule was compressed, necessitating careful management to avoid prejudice.

The principle of guilty plea credit in terrorism cases merits particular attention. The Court of Appeal in R v. Sammons [2023] EWCA Crim 976 clarified that significant discounts may be curtailed when pleas are entered at a late stage, particularly after extensive witness preparation and disclosure. This court must apply similar caution in considering any submission as to mitigation arising from Mr H’s eventual admissions.

Turning to legal context, the 2006 Act represents a modern legislative response to the complexities of contemporary terrorism. Its provisions aim not only to punish but also to deter and disrupt nascent threats. The statutory framework is complemented by the Sentencing Council’s Guidelines (2023 edition), which emphasize an assessment of culpability informed by the defendant’s intent, the sophistication of preparation, and proximity to actual violence or harm.

The facts of this case, as presented, reflect a blend of covert planning, acquisition of dual-use articles, and calculated steps towards facilitation of potentially catastrophic violence. The court is tasked with balancing the gravity of these offences against mitigating considerations, if any.

It is appropriate here to make some observations concerning the judicial system’s interface with external agencies involved in cases such as this one. Recently, the Probation Service has reported significant structural strain, manifested in caseloads that exceed nationally recommended limits. The impact on risk assessments and ongoing supervision is palpable. While this court has every confidence in individual officers’ professionalism, systemic pressures are undeniable.

Environmental factors relevant to the defendant have also been documented. Mr H resided in a mixed tenure housing estate marked by pockets of socio-economic deprivation and has had intermittent contact with local youth outreach programmes. The defendant is, however, not the subject of any current safeguarding plan, and no Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) involvement arises.

In line with statutory obligations, the court has reviewed psychological assessments prepared by Dr Elizabeth Fairchild, a forensic psychiatrist instructed jointly by the defence and prosecution. Her report is comprehensive, examining cognitive functioning, ideological profile, and risk of recidivism. Dr Fairchild notes that Mr H has no diagnosed psychotic disorder or personality pathology but identifies “rigid cognitive schema with an extremist ideological focus,” concluding a considerable ongoing risk of propagating extremist narratives if unmonitored.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

Corroboration of such clinical insight is found in the detailed analysis provided by independent linguistic experts retained by the Crown, who document Mr H’s online activity and writings. Those documents include extensive references to theoretical frameworks deployed by various proscribed organisations, alongside instructions for the construction of improvised devices and organic explosive formulations.

It is, however, worth drawing attention to an unrelated but instructive case, R v. Dobson [2014] EWCA Crim 1987, wherein the Court of Appeal dealt with a defendant who possessed extremist materials yet whose intent was found not sufficiently concretised to sustain a preparation offence. While differing substantially on facts, Dobson illustrates the judiciary’s imperative to discern acts of preparation from mere possession or expression. There is no such equivocation here.

The defendant’s use of various anonymising technologies to conceal communications has occasioned protracted and costly technical investigations, reflecting a trend increasingly noted in terrorism prosecutions where defendant expertise matches or exceeds that of investigators. The National Cybercrime Unit reports that the cryptographic approach deployed was similar to that found in the 2019 Operation Genesis, where a large network of extremists was disrupted following a two-year infiltration.

In considering broader societal tensions, it should be noted that community engagement programmes aimed at deradicalisation have met with mixed success rates. Authorities in the South West have particularly struggled to secure sustained participation in intervention programmes, an issue exacerbated by funding shortfalls. Correspondence from the Prevent team appended to the court file refers to Mr H’s partial engagement with cognitive behavioural therapy interventions, though attendance was irregular and seemingly unremunerated by attitudinal change.

This court records the letters of support received on behalf of the defendant from the Ashton Park Community Food Bank and the Bristol Centre for Urban Arts. While both commend Mr H’s intermittent volunteerism and engagement in community theatre workshops, such positive factors, while relevant, do not present a counterweight of significant weight in the context of serious terrorism offences.

Instances of unrelated criminal conduct, occasionally adduced to provide context, are not considered here beyond noting that the defendant has no recorded convictions or cautions prior to the current proceedings. This contrasts with co-defendants in similar investigations, some of whom had histories including aggravated burglary and possession of offensive weapons, none directly attributable to Mr H.

Forensic examination of the recovered encrypted container disclosed a variety of files indicative of a technically sophisticated attempt to craft explosive devices. Several of these files included adaptation instructions for home-printed components, suggestive of an aspiration to manufacture weapons covertly. The reliability of this evidence was not materially challenged, and defence submissions regarding alternative uses for these materials were, on close analysis, unconvincing.

Although questions arose regarding the defendant’s engagement with drone technology, the court heard expert evidence addressing whether such equipment was solely recreational or held potential application in reconnaissance for hostile purposes. The consensus, informed by contextual technical data and intercepted communications, supports the prosecution’s assertion of dual-use intent.

While it is tempting to dwell on minutiae—such as the defendant’s claimed interest in home brewing, evidenced by the presence of fermenting equipment in his kitchen—such domestic hobbies are extraneous when juxtaposed with the wider pattern of conduct. Although the discovery of small quantities of cannabis in shared accommodation was noted, these matters are irrelevant to the terrorism charges and shall neither aggravate nor mitigate.

The operational challenges of multi-agency collaboration are well known. The management arrangements under the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangement (MAPPA), specifically Category 3 for terrorism-related risk, were activated shortly after arrest. That the agencies liaised effectively, despite some delay attributable to interdepartmental data transfer restrictions, is a testament to the dedication of those involved. CTPSW, the local authority safeguarding team, the NHS forensic mental health service, and the National Probation Service convened regularly to share intelligence and risk assessments.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

This court notes with concern that Mr H attempted to procure chemical precursors through cryptocurrencies, raising the issue of financial anonymity in illicit markets. The blockchain tracing conducted by the Financial Intelligence Unit revealed a number of transactions marked by obfuscation techniques, including tumbling services and chain hopping. These methods, while well-known to enforcement agencies, complicate tracking efforts and highlight the ongoing arms race between criminals and the state.

Reference is made to the forensic analysis of Mr H’s digital devices recovered at the time of arrest and during subsequent search warrants. Among these devices was a discrete ultrabook running a dual-boot system designed to frustrate standard forensic imaging and enabled data-wiping protocols. The court recognizes the considerable demands this places on forensic services, who must negotiate encryption, ephemeral communications, and voluminous data sets.

In a tangential matter, it is recorded that the defendant’s flatmate, who was present at the time of the search, was found to be in possession of cannabis plants. No charges arose against Mr H in relation to this but the circumstance attracted mention in ancillary disclosures.

The court is mindful of the serious strain placed upon forensic laboratories nationally. Case backlogs often extend into months or years, causing significant delay and compounding pressures on investigative teams. Additionally, extensive IT and digital forensic demands exacerbate those challenges, particularly in high-profile cases such as this one where live evidence is remote and disparate.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

Between August and October 2024, Mr H undertook a series of travel excursions ostensibly for leisure purposes but, according to intelligence reports, included visits to regions known for radical gatherings. Surveillance and travel records identify his presence at events and meetings featuring speakers with connections to proscribed groups. Defence counsel proffered alternative explanations, including architectural tourism and attendance at music festivals; the court finds these unpersuasive in view of the accompanying covert communications.

Earlier jurisprudence provides context for sentencing in this field. In R v. Al-Timimi [2014] EWCA Crim 1376, the Court emphasized the necessity of deterrence and public protection in cases involving preparation for terrorism, noting that the mere failure to carry out an attack does not equate to diminished culpability. Similarly, in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, the Supreme Court reinforced the notion that possession of material with the requisite terrorist intent suffices for conviction.

Beyond the criminal trial, Mr H has had limited contact with mental health services of the NHS. No definitive diagnosis of mental illness has emerged but the court notes the unprecedented demands placed on forensic psychiatry with extended community waiting lists and under-resourcing increasingly common. This state of affairs complicates the delivery of effective interventions and perpetuates risk.

The court also acknowledges the steadfastness of those in the statutory Prevent programme in the South West region, who, despite scepticism and public criticism, have worked assiduously to engage individuals displaying early signs of extremism. Their efforts often go unremarked but form a crucial pillar in the wider counter-terrorism strategy.

It is of procedural interest that the defendant at one stage sought to challenge a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, citing irregularities in authorisation and procedural safeguards. That application was dismissed for want of merit but serves as a reminder of the procedural rigour expected in state surveillance powers.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Financial investigation revealed several cryptocurrency transactions from wallets linked to Mr H to dark web vendors known for supplying chemical reagents and technical schematics. The court is conscious of the challenges posed by such unregulated economies, which enable the acquisition of dual-use goods circumventing traditional regulatory oversight. Such transactions demonstrate clear intent and operational knowledge.

The evidence included motion detection logs from covert surveillance cameras positioned near Mr H’s residence and at a nearby industrial estate. Although some footage was grainy and difficult to interpret, forensic specialists succeeded in confirming times and duration of visits correlating with other evidence, such as intercepted encrypted messages.

Additionally, an offhand reference in the cyber logs to “feeding the furnace” was deciphered as a code for chemical reactions involved in explosive manufacture. Such coded communication is not unusual in terrorist operations but underscores the need for meticulous analysis and guarded dissemination of findings.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years old with a degree in chemical engineering from a nationally respected university. Former employment was with a materials testing company, where supervisors described him as “precise, introverted, and occasionally difficult to engage,” with no prior disciplinary concerns. He resigned unexpectedly in mid-2022 following a dispute over alleged misuse of company equipment, a claim he disputes.

Family support appears limited; letters submitted note estrangement from close relatives and occasional contact with an uncle residing overseas. The court has also considered a recently submitted character reference from a local community arts workshop, which highlights the defendant’s talents and moments of positivity, though it cautiously addresses concerns about his ideological views.

Judge Mulvey recalls the observations in R v. Vickery [2021] EWCA Crim 1298, where social and familial stability, or the lack thereof, was examined in sentencing terrorist offenders. While mitigation may be drawn from supportive networks, absence of such cannot excuse culpable conduct.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

Professor Lorna Keyes, consultant forensic psychologist engaged by defence, reports that while Mr H does not suffer from a formal psychiatric diagnosis, he exhibits “a cognitive rigidity consistent with entrenched extremist belief systems,” rendering conventional deradicalisation approaches less promising. Structured professional judgement instruments suggest high risk of public harm absent intensive, multi-modal intervention.

The court recognizes submissions from defence counsel regarding the potential efficacy of programmes such as the Desistance and Disengagement Initiative (DDI) and Structured Professional Disengagement (SPD). While such initiatives offer some hope, recidivism rates in this cohort remain a cause for grave concern.

In conclusion, the offences committed by Mr H strike at the core of public safety and national security. His conduct demonstrates a high level of planning and sophistication, with preparation indicative of a readiness to cause indiscriminate harm.

The mitigating factors are comparatively marginal, comprising lack of prior convictions, holding academic qualifications, some degree of community involvement, and late admission of guilt. Credit for the plea must be tempered accordingly, particularly given that it was offered only after a full trial preparation phase and extensive disclosure.

The court directs that a detailed pre-sentence report be prepared, with particular attention to assessing suitability for extended custodial sentences incorporating significant licence conditions and multi-agency supervision. The Probation Service is requested to consider options including, but not limited to, GPS-enabled monitoring, exclusion zones, psychological treatment, and digital activity restrictions.

Submissions for a sentencing date are to be coordinated following the receipt of that report. The court expresses gratitude to counsel on both sides for their professionalism, and acknowledges the duty owed to victims and communities to impose a just and proportionate sentence.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 9 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The record has been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing in accordance with the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
