IN THE CROWN COURT AT NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. N2025/35791  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. S. ALEXANDER  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges brought pursuant to the Terrorism Act 2006. The indictment comprises two counts: one count under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely, engaging in conduct in preparation of an act of terrorism; and one count under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, that is, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism. The alleged conduct underlying these counts is said to have taken place over an extended period, commencing mid-2022 and continuing until the defendant’s arrest in January 2025.

The defendant’s arrest was effected at approximately 04:45 hours on 22 January 2025 following the execution of a jointly coordinated search warrant at a residential property in the Fenham district of Newcastle. The warrant was authorised by a district judge pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 upon satisfactory evidence from Counter Terrorism Policing North East and with the cooperation of the Security Service. This operation was the culmination of a lengthy and resource-intensive investigation designated Operation Northgate, which drew on a cross-section of investigative methods including covert surveillance, human intelligence reports, digital forensics, and pattern-of-life analysis. It is important to remind ourselves that such investigations place substantial operational burdens on agencies already stretched thin—not only financially but in manpower and technical expertise.

The defendant was initially remanded in custody following a hearing before District Judge Rennard at Newcastle Magistrates’ Court on 23 January 2025. A plea and trial preparation hearing convened on 14 May 2025 was notable for the defendant’s continued not guilty pleas at that time. Notwithstanding the vigorous nature of the defence oral submissions, an application was granted to extend the time for disclosure of sensitive material connected to encrypted communications recovered from the defendant’s electronic devices, prolonging pre-trial processes. The trial was duly listed before this court for 12 August 2025 and proceeded over nine days, concluding on 22 August 2025 with the jury returning unanimous guilty verdicts on both counts.

The court acknowledges the diligence of counsel during those proceedings. Ms Jennifer Baillie appeared for the Crown with her customary attention to detail and poise, whilst Mr Christopher Vaughan represented the defendant with an unwavering commitment to advocacy despite the challenges presented by voluminous technical material. The court is mindful that cases classified within the terrorism jurisdiction invariably impose unusual strains on counsel teams, witness protection services, and court administration alike due to their complexity and sensitivity.

It is appropriate here to address, with the usual caveats, the longstanding jurisprudential framework that governs credit for guilty pleas in this jurisdiction. The Criminal Procedure Rules Part 25 expressly provide that the timing of a plea is a relevant consideration in sentencing. As appears from the judgments in R v. Collingridge [2022] EWCA Crim 1873 and R v. Tinsley [2023] EWCA Crim 1401, the courts have held that early pleas not only conserve precious court resources but also carry an implicit demonstration of remorse and acceptance of responsibility. Conversely, pleas tendered at a late stage—particularly after the prosecution has expended considerable preparatory work—cannot be accorded the same level of mitigation.

In reflecting upon the submissions of the defence and those of the Crown, the court notes that the events giving rise to conviction are steeped in technical sophistication and ideological zealotry. The defendant’s use of multiple layers of encryption and the adoption of virtual private networks to mask IP addresses demonstrates a concerted attempt to evade detection. The jury heard evidence that Mr H maintained communications with individuals affiliated with a proscribed organisation, identified by the Security Service as extremist in purpose and methodology. This underscores a level of commitment which, in the sentencing framework set out by the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines, would place the defendant towards the more culpable end of the spectrum.

The court was provided with an extensive psychiatric report prepared by Dr. Evelyn M. Colbourne, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, who conducted interviews with Mr H over several sessions in custody. Dr Colbourne’s analysis described the defendant as presenting traits consistent with rigid ideological belief, marked by an “adherence to absolutist frameworks” and a “cognitive inflexibility” which severely limit the prospects of prompt disengagement absent prolonged and intensive intervention. Notably, no formal mental health disorder was diagnosed, and indeed mental illness does not form part of the defence or mitigating submissions. Dr Colbourne expressed concern, however, regarding the enduring risk Mr H poses to the public if released without robust risk management frameworks in place.

It is regrettable that, at the plea and trial preparation hearing in May, no indication was given of any willingness to plead guilty, thus prolonging litigation. This was despite the prosecution’s disclosure of compelling digital evidence, forensic hashes linking encrypted devices to extremist content, and witness statements confirming communications concerning the acquisition of dual-use materials. Such a posture on the part of the defence is by now a familiar yet disheartening feature of many terrorism prosecutions, as noted in R v. Haslett [2021] EWCA Crim 902 and R v. Ellison [2022] EWCA Crim 1176, particularly where devices recovered show meticulous operational security but also the defendant’s unwillingness to cooperate until the evidence is overwhelming.

However, it merits acknowledgement that defence counsel persistently sought to explore the possibility of challenging the admissibility of certain digital items on grounds of proportionality and relevance, citing the principles enunciated in R v. AB [2014] EWCA Crim 354 and the recent Supreme Court judgment in R v. Yusuf [2023] UKSC 15, which underscores the importance of balancing national security interests with responsibilities to the accused. The court appreciates the fine line counsel must walk between zealous representation and safeguarding the efficient functioning of the criminal justice system, a matter of ever-present difficulty in terrorism trials.

As appears from the trial transcript, special attention was given to the defendant’s online footprint—namely a blog platform he maintained covertly under an alias. Linguistic experts from the National Centre for Extremism Research provided analysis indicating substantial verbatim borrowings from a 2011 manifesto associated with a foreign terrorist organisation. This was coupled with the recovery of electronic documents illustrating design specifications for improvised explosive devices, notably in encrypted folders titled “Kitsune” and “Helix.” Expert witnesses testified about the possible lethality and indiscriminate nature of the designs, assessing them as capable of mass casualties in densely populated settings.

This case brought the court into contact with the difficult reality of modern multi-agency cooperation. The MAPPA process was invoked early on, triggering a Category 3 review which included representatives from the Probation Service, the NHS Secure Psychological Unit, Counter Terrorism Policing North East, and the Local Authority’s Safeguarding Team. Though the defendant’s initial unwillingness to engage with voluntary deradicalisation schemes hampered immediate progress, the court nonetheless acknowledges the tireless efforts of dedicated professionals who continue to monitor and manage risk post-conviction. Such engagement operates within a broader environment of stretched capacity, increasing caseloads, and resource constraints—conditions well-documented in the HM Inspectorate of Probation’s 2024 report on Extremism Risk Management.

The Probation Service’s pre-sentence report, when received, shall address possible pathways for intervention, including enrolment in cognitive-behavioural programmes specifically tailored to ideological offenders, and consider accommodation needs given Mr H’s pending custodial sentence. The probation officer has also highlighted the challenges posed by housing shortages and the insufficient availability of approved premises with appropriate security classification, a dilemma experienced nationally and reflected in government statistics published earlier this year.

The court also had before it submissions from charitable organisations operating in the Newcastle area. Letters from the Northumberland Resettlement Group and the Newcastle Community Integration Trust offered cautious support, acknowledging the defendant’s sporadic voluntary engagement with mentoring initiatives predating arrest by some six months. These letters emphasise both the limitations of voluntary programmes when ideological commitment remains steadfast and the potential value of structured supervision paired with psychological support. This court commends these organisations for continuing to operate under considerable fiscal uncertainty and societal scepticism.

In an unrelated, though peripherally informative vein, the court recalls the sentencing remarks delivered in R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, which involved a defendant with schizoaffective disorder who ignited multiple fires causing property damage and risk to life. While the facts in Mallory concern a substantially different type of offence, the principles articulated regarding balancing therapeutic intervention with custodial measures remain relevant as contextual benchmarks in the wider arena of sentencing offenders with complex mental and behavioural issues.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

A further consideration for the court is the defendant’s prior history. Mr H has no known convictions relating to violent or extremist activity before these proceedings. That said, the court notes from the Presentence Report that in 2019 he was cautioned for a separate matter of shoplifting alcohol and toiletry items from a supermarket in Hexham. While relatively minor and unrelated to the instant offences, this caution forms part of the defendant’s background. There is no evidence suggesting that event bore a connection to ideology or political belief. Such detours in an individual's journey can sometimes reflect social stressors rather than entrenched criminal intent.

Moreover, Mr H’s homelessness two years prior to his arrest, involving brief periods of rough sleeping documented in council housing records and supported by referrals to local outreach teams, illustrates the complex social circumstances that often intersect with pathways to radicalisation. While these factors do not excuse or diminish responsibility for terrorist conduct, they provide important context for consideration in determining appropriate custodial and post-custodial measures.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Prevailing concerns about public safety inform the court’s cautious approach to sentencing. Expert risk assessments, including the views expressed by Professor Leonard Hargreaves, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, underscore Mr H’s proclivity towards “black-and-white thinking” and an absence of empathy for potential collateral harm. Other psychological characteristics outlined include “resistance to cognitive reframing interventions” and “a heightened threat sensitivity” likely to result in defensive radicalisation if exposed to peer influences promoting conspiracy narratives.

An additional factor relevant to public safety is the complexity and novelty of the defendant’s communication methods. Forensic examination disclosed an elaborate array of virtual machines running isolated operating systems on encrypted external drives. Such technical arrangements go beyond rudimentary attempts at concealment and illustrate a significant investment of time and skill. They also present ongoing challenges for law enforcement surveillance post-release, should the court consider a determinate sentence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

The court, mindful of the Sentencing Council Guidelines, particularly paragraph 4.23, directs that high culpability factors include deliberate targeting of civilian populations, detailed preparatory acts demonstrating clear intent, and efforts at operational security such as encryption and obfuscation. The defendant’s conduct satisfies these criteria manifestly. 

Mitigation is limited. Mr H has no previous convictions for terrorism or violent offences, has a first-class degree in computer science, and submitted a belated guilty plea on the first day of trial, which merits some recognition though substantially attenuated by timing.

In considering sentence, the court notes the necessity to impose a sentence which reflects the gravity of offending, the need for deterrence, and paramountly, the protection of the public. The defendant poses a continuing risk necessitating supervision levels that will test existing MAPPA arrangements and probation capacity.

Given all the foregoing, the court will adjourn sentencing to enable the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. Particular emphasis shall be directed towards the suitability of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the feasibility of GPS monitoring, and inclusion of polygraph testing as part of licence conditions. The report should also canvass the availability of high-intensity psychological intervention consistent with the Structured Professional Judgement framework widely employed in counter-terrorism contexts.

The court thanks those involved in the thorough preparation of this matter. It notes the commendable yet taxing efforts of digital forensic analysts, whose expertise allowed for recovery of data notwithstanding the defendant’s deliberate attempts at erasure and obfuscation—work that consumed hundreds of investigatory hours and relied upon international cooperation between law enforcement agencies.

It must also be recorded that the proceedings were conducted without interruption or significant delay, despite an intervening regional court staff strike. The venue’s recently installed enhanced digital recording system functioned without defect and the court’s judiciary staff and ushers maintained orderly conduct throughout.

On behalf of the court, I extend thanks to all professionals who contributed documents, evidence, and representations, including statutory agencies such as the NHS Secure Psychological Unit, Counter Terrorism Policing North East, the Probation Service, and local authority safeguarding teams, as well as voluntary sector contributors and family members of the defendant who provided written material in mitigation.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. They have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction will be transmitted to the appropriate custodial and supervisory authorities forthwith.

These are the orders of the court.
