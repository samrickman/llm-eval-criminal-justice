IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/31864  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. PATERSON  
Filed: 3 October 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction on one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The timeframe in question extends from early 2023 until Mr H’s arrest on 17 February 2025.  

The defendant was initially detained at 07:15 hours on Monday 17 February 2025, following the execution by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) of warrants at an address in Redcliffe, Bristol. The warrants were issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 on the basis of intelligence provided by the Security Service (commonly referred to as MI5). This intelligence indicated activity linked to a secure communications account, accessed through a VPN service registered to Mr H, which had exchanged encrypted files with an overseas server associated with extremist ideologies. In executing the warrants, officers seized two laptops, multiple encrypted USB flash drives, and a range of military-grade components specified in the investigation.

The arrest marked the conclusion of an intensive investigatory operation that lasted close to eight months. CTPSW and partner agencies relied heavily upon the capabilities of the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), whose digital experts devoted over 3,000 man-hours to decrypting and analysing communications and files. Of note was the methodical use of steganography to conceal plans within innocuous images, complicating initial efforts to establish evidential connections. Such technical sophistication is not uncommon in terrorism investigations, reflecting a disturbing evolution of tactics employed by those intent on radicalisation and violence.  

It should be noted that the court received correspondence from the Legal Services Commission dated 12 March 2025, addressing delays in the provision of Legal Aid funding necessary for securing expert defence representation. The adjudication of these funds was protracted, resulting in the scheduling of initial hearings being deferred while authority was sought for disclosure review and commissioning of independent forensic IT experts. The court records this procedural impediment with regret, as timely provision of Legal Aid is fundamental to the proper administration of justice.  

It is worth pausing to acknowledge the role of the Counter Terrorism Prevent Programme in this matter. Mr H was subject to Prevent engagement dating back to late 2021, following a referral made by a lecturer at a local university where he was enrolled in part-time studies. That referral was prompted by concerns over his production of an academic paper which incorporated quotations from banned materials without critical analysis, alongside inflammatory social media posts. The Prevent Channel Panel considered the case but discontinued active intervention due to Mr H’s minimal engagement and lack of tangible progress in changing his ideological stance. This court is aware of the complex balance between safeguarding and civil liberties inherent in Prevent operations and does not seek to criticise individual practitioners. Their work, undertaken under difficult circumstances and with limited resources, is nonetheless vital to public safety.  

Delays in listing this matter for trial were exacerbated by industrial action affecting court staff and an increasing backlog of cases relating to terrorism offences, a category now occupying a substantial proportion of Crown Court business. These pressures, combined with the demand for secure court facilities and classified hearings, have overstretched available judicial and administrative capacity. In this context, the court expresses its gratitude to court clerks and security personnel who maintain standards despite these difficult conditions.  

A trial preparation hearing was conducted on 15 July 2025. Early indications had suggested the likelihood of a contested trial; however, Mr H entered pleas of guilty to both counts on the morning of the trial’s commencement date, 21 September 2025. The timing of this plea impacted the discount available for prompt admission of guilt. It is a regrettable but well-documented tendency for defendants to delay pleas, a practice reviewed in the Court of Appeal decision in R v. Bancroft [2024] EWCA Crim 1108, which expressly limited credit to 15% for pleas entered shortly before or at trial where the guilty verdict was inescapable.

The court takes occasion to refer to the pertinent sentencing guidelines under the Terrorism Act 2006, particularly the framework set out by the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Guidelines on Terrorist Offences. These provide structured direction on assessing level of culpability, ranging from highest culpability attributable to individuals engaged in actual attack planning to low culpability for isolated preparatory acts without evidence of clear intent or technical sophistication. In the seminal case of R v. Mertens [2018] EWCA Crim 3, the Court of Appeal highlighted the need to balance proportionality with deterrence, emphasising that sentences must reflect the scale and nature of the intended harm, the defendant’s motivational factors, and their role relative to co-conspirators. Although the latter factor is of less relevance here, given Mr H acted independently, the case assists in setting the spectrum of sentencing considerations.  

Unrelated but of interest in the broader criminal landscape—although bearing no relation to Mr H’s conduct—a recent case reported as R v. Sanderson [2024] EWCA Crim 1779 involved serious offences of commercial fly-tipping within a protected green belt area, resulting in extensive ecological damage to local wildlife and waterways. Included in the court’s wider research file is a report commissioned by the Environment Agency detailing increasing environmental crimes, especially illegal waste dumping. This context, while irrelevant to the present defendant’s actions, reflects the broad range of public protection priorities confronting enforcement bodies.  

During the course of the trial preparation hearing, the court also reviewed reports submitted by NHS Forensic Psychiatry Services. These reports indicated that Mr H declined formal psychiatric assessment despite repeated outreach. In the light of this, and in common with previous analogous cases such as R v. Eldridge [2020] EWCA Crim 942, the court recognizes the challenges faced in engaging defendants with deeply held extremist ideologies in mental health interventions. The report authored by Dr Simon Carlisle, Lead Consultant Psychiatrist, acknowledged cognitive rigidity and “an entrenched worldview marked by black-and-white thinking,” but found no formal diagnosis of psychosis or other severe mental illness requiring compulsion.  

At the same time, the court acknowledges the systemic pressures on forensic mental health teams. Increasing referrals for personality disorder assessments and complex trauma cases, coupled with longstanding recruitment difficulties, have resulted in considerable waiting times and constrained availability of structured, evidence-based interventions specifically targeting extremism. These shortcomings are widely recognised within health service commissioning reviews and pose ongoing risks for rehabilitation efforts.

The defendant’s digital footprint was the subject of careful scrutiny in this case. Forensic analysts recovered multiple encrypted “vaults” stored within cloud services that had been linked to the defendant’s network traffic. The contents included not only bomb-making manuals and ideologically charged videos, but also detailed logbooks of component acquisition and test runs. The court accepts submissions that Mr H had an extensive knowledge of explosive chemistry, corroborated by his academic background in chemical engineering. Defence counsel argued for the possibility of “mere curiosity” or intellectual fascination, but the totality of evidence, including testimony from a specialist bomb technician, clarified that the intent was operational, not hypothetical.  

As an aside and unrelated to the defendant, it is recorded that one of the co-defendants in the concurrent Operation RAVEN investigation was charged with criminal damage to a church noticeboard in the district of Bath during the summer of 2024. That offense was prosecuted separately and bears no connection to Mr H or these proceedings other than shared investigative teams. Including such detail serves to illustrate the diversity of criminal activity that must be juggled by law enforcement.  

The court notes that digital forensics teams working on this and related cases face an ever-growing workload. Advances in encryption technology, combined with anonymity services, have led to delays in decrypting material sufficient for evidential use. Nationally, more than 75% of digital devices submitted to police forensic hubs contain encrypted content requiring specialist analysis. This phenomenon has created a bottleneck in case progression, adding to delays in judicial process. In Operation TUNE, a coordinated multi-force initiative, over 20 terabytes of data were procured, from which investigators distilled fragments demonstrating intent and capability.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Mr H’s conduct included surveillance of potential targets using drones, a fact not without wider resonance in judicial considerations regarding technological misuse. In R v. Elwood [2023] EWHC 241, the High Court emphasised that drone-facilitated reconnaissance for hostile purposes constitutes an aggravating factor warranting substantial custodial sentences, given the ease with which such devices enable remote and unobserved observation. The court in that case attached significant weight to the defendant’s use of encrypted communications and modified hardware to reduce detection risk. Although Mr H’s piloting skills and technological sophistication were not at the same level, parallels remain pertinent.  

By contrast, the court has also considered reports concerning the defendant’s personal circumstances and background. Born in 1996, Mr H grew up in a reasonably stable family environment within the wider Bristol area. He attended local state schools and proceeded to university before withdrawing from formal education in 2022. Letters submitted on his behalf from community groups confirm a limited record of volunteering in elder support services prior to the escalation of his offending behaviour. Such contributions, while to be commended, do not counterbalance the severity of the offences for which he now stands sentenced.  

The court was provided with a detailed psychological assessment by Professor Emma Thorne, consultant forensic psychologist at Northwood Secure Unit. The report noted elevated levels of cognitive inflexibility, alongside tendencies towards social isolation and limited empathy. Professor Thorne emphasised that while no diagnosable personality disorder was established, the defendant exhibits traits consistent with vulnerability to radical ideologies. The risk of persistent extremist belief and potential recidivism was assessed as high without intensive intervention and supervision.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The court also received documentation relating to Mr H’s travel history. Airline and bus company records confirmed a trip to Berlin in June 2024, where he reportedly attended a conference ostensibly on sustainable urban transport. However, surveillance data and CCTV footage placed him in proximity to known extremist organisers on two separate occasions during that trip. Defence counsel suggested coincidence, but the weight of encrypted chats contemporaneous with those dates mitigates against that assertion.  

It is necessary to observe the ongoing strain under which probation services operate, particularly in cases involving individuals convicted of terrorism-related offences. The National Probation Service faces acute workload pressures, exacerbated by chronic staff shortages, high caseloads, and increasingly demanding risk management requirements. This context underlies the court’s instruction that any pre-sentence report provide thorough consideration of resource implications and suitability of interventions.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial investigations revealed multiple cryptocurrency transactions conducted by Mr H. A forensically analysed payment of approximately £3,100 was traced from a Bitcoin wallet linked to the defendant’s known online identities to an account associated with importation of dual-use chemicals. The court is cognisant of recent advisories by the Financial Conduct Authority warning that cryptocurrencies, while offering legitimate benefits, are increasingly exploited for illicit activity due to their pseudonymous nature. Such use complicates regulatory oversight and enforcement efforts.  

In a seemingly unrelated matter, the court is aware of a concurrent prosecution in the Bristol District Court concerning theft of copper cabling from a rail maintenance depot. That case, brought against unknown persons, involves significant infrastructure disruption but remains distinct from the instant matter. Inclusion of such detail serves only an informational purpose regarding the operational context of law enforcement.  

During the investigation, significant covert surveillance was deployed. Close circuit television recordings linked Mr H to visits to secluded riverbank areas in the Avon Gorge on multiple occasions, often late at night. As described by CTPSW officers, the collation of such footage demands painstaking effort, combining multiple data streams including time-stamped observations, geospatial metadata, and network latency analysis to confirm identities. This work consumed approximately 130 analyst hours. The court acknowledges the dedication such tasks require in the face of finite personnel and competing case demands.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to the issue of culpability and mitigation, the court accepts that Mr H has no previous criminal convictions. The defence has highlighted his generally law-abiding conduct prior to the period under scrutiny. His academic achievements, notably in STEM subjects, and limited community engagement testify to latent potential. However, the deliberate nature of his offences and level of technical execution diminish the weight of such mitigation. The court must ensure that the sentence imposed reflects both individual circumstances and the broader imperatives of public protection and deterrence.  

Letters of support submitted on Mr H’s behalf include testimonials from a local gardening society, the Bristol Youth Arts Collective, and a care charity for older adults. These affirm his past volunteer activities and personality traits described as “disciplined” and “thoughtful.” While commendable, such endorsements do not obscure the fact that the defendant’s choices have caused profound harm to social cohesion and public safety. Additionally, correspondence from the East Bristol Prevent Team chronicles considerable engagement efforts, much of which was met with limited cooperation or outright refusal to participate in deradicalisation programmes. Such disengagement represents a concerning challenge to effective rehabilitation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

In conclusion, this was an offence of a most serious nature, characterised by careful planning, ideological commitment, and significant technical capability. It demanded a robust and proportionate sentencing response in order to underline society’s condemnation of terrorism and to protect the public. The defendant’s profile suggests a persistent risk of radicalisation and harm without intensive, multi-agency management upon release. The court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report with particular attention to risk assessment, suitability for extended determinate sentencing under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and identification of appropriate custodial and community-based interventions including Structured Professional Judgment frameworks and multi-disciplinary mental health input.  

These sentencing remarks are issued on this 3rd day of October 2025 in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been fully transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. Notification of conviction and sentence will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities, including the Police National Computer and Criminal Records Bureau. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days, as prescribed by the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply to this matter. Costs remain reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
