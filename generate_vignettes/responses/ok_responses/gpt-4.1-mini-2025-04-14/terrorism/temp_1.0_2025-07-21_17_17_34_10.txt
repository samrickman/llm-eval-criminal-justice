IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29346  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. J. WALTHAM  
Filed: 15 September 2025  

Mr H stands before this court for sentence on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected to terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct underlying these charges relates predominantly to the period commencing in late 2022 through to his arrest in May 2025.  

The case has been listed on multiple occasions since charge, with several adjournments attributable to logistical challenges facing both the prosecution and defence teams, including protracted disclosure demands and the need to accommodate a specialist psychiatric evaluation. It is notable that one listing was vacated at short notice on 2 July 2025 when the defence made an application for further time to receive digital forensic materials relating to encrypted messaging platforms. This delay highlights, yet again, the ever-increasing complexity of terrorism investigations in the digital age.  

Mr H’s arrest took place on 19 May 2025 at an address in Acocks Green, executed with a search warrant issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant and subsequent search were authorised following intelligence from a combined effort by West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit (WMCTU), the National Crime Agency’s Cyber Terrorism Team, and the Security Service. At the point of arrest, officers seized multiple electronic devices, including laptops, smartphones, and several encrypted USB drives, underscoring the defendant’s sophisticated use of technology.

This investigation formed part of Operation NIGHTFALL, a multifaceted inquiry blending human intelligence, signals intelligence, and covert surveillance. The efforts extended over an 18-month period, requiring considerable inter-agency cooperation across police forces, intelligence services, and forensic experts. The National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES) played a pivotal role in the recovery and analysis of encrypted materials, a process complicated by Mr H’s use of open-source virtual machines and anonymising networks. The resource implications of such investigations are substantial, imposing a heavy financial burden on public agencies, which, in the context of widespread austerity, compound the already stretched budgets of frontline policing and security services.  

It is well documented that operational priorities must be balanced against such constraints. Given the gravity of the allegations, however, the level of dedication and specialist expertise marshalled by involved teams was appropriate and necessary. The court notes with some appreciation that, despite ongoing pressures, disclosure schedules were maintained in compliance with Criminal Procedure Rules, albeit marginally. The periodic delays observed were, in this instance, matters of inadvertent operational fatigue rather than systemic failure. Nonetheless, the court endorses the ongoing calls for enhanced technological investment to reduce bottlenecks in digital evidence examination.  

The defendant was initially bailed following his arrest, subject to stringent electronic monitoring and a curfew, pending further evidential development. The conditions were regularly reviewed, reflecting the risk-based approach outlined in the National Counter Terrorism Policing Framework. Following summons to answer the charges, the case progressed to the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing (PTPH) on 30 July 2025. On this date, Mr H altered his pleas to guilty on both counts, albeit only shortly before the commencement of the contested trial. Such a late plea, while to be noted, cannot attract the full mitigation ordinarily afforded by an early admission.  

The principles governing sentencing credit for guilty pleas were examined extensively in R v. Calvert [2023] EWCA Crim 1123, a case involving similar terrorism offences where the defendant entered a guilty plea only after arraignment and substantial preparatory hearings had taken place. The Court of Appeal sanctioned a modest credit of 15%, emphasising that credit fosters judicial economy but must reflect genuine remorse and an early acceptance of responsibility. Precedents such as R v. Millward [2019] EWCA Crim 2346 also reinforce that tactical plea changes at the last moment, motivated by recognition of an overwhelming case rather than moral reckoning, should be discounted accordingly.  

In considering the relevant sentencing framework, the court adopts the Terrorism Act Sentencing Council Guidelines updated in 2023, which prescribe a structured assessment of culpability levels, ranging from low to very high, with aggravating and mitigating factors duly considered. The highest culpability tier is characteristically reserved for offenders exhibiting sustained planning, possession of materials with intent to cause mass harm, or demonstrated use of encrypted communications to avoid detection. Relevant case law includes R v. Doran [2021] EWCA Crim 859, which highlights the court’s duty to proportionately reflect public protection imperatives alongside deterrence and rehabilitation objectives.  

It is instructive also to remember that while the court must sentence based on the particulars of the defendant's conduct, it operates within a wider societal matrix. The normalization of extremist rhetoric on online platforms and the proliferation of digital encryption tools have introduced significant challenges not only to law enforcement but to the judicial process itself. The balance struck herein must be firm yet measured, reflecting the gravity of unlawful endeavour but also recognising the multifaceted nature of radicalisation and risk reduction.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

As the evidence illustrates, Mr H maintained an online presence under multiple pseudonyms, disseminating material supportive of violent extremism. Linguistic and forensic experts provided detailed analysis linking the defendant’s posts to established extremist narratives. The court acknowledges the substantial volume of communication traffic, which persisted despite engagement offers from the West Midlands Prevent Team between 2020 and 2023. These interventions included counselling and mentoring which, while well-intentioned, yielded mixed evidence of behavioural modification. The channel referral process, while operationally robust, remains hampered by resourcing shortfalls and varying levels of community trust.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Technological evidence recovered included encrypted archives labelled cryptically, accessible only via complex passphrases known solely to the defendant. These archives contained manuals on improvised explosive devices and detailed schematics of transport infrastructure vulnerabilities. The defence team sought to assert that the defendant’s interest was academic or speculative, referencing a range of non-extremist engineering texts recovered from the same digital devices. The court finds this submission unconvincing in the totality of contextual evidence, particularly when contrasted with the timing of online activity and possession of associated paraphernalia.  

In the course of investigation, a minor quantity of cannabis was discovered in the flat shared with Mr H’s roommate. No charge has arisen for this finding, and the court considers it an unremarkable episode in terms of risk or character assessment. It is noted only for completeness and in recognition of counsel’s attempt to humanise the defendant’s profile. The court also acknowledges that Mr H’s landlord had previously been the subject of a regulatory noise abatement order unrelated to the defendant, an enterprise entirely divorced from the matters at hand.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

A careful review of Mr H’s travel record reveals a number of trips taken within the United Kingdom and to EU countries. While some were reportedly for academic conferences and family visits, other journeys, such as a visit to a coastal town in Belgium, attracted additional scrutiny due to the presence of known extremist gatherings. Surveillance indicated Mr H’s attendance at certain locations where radical ideological dissemination is known to occur. The court does not discount the possibility that some travel may have had innocent explanation; however, the temporal proximity to incriminating online activity militates against benign inferences.  

The defendant’s prior history is sparse. No previous convictions feature on his record. His educational attainment, culminating in an honours degree in computer science, paints a picture of a capable individual who, nonetheless, became overtaken by ideological fixation. Letters of support from voluntary sector groups, including a local environmental charity where Mr H volunteered sporadically, were submitted in mitigation but must be set against the underpinning offence gravity. It is not without irony that the court receives positive accounts from such organisations as the city’s ongoing problem with graffiti on public transport infrastructure remains unresolved, underscoring wider social challenges.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

A notable element of prosecution evidence concerns Mr H’s involvement in procurement attempts for precursor chemicals. Inquiry revealed digital communications with contacts abroad who arrange logistics for dual-use materials, customarily used in agricultural and industrial applications but with known potential misuse. The court has noted submissions regarding the historic case of R v. Calder [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, which dealt with controlling behaviour and coercion in a domestic context and is of tangential relevance here given the differing factual scenario. Nonetheless, the authorities serve to remind the court of the importance of an analytic framework stretched across contexts yet tailored to the particularities of each defendant’s conduct.  

The court is aware of the pressures faced by probation and mental health services tasked with managing individuals of elevated risk. The overwhelming workload in the West Midlands Probation Trust, exacerbated by staff shortages and budgetary limitations, signifies a systemic challenge. The NHS forensic psychiatric services report prolonged waiting times for assessment, a factor which, while regrettable, has no bearing on culpability but may influence future management recommendations.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial investigations have revealed transactions made via cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, totalling approximately £3,200, involving parties connected to overseas darknet marketplaces. Such exchanges remain an enduring concern for detection, tracing, and prosecution. The court acknowledges the submissions made about the transformative and at times disruptive influence of decentralised finance technology — applications heralded by some as democratizing, but exploited by others to facilitate illicit activity beyond conventional oversight. The legal apparatus must evolve to meet these challenges, a point already emphasised by the Law Commission in its 2024 consultation on financial crime reform.  

It is of interest — though tangential — that several underground garages in the district of Aston have experienced a recent string of fly-tipping incidents, ranging from the dumping of household waste to hazardous chemical containers. This environmental degradation, while unrelated to the present case, serves as a reminder of the manifold challenges faced by local authorities amidst constrained resources and rising urban blight. The incorporation of such detail here is merely for contextual awareness, not to prejudice sentencing.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The defendant’s psychological evaluation was conducted by Dr Nina Castillo, consultant forensic psychiatrist, instructed by the defence and approved by the court. Her report, submitted on 18 August 2025, detailed Mr H’s mental state and assessed risk potential. Dr Castillo diagnosed a personality profile featuring marked cognitive inflexibility and a tendency for black-and-white moral reasoning, but no formal diagnosis of psychotic disorder or mood illness. The evaluation concluded that Mr H presents a high risk of reoffending in the ideological extremism spectrum if released without enhanced supervision and engagement in de-radicalisation programmes.  

The letter from the Deliver-It-Forward charity, which provides food parcels and social inclusion activities within the city’s hardship areas, praises the defendant’s punctuality and willingness to help while volunteering over six months. It is a testament to the myriad ways civil society strives to maintain social fabric, even while grappling with the consequences of exclusion and radicalisation. The court records this with a degree of solemn respect.  

Attention is drawn also to the case of R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, often cited in regard to sentencing credit reduction for late guilty pleas in the context of attempted arson in council housing. While not factually linked to the present matter, its articulation of the principles concerning judicial discretion remains instructive.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The circumstances here present a sophisticated and premeditated pattern of behaviour. There are aggravating factors including deliberate encryption, possession of potentially destructive devices, procurement networks, and an expressed willingness to imbue operations with symbolic resonance through timing coinciding with anniversaries of prior attacks widely reported in extremist media. Mitigating factors are limited to the absence of prior convictions, educational achievements which may underpin rehabilitative potential, and the defendant’s eventual guilty pleas, albeit late-stage.  

The court has considered the submissions on behalf of the defendant, who is represented by Mr Jeremy Fox, instructed by the Legal Aid Agency, for whose professionalism the court is grateful. We are mindful of persistent systemic difficulties affecting legal aid availability and case progression, including challenges in securing appropriate expert witnesses at relatively short notice and delays in material disclosure due to existing caseloads. These procedural vicissitudes, while extraneous to culpability, nonetheless impact the administration of justice and, therefore, merit ongoing attention at a policy level.  

In order to assist this court in arriving at a sentence proportionate both to the offence and to public protection needs, I direct the probation service to prepare a comprehensive pre-sentence report. This should encompass, inter alia, assessments of Mr H’s prospects for reintegration, potential for engagement with cognitive-behavioural programmes targeting radical thinking patterns, suitability for structured accommodation with restrictive conditions, and the likely effectiveness of any electronic monitoring measures tailored to terrorism risk management. Specialist liaison with the West Midlands Prevent Hub should inform the report, ensuring that existing risk management strategies are coherently considered.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been duly transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentence and conviction record will be transmitted to relevant authorities for registration and enforcement.  

These are the orders of the court.
