IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL
R v. Mr H   
Case No. B2025/24216  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. D. CLARKE  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H appears for sentence upon his conviction on the charges laid under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and under section 57(1) of the Terrorism Act 2000 for possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The period of offending is alleged to extend from early 2023 until his arrest in February 2025. This court convenes following his conviction at trial on 5 September 2025, after a five-day hearing before a duly empanelled jury.  

The procedural history of this matter is notable for its complexity, reflecting the need to balance the imperatives of open justice with those of national security, and the complexities presented by extensive digital evidence and multi-layered forensic examinations. From the outset, the case demonstrated some of the perennial tensions endemic to counter-terrorism prosecutions—especially the competing demands placed upon disclosure obligations, the need to protect sensitive intelligence sources, and the adversarial system’s demand for clarity and fairness.  

The first arrest of the defendant took place at approximately 07:45 on 19 February 2025 at his residence in Knowle, Bristol, by officers of Counter-Terrorism Policing South West, following the execution of a search warrant authorised under Section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant was supported by intercepted communications intelligence, which had been subject to intensive scrutiny and produced by the Security Service under strict supervision to ensure compliance with statutory safeguards. At the time of the arrest, officers seized multiple electronic devices, including a laptop, a mobile phone, a number of external hard drives, and various computing components, including equipment capable of 3D printing.

The investigation leading to the arrest was the culmination of a prolonged and resource-intensive operation utilising multiple strands of intelligence gathering. These included traditional surveillance and human intelligence, digital forensics, and sophisticated pattern-of-life analysis. The forensic examination of digital assets required the intervention of expert teams at the National Cybercrime Centre, whose resources at the time were notably under strain, grappling as they were with a backlog of over 15,000 complex cases requiring detailed decryption and data recovery. This limitation necessarily introduced certain delays in the provision of evidence during pre-trial phases, to the understandable frustration of all parties involved.  

While the investigation focused firmly on the defendant, it is necessary to place the offending within a wider environment in which organised criminality and complex conspiracies often entail a multiplicity of actors. For example, the court notes with reference only and without connection to the defendant that co-defendants in a separate but related Case B2025/24310 have been charged with burglary of a private dwelling during a period in which the occupants were away on holiday. It is the responsibility of the prosecution to establish a clear nexus between individual defendants and their particular offending, a principle deeply embedded in criminal jurisprudence, and care must be taken to avoid conflating distinct criminal conduct without proper evidential basis.  

The care taken to maintain evidentiary integrity throughout this investigation was particularly manifest in the methodical approach taken to digital surveillance and evidence gathering. For instance, the court is made aware of the innovative folding of forensic geolocation data with transportation records to track the defendant’s movements. While such application of emerging technologies is increasingly central to law enforcement’s capacity to detect sophisticated offending, it simultaneously raises issues touching on privacy rights and statutory oversight, a balance with which Parliament has grappled since the enactment of the Investigatory Powers Act 2016.  

During the bail period, procedural delays were occasioned by the need to obtain disclosure of material subject to Public Interest Immunity (PII) claims. Defence counsel raised concerns regarding the extent and timeliness of these disclosures, yet the court finds that the authorities acted within reasonable bounds, exercising caution appropriately in this intricate investigative matrix. That said, concerns remain regarding the capacity of related agencies, such as the Legal Aid Authority, to provide the necessary resources in light of recurring budgetary retrenchment, a factor that has adversely affected the defence’s capacity to secure prompt expert input.  

The defendant’s engagement with the Prevent programme dates back some eighteen months prior to the arrest. The Calmerside Prevent Hub, a multi-agency unit operating under the broader Channel initiative, provided the court with records documenting a complex but limited engagement with Mr H, including offers of mentorship and tailored cognitive behavioural therapy aimed at reducing grievance-based radicalisation. His participation was uneven, characterised by sporadic attendance and partial compliance. This pattern of intermittent engagement aligns with findings from empirical studies on deradicalisation, suggesting that such efforts face significant challenges where motivation wavers or scepticism prevails.

Of note is the defendant’s online footprint, which featured a lengthy series of communications disseminated under various pseudonyms across encrypted platforms. These activities merit significant consideration in assessing both the degree of premeditation and the ideological commitment underpinning the offending. Linguistic analysis by expert witnesses established that his writings echoed language hallmarking proscribed organisations, mirroring both thematic and stylistic elements identified in authorised counter-terrorism research.  

Understanding this conduct requires placing it against the historical development of counter-terrorism legislation. Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 was introduced following the recognition that earlier statutes, such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, did not adequately cover preparatory conduct. Since its enactment, jurisprudence has clarified the scope of “engaging in conduct in preparation,” most notably in R v. Ahmed [2018] EWCA Crim 705, where the Court outlined that preparatory acts must be both purposeful and proximate to intended terrorist outcomes, albeit not necessarily close in temporal terms.  

In relation to possession of articles, the Court recalls the guidance in R v. Bilal [2019] EWCA Crim 17, which emphasised the importance of considering the context and intended use of articles, particularly when widely available materials may be used for innocent purposes. These principles were critical in evaluating the forensic evidence of materials seized during search warrants executed at the defendant’s premises.  

The expert examination of digital artefacts also uncovered a subset labelled “Project Pyxis,” comprising encrypted files containing technical schematics for the manufacture of explosive devices. This discovery was pivotal in establishing the offensive capabilities the defendant sought to develop. The Court notes the meticulous manner in which the defendant sought to conceal these materials, utilising layered encryption and virtual private networks, techniques designed specifically to thwart law enforcement intervention.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Expert witness testimony also detailed a comparison of these schematics with those disseminated by known extremist entities, lending weight to the prosecution’s assertion of ideological impetus. The defence’s attempt to characterise the defendant’s possession of such material as scholastic curiosity was found unavailing given the broader intelligence picture. The adjudication drew upon the statutory presumption arising from possession of an article for a purpose connected to the commission of an offence under the 2000 Act, a provision extensively discussed in Law Commission Consultation Paper No. 220, which the courts have applied with due rigour in terrorism-related cases.  

A further evidentiary point taken into account was the defendant’s use of remote storage devices and encrypted messaging platforms, notably “Threema” and “Signal.” Defence counsel sought to argue that such technologies are commonly employed for legitimate privacy purposes; while this claim holds at a general level, the prosecution’s case effectively demonstrated their deployment as part of a sophisticated operational security protocol consistent with intent to avoid detection.

This court is mindful of the pressing pressures faced by public service institutions, including those involved in housing, mental health support, and probationary supervision. The escalating levels of homelessness and begging observed in urban centres, while not directly connected to the present defendant, exemplify broader social challenges to law enforcement resources. Reports from the Bristol Homeless Outreach Team indicate a rising demand for assistance alongside diminishing capacity, a dynamic that indirectly affects public safety environments.  

Furthermore, the probation service tasked with preparing reports in terrorist offending continues to grapple with historic staffing shortages and overwhelming caseloads. These systemic difficulties limit the timeliness and depth of assessments, reinforcing the importance of early engagement and coordinated multi-agency approaches.  

Not all delays can be ascribed to resource constraints. At the case management hearing on 10 August 2025, the court was obliged to adjourn the sentencing date in order to accommodate a late application from the defence to admit evidence of the defendant’s sister’s character and support letters from the Bristol Solidarity Project and Community Futures Trust. While the material was duly considered, its probative value with respect to sentencing was, in the court’s view, largely peripheral. It serves, however, as a reminder of the crucial role played by the voluntary sector in addressing the complex socio-economic dynamics intertwined with radicalisation.  

The community organisations referenced have operated under considerable funding uncertainty and persistent capacity strain, yet have continued to offer valuable interventions and monitoring. Their correspondence acknowledges the challenge of mitigating ideological extremism without undermining community cohesion—an objective consonant with the principles laid out in the Prevent Duty Guidance issued pursuant to the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015.

The defendant’s travel history includes documented foreign trips to locations notable for political instability and unrest. One such journey, ostensibly for a cultural exchange programme, took Mr H to Istanbul in April 2024. This trip intersected with scheduled regional unrest, and the defendant’s movements during that period included an attempted cross-border journey into Syrian territory that was frustrated by governmental intervention and cancelled flights. This circumstance was the subject of detailed exploration both in witness statements and covert electronic surveillance intercepts.  

Historical case law offers instructive parallels. In R v. Altun [2017] EWCA Crim 1547, the defendant’s foreign travel to conflict zones was a salient aggravating factor, even in the absence of successful ingress, because it evidenced intent and preparation consistent with a heightened culpability tier. It is this reasoning that guides the court in considering Mr H’s itinerary and conduct abroad.

Financial investigation by a forensic accountant disclosed a series of cryptocurrency transactions exhibiting a pattern of incremental payments directed towards online vendors dealing in dual-use materials. Despite the anonymity features inherently designed into blockchain networks, law enforcement utilised a combination of conventional financial intelligence and emerging analytic tools to trace a transaction totalling approximately £1,870 sent from a wallet controlled by the defendant. This wallet was linked, via multiple intermediate transactions through tumblers, to a marketplace known to facilitate illicit arms trade.  

The complexities of investigating cryptocurrency transactions are well documented, with recent law reform proposals seeking to impose stricter Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements on digital asset exchanges. Courts have, in recent decisions such as R v. Chen [2024] EWCA Crim 412, been called upon to grapple with the implications of such technologies for evidential standards and sentencing, recognising the challenges posed by financial anonymity to prosecutorial efforts seeking to disrupt terrorism financing.  

Additional covert surveillance logs illustrate the defendant’s repeated, clandestine visits to the Bristol docks area during the autumn of 2024. The coordination of multiple angles of low-light CCTV, time-synchronised RFID sensor data from container movements, and mobile device location tracking collectively consumed significant investigative hours. The patience and dedication of surveillance analysts in piecing together these fragmentary yet revealing observations cannot be overstated.

Turning to the defendant’s personal background, Mr H is 30 years of age and holds a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from a noted university in the South West. His employment history, too, was marked by a period of steady engagement with a local engineering firm specialising in industrial automation systems. His supervising manager, in a letter submitted in mitigation, describes him as “meticulous, reliable, and quietly efficient,” though also notes that his resignation in late 2022 followed disputes over security clearances required for tendered contracts involving national defence clients.  

The court is appreciative of the character references tendered from community building organisations praising the defendant’s volunteer efforts in skills workshops. While positive, such mitigating factors must be weighed cautiously in terrorism cases, bearing in mind the overarching imperatives of deterrence and public protection. The presence of pro-social activity cannot obscure serious ideological and operational breaches of the law.  

The defendant’s sister, in a statement, expresses concern about signs of increasing isolation and ideological rigidity during 2023, attributing this in part to the impact of social media echo chambers, a phenomenon of growing concern identified by the Independent Online Safety Regulator. These personal circumstances, while tragic, must be contextualised within the broader framework of culpability and risk.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Clinical assessments conducted by Professor Ramesh Patel, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, concluded that Mr H displays marked cognitive inflexibility and intermittent symptoms consistent with an anxiety disorder, but no diagnosable psychotic illness or intellectual disability. Crucially, the report emphasises Mr H’s engagement with extremist ideation as volitional rather than pathologically compelled, elevating the risk of recidivism absent sustained management. The risk assessments recommend intensive supervision post-release, combining psychological support with electronic monitoring and strict licence conditions restricting digital access.  

In considering the appropriate sentence, the court is guided by the Terrorism Act 2006 Section 5 sentencing framework and the applicable Sentencing Council guidelines. Aggravating features here include the ideological commitment demonstrated by the prolonged preparatory conduct, the sophistication of operational security measures employed, and the association with proscribed material and networks.  

Conversely, mitigation is primarily confined to Mr H’s early engagement with the Prevent programme, absence of previous convictions, his late but unequivocal guilty pleas entered on 2 October 2025, and his expressed willingness to participate in structured deradicalisation initiatives. These factors, while relevant, do not substantially diminish the gravity of the offence or the risk posed.  

Historical precedent underscores the importance of deterrence and public protection. In R v. Kershaw [2025] EWCA Crim 411, the Court of Appeal upheld extended custodial sentences for preparatory terrorism offences, stating that sentences must convey clear societal condemnation and incapacitate where risk is high.  

The court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Probation Service, to include an evaluation of Mr H’s suitability for Extended Determinate Sentence provisions under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, consideration of GPS monitoring and polygraph testing, and the feasibility of involvement in evidence-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy programmes focused on ideological disengagement. The report will also address accommodation arrangements compatible with risk management strategies, including exclusion zones and electronic curfews.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been conducted in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules and duly transcribed. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate authorities. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
