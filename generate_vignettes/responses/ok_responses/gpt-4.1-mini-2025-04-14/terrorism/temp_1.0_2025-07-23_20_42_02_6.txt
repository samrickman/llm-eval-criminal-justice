IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/23984  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. F. MONTGOMERY  
Filed: 18 August 2025  

Mr H appears before this court today for sentence following conviction on charges under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts, as well as possession of an article for purposes connected to terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These offences, as the prosecution contends, spanned a period commencing in late 2022 and culminating in Mr H’s arrest in early March of 2025.  

On 4 March 2025, just before dawn, Mr H was taken into custody at his residence in the Hartcliffe district of Bristol. The arrest followed an extensive investigation conducted jointly by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW), supported by the National Crime Agency’s Digital Crime Unit and the Metropolitan Police’s Forensic Chemistry Division. Search warrants issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 authorised the seizure of multiple electronic devices, healthcare paraphernalia, and various printed laboratory notes. It is noteworthy that at the time of arrest, Mr H was alone; no co-defendants were present, and no others have yet been implicated directly in these proceedings.

This investigation grew from intelligence initially garnered through signal interception authorised under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Regulations. The court is reminded that such interception requires strict adherence to judicial oversight, balanced against the imperatives of national security. The delay inherent in obtaining timely judicial approvals, particularly where evidential thresholds are met only circumstantially, is a practical reality of modern counter-terrorism work. The investigatory process was prolonged by Mr H’s use of sophisticated encryption and anonymisation software — tactics designed explicitly to thwart detection and analysis.  

It warrants mention that the defendant’s initial detention period saw multiple applications for bail, all invariably refused given the evaluated level of risk to the public, coupled with the ongoing nature of the enquiry. The special custodial arrangements here included enhanced monitoring and restricted contact pursuant to section 51 of the Terrorism Act 2000, underlining the potential gravity of the offence.  

It is regrettable, and somewhat symptomatic of broader systemic shortfalls, that despite the best efforts of the Legal Aid Agency, there were notable delays in securing authorisation for independent expert instruction. The defence’s request for a psychiatric report, initially made in May 2025, was not resolved until early July 2025, highlighting the ongoing challenges and under-resourcing faced by providers tasked with facilitating fair trial rights in complex cases.  

A so-called “Prevent referral” had been made in 2020 following concerns expressed by a university mentor regarding Mr H’s participation in online forums espousing grievance narratives linked to proscribed groups. That referral, however, failed to progress beyond an initial assessment within the Channel framework, as he demonstrated intermittent engagement and had not yet committed any overtly criminal acts. The role and efficacy of early intervention schemes such as Channel is subject to considerable parliamentary debate. Nonetheless, this court must judge on evidence presented, not hypotheticals about what might have been done better in neutral periods.  

In terms of procedural history, a plea and case management hearing was convened on 12 July 2025. At that juncture, Mr H pleaded not guilty, necessitating the preparation of substantial trial bundles and expert reports spanning digital forensics, chemical analysis, and psychological assessment. The trial, originally scheduled for September 2025, was vacated following the defendant’s change of plea on the morning of the 14 August sentencing hearing. This late plea limits the credit that can be plotted under established sentencing principles, given the extensive preparatory work that the Crown, court staff, and witnesses endured up to that point.  

The boundaries of sentencing credit for late pleas were crystallised in the recent case of R v. Farnsworth [2024] EWCA Crim 1602, which explored the diminishing utilitarian benefits credited where pleas are entered only after exhaustive pre-trial processes — an issue routinely arising in terrorism prosecutions due to their inherent complexity. In Farnsworth, a late plea entered after a three-week trial listing was afforded a mere one-sixth reduction, reflecting both pragmatic considerations and the broader interests of justice.  

Historic case law also offers guidance. In R v. Jalloh [2018] EWCA Crim 2247, the Crown Court underscored that pleas motivated by tactical advantage rather than genuine contrition “must not distort the calculus of credit” nor “dilute the message of deterrence inherent in terrorism sentencing.” Neither do pleas entered post-trial footprint searches or after the admission of recovered communication records, such as seen in R v. Diaz [2019] EWCA Crim 850.   

The maximum sentence for an offence under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 remains life imprisonment. The Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Offences Guideline (“the Guideline”) requires consideration of the gravity factors including sophistication, level of planning, impact potential, and the presence of aggravating features such as intent to cause indiscriminate harm or engagement in chemical or biological preparations. Mitigating factors such as early acceptance of responsibility or genuine remorse carry weight but, as noted, are here attenuated by the timing of the plea.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

The prosecution has adduced extensive forensic digital evidence revealing sustained efforts by Mr H to acquire dual-use chemicals and components with likely application in explosive devices. The volume and variety of encrypted communications, stored manuals, and technical documentation underline a degree of commitment exceeding impromptu or amateur activity.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Expert testimony from the National Counter Terrorism Explosives Laboratory detailed the potential lethality of devices similar to those described in seized materials, emphasizing consequences in enclosed public environments. These technical expositions, while painstaking, highlight a chilling competence and awareness on the defendant’s part.  

The defence have, however, argued that some of the data folders recovered, notably those labelled with innocuous titles like “HomeHobbies” and “CulinaryExperiments,” contained unrelated content and illustrated legitimate scientific curiosity rather than malign intent. The court appreciates the defence attempt to differentiate between lawful eccentricity and criminal purpose but remains unconvinced in light of corroborating evidence.  

Notably, the presence of a gas mask and several pressure gauges in the flat, as well as handwritten notes concerning blast wave propagation, further authenticate the prosecution’s assertion of methodical preparation.  

Although Mr H’s counsel underscored his prior clean record save for an isolated charge of public order disturbance stemming from a 2017 demonstration, this bears marginal relevance to the terrorism offences under consideration. It is a commonplace for defendants to summon otherwise unrelated youthful indiscretions or minor regulatory breaches in mitigation; the court remains vigilant to the potential for such references to obfuscate the gravity of terrorism offences.   

The court must remark, parenthetically, on the quality of witness testimony throughout the pre-trial phase. Officers from Digital Policing Units evidenced commendable professionalism despite the inherently taxing and confidential nature of their work. Similarly, the Eastwood Community Support Network’s input, especially from caseworker Ms Felicity Ward, provided valuable context about Mr H’s social isolation and previous mental health engagements, the significance of which is explored further in psychological assessments.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

The defendant’s contact history includes a brief sojourn in Cardiff in mid-2023, ostensibly to attend a “workshop” convened by a now-proscribed entity. When that evidence is viewed alongside intercepted encrypted discussions referencing “activation windows” and “cell formation,” it supports the inference of active participation beyond passive consumption of extremist propaganda.   

The quantity of material seized included an unregistered firearm component and heat-resistant gloves, elements neither acquired for innocent hobbies nor capably explained by the defence as incidental artefacts.  

One notes, for completeness, that the defence highlighted Mr H’s involvement in a local theatre group’s amateur production of “Julius Caesar,” arguing that the appeal of political drama evidenced complex but non-criminal motivations. While artistic engagement is laudable and indeed indicative of pro-social community involvement, it cannot be treated as mitigating conduct in the face of explicit plotting for violence.  

Considerable effort went into arranging psychiatric evaluation. Dr Lucia Bennett, consultant forensic psychiatrist, was appointed by the defence and completed a report dated 28 July 2025.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Dr Bennett’s report is meticulously composed and addresses Mr H’s cognitive and affective capacities, his personality traits, and potential vulnerabilities to indoctrination. She noted particular difficulties with rigidity in thinking, but critically, she made no diagnosis of psychosis or significant affective disorder. The assessment concluded that while Mr H exhibited traits collectively termed “extremist ideological fixation,” he retained rational capacity and full criminal responsibility.  

It is worth recalling the seminal Court of Appeal decisions relating to psychiatric mitigation in terrorism sentencing, including R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624 and R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412. Those cases underscore the limited scope for psychiatric disorder to diminish culpability where the offending demonstrates high levels of planning and societal threat. Here, Mr H’s conduct reflected neither impulsivity nor psychotic delusions but was borne of volitional, if maladaptive, commitment.  

The probation service provided a detailed presentence report dated 10 August 2025. The caseworker, Ms Harriet Owens, notes the challenge in constructing an intervention pathway given Mr H’s digital adeptness, social isolation, and proclivity for secrecy. The report also flags the absence of a stable accommodation arrangement post-release as a factor that could exacerbate risk if not properly managed.  

The Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) Category 3 group convened on 11 August 2025 to discuss risk management planning in the event of custody. The group’s minutes reflect consideration of electronic monitoring, licence conditions prohibiting association with identified extremist figures, and structured psychological therapy targeting ideological desistance. The court appreciates the painstaking coordination evident in these multidisciplinary discussions.  

The defendant’s familial circumstances were illuminated by letters from his mother and elder sister. Both manuscripts are thoughtfully composed, expressing sorrow and hope for rehabilitation. The court also acknowledges correspondence submitted by the South Bristol Re-Integration Council, commending efforts to engage Mr H in vocational schemes prior to arrest.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Additionally, financial records indicate an outgoing transfer denominated as cryptocurrency equivalent to £1,825 sent to an anonymous online marketplace, the nature of whose goods is unascertained but suspected to involve dual-use components. Engagement with emerging financial technologies complicates investigative and prosecutorial frameworks, as repeatedly noted in governmental reports on digital finance and illicit trade.  

The prosecuting counsel has ably presented the evidential matrix demonstrating persistent efforts by Mr H to conceal and maximise operational security, underscoring a high degree of sophistication consonant with the upper tiers of culpability as set out in the Sentencing Council’s Guideline.  

Discussions on the burdens shouldered by law enforcement agencies cannot be omitted. The pressures afflicting the Counter Terrorism Units are compounded by fluctuating threat levels and resource reallocation following national emergencies. The forensic digital capacity is often stretched to the brink, as was evident in Mr H’s case, requiring collaboration with overseas agencies and intermittent reliance on academic partnerships for data decryption assistance.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to the defendant’s personal background. Mr H is 28 years old, has no prior convictions save minor driving infractions, and holds a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering. His academic achievements were lauded in references submitted on his behalf, though these are insufficient to mitigate significantly given the deliberate misuse of scientific expertise demonstrated herein. It is also noted that Mr H previously worked in quality control for a pharmaceutical manufacturer but was dismissed following investigation into computer misuse and unauthorised online activity.  

Letters from local community organisations acknowledged the defendant’s prior volunteer work with a youth literacy programme. Nonetheless, the court must emphasise that rehabilitation efforts in unrelated social domains do not diminish the seriousness of offences designed to undermine public safety on a large scale.    

The court further acknowledges the challenges facing rehabilitation services in terrorism cases. While schemes like the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP) offer structured pathways, their completion rates remain modest, with substantial attrition post-release. Licensing authorities consequently face a difficult balancing act between community safety and reintegration.  

The court remains mindful of the broader societal harms wrought by extremist violence, including the chilling impact on communities and the strain placed on victims and emergency services alike. Radicalisation and violent extremism have multifactorial origins, and prevention demands not only law enforcement vigilance but also nuanced social and psychological interventions.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

In summary, the offending conduct in this matter was marked by methodical planning, technical sophistication, and intent to cause indiscriminate harm. The aggravating factors include the defendant’s use of encrypted communication platforms, procurement of weapons components, and ostensible efforts to evade detection. Mitigating factors are restricted to his youth, absence of previous convictions relating to terrorism or violence, and eventual, though late, guilty plea.  

Given the gravity of the offences and the pressing need for public protection and deterrence, the court considers that a substantial custodial sentence is warranted. However, prior to finalising sentence, it is essential that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared. This report must include an assessment of risk of serious harm, consideration of possible interventions, and proposals for custodial and community management on release.  

I would encourage the probation service to explore possibilities for involvement with specialist psychological support frameworks, the feasibility of electronic monitoring, and the requirement for post-release restrictions consistent with the principles of proportionality and necessity.  

My thanks go to the prosecuting counsel, Ms Emily Waters, for her clear and detailed submissions, and to Mr Thomas Keane, who represents the defendant under a current Legal Aid grant of assistance. Both have conducted themselves professionally throughout what has been a procedurally complex matter. The court also acknowledges the contributions of all agencies involved in safeguarding efforts, evidence gathering, and assessment, including those who operate beyond the public gaze.  

This court adjourns sentencing for a short period until 8 September 2025 to receive the pre-sentence report and any supplementary representations.  

These sentencing remarks have been issued today, 18 August 2025, in Court 5 at Bristol Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules, and a formal record will be maintained.  

The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
