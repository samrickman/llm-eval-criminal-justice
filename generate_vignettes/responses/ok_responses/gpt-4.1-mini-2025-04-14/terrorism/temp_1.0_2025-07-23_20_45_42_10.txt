IN THE CROWN COURT AT NOTTINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. N2025/29845  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge J. C. WINTHER  
Filed: 15 October 2025

Mr H appears before this court for sentence in respect of offences contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, and a further offence under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000, relating to possession of articles for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism. The conduct charged spans from the summer of 2023 through to his arrest in early 2025.

The defendant was first taken into custody in the early hours of 9 February 2025 on the execution of a warrant issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residence in Beeston, Nottinghamshire. The operation was precipitated by intelligence obtained via the coordination of Counter Terrorism Policing East Midlands and the Security Service, with extended input from the National Cyber Crime Unit, who had been monitoring encrypted communications linked by digital footprints to Mr H. At the time of arrest, a significant quantity of electronic devices, including several encrypted mobile telephones and a portable data server, were seized, being subject to forensic examination thereafter.

The background to these proceedings necessitates some preliminary observations about the contemporary operational landscape within which such investigations are conducted. Counter terrorism investigations are carried out against a backdrop of chronic underfunding, competing priorities, and the ever-increasing complexities of encrypted communication platforms. The case exhibits features familiar to those experienced in this realm: the intersection of digital forensic analysis, multi-agency coordination, and the challenge of balancing intelligence-led policing with statutory safeguards grounded in the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.

It is, regrettably, noted that administrative processes relating to early disclosure were markedly protracted in this case, occasioning brief adjournments. The court is reminded that these delays, while frustrating, arise not out of negligence but from the sheer volume and sensitivity of material under consideration. The spectrum of protected material encompasses intercept warrants, warrants for equipment interference under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, and third-party material redacted to preserve innocent parties. The courts must tread cautiously between ensuring the defendant’s right to a fair trial and the legitimate public interest in safeguarding methods and personnel.

Prior to his arrest, Mr H had, as the court notes, been the subject of a Prevent referral initiated in late 2021 following concerns raised by a youth employment scheme manager. The referral resulted in participation in a Channel programme over several months in early 2022. Documentation from the Calverton Prevent Hub indicates that his engagement with support measures was intermittent and ultimately unsuccessful in redirecting his trajectory. Despite this, the court was provided with correspondence from volunteer mentors and community groups attesting to Mr H’s occasional efforts at social engagement, underscoring that the challenges of intervention in such cases remain formidable.

The matter first came before this court at a case management hearing on 12 March 2025, presided over by Her Honour Judge Edwards. At that stage, the defendant entered pleas of not guilty to all charges. The prosecution duly served expert witness statements, including digital forensics analyses and linguistic profiling reports, which added considerable forensic weight to the evidence. The trial was listed and commenced on 11 September 2025, continuing for two weeks before the defendant entered guilty pleas to all charges on 23 September 2025, foreclosing the need for a jury verdict.

It is an unfortunate reality, as this court frequently observes, that pleas of guilty in serious terrorism cases are often entered when the evidential case is overwhelming and only after prolonged and expensive litigation proceedings. While the law permits and encourages credit for guilty pleas, the timing of such pleas remains a critical factor. The well-established principles set out in R v. Brown [2011] EWCA Crim 526 apply: significant credit is reserved for early pleas which demonstrably assist the administration of justice by avoiding protracted trials and sparing victims from the distress of giving evidence. Pleas tendered late, and without genuine contrition, attract reduced mitigation.

It is also appropriate to refer to R v. Doyle [2017] EWCA Crim 522, which reminded courts that a plea entered on the first day of trial at the eleventh hour may warrant a discount of no more than 10 to 15 per cent, depending on the circumstances. In line with these authorities, the credit applicable to the defendant’s pleas is accordingly limited.

In considering appropriate sentence, the court is guided by the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Terrorism Offences (2023), which emphasises the paramount importance of public protection, the deterrent effect of sentencing, and the need to reflect the gravity of offending aimed at undermining societal cohesion. Particular attention must be paid to culpability, degree of planning, sophistication, and the likelihood of actual harm or intended harm had the preparation not been interrupted.

It is of note that the court hears from both the forensic psychiatric report prepared pursuant to a section 35 Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991 direction and a supplementary risk assessment. The independent forensic psychiatrist, Dr S. Malik, notes that the defendant demonstrates obsessive ruminative tendencies but diagnoses no formal psychotic disorder. Her report articulates concerns regarding cognitive rigidity and fixed belief patterns consistent with ideological fixation. Though Mr H has expressed some willingness to engage in cognitive behavioural therapy, Dr Malik remains cautious as to the prospects of genuine ideological disengagement absent sustained and compulsory intervention.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

Mr H’s case unfolds in the context of increasing pressure on both policing and health services. The East Midlands forensic mental health service is operating at near-full capacity, with waiting lists in excess of six months. Probation services continue to grapple with chronic staff shortages, high caseloads, and the complex mandate of managing Category 3 terrorism-related offenders. That these systemic pressures impact the speed and quality of post-custodial risk management plans is a reality that cannot be ignored.

The prosecuting counsel, Miss Olivia Talbot, provides a detailed outline of the Crown’s evidence, highlighting the volume and sophistication of digital materials examined. Much of the evidential weight rests on recovery of encrypted files portraying instruction manuals for the assembly of explosive devices, as well as encrypted chat histories reflecting contacts with individuals on the home watchlist.

The court expresses gratitude to the defence counsel, Mr Edward Greaves, for his thorough and professional representation, particularly given the complexities imposed by extensive digital material and the challenges of negotiating with the Legal Aid Agency, whose delays in approving additional funding for forensic experts has regrettably prolonged proceedings.

Among various peripheral matters, the court has noted repeated references in the defence submissions to the defendant's occasional volunteer involvement with the Nottingham Woodland Conservation Trust, as well as membership in a local cricket club. While such activities may illustrate some breadth of social interaction, they do little to affect culpability or mitigate risk in this context.

It is also relevant, though not dispositive, that the defendant’s father is engaged in ongoing proceedings relating to historic financial offences. These proceedings bear no direct relation to the current matter, but their existence has been cited to characterise the household environment. The court exercises caution against allowing collateral family matters to distract from the specifics of the offending at hand.

Among the procedural matters addressed during the course of the trial was an application to admit evidence relating to the knife possession of a co-defendant, who was separately prosecuted for affray, having allegedly assaulted arresting officers with a chair. That evidence was ruled inadmissible as irrelevant to Mr H’s conduct.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

The court acknowledges for completeness that multiple prior convictions dating back over a decade for low-level shoplifting and criminal damage to public transport property were referenced by the defence as indicators of a troubled youth but bear no direct relationship to the terrorism offences before the court. It is well established that such antecedents, while relevant in contextualising character, do not in themselves predict risk in terrorism-related offending.

Separately, this court is reminded of the protracted legal wrangling surrounding disclosure obligations, exacerbated by intermittent strike action within the staff of the Crown Prosecution Service Digital Evidence Unit, which caused delays in the production of forensic reports in the early phase of proceedings.

The defendant’s handwritten letters to the court, described by counsel as “measured and reflective,” were duly considered. Their tone suggests awareness of the gravity of the situation but stops short of expressing genuine remorse or contrition.

At an earlier hearing, the court was provided with a report from Dr Elaine Roscoe, a clinical psychologist specialising in cognitive rigidity and extremist thinking patterns. Her conclusion echoed similar themes of limited amenability to voluntary interventions absent a coercive framework.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

Evaluation of risk of reoffending is complicated by limited engagement with structured rehabilitation programmes during the defendant’s extended remand period. The National Probation Service Risk Management Team has advised that, in the event of release, stringent licence conditions including electronic monitoring and restricted internet access would be required.

It is worth remarking on the social context in which this case unfolds. Our urban centres have witnessed rising levels of visible antisocial behaviour, from aggressive begging to minor street disorder. While wholly distinct in nature from terrorist offending, the cumulative strain on police and social services alike must be borne in mind when assessing the resources necessary for ongoing supervision and containment.

Attention is also drawn to the legacy of contentious use of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 in crowd control policies during demonstrations, enacted in part to underscore state capability to manage public order but criticized for its disproportionate effect on marginalised communities.

The evidential process included review of CCTV from local markets, which showed Mr H loitering in proximity to a transport hub. While this might seem a routine observation, in this case it tied into encrypted messaging discussing critical transport nodes, underpinning the concerns of counter-terrorism officers.

It has not escaped this court’s notice that, unrelated to this case, a major arson incident at Court 4 of this building complex several months prior delayed proceedings in other matters, underscoring infrastructure vulnerabilities that impact the administration of justice.

Detailed financial investigation revealed a cryptocurrency transfer linked to an online extremist fundraising platform. This, too, underscores the multifaceted nature of modern terrorism investigations involving complex transactional obfuscation and international jurisdictional challenges.

It is instructive, in this connection, to recall the observations made in R v. Charani [2019] EWCA Crim 1123, where the Court underscored the growing prevalence of cryptocurrency usage in funding illegal activity and the attendant difficulties in enforcement and evidential proof. Such technological evolutions require the courts to remain vigilant and responsive.

The court also acknowledges input from local charitable organisations, including the Nottingham Resettlement Project, which while not specialising in de-radicalisation work, provide ancillary support for social reintegration, highlighting the multi-layered nature of rehabilitation.

The Crown has been assisted by officers of the Digital Investigation Unit, whose forensic workload is reportedly at record levels, handling over 300 active terrorism related cases nationwide, a statistic that illustrates the considerable strain on law enforcement’s technical capacities.

Turning to the personal circumstances of Mr H: aged 30, college educated to degree level, and formerly employed as a CAD technician, he has no previous convictions for violent crime or terrorism related offences. A reference from a former employer describes him as “competent and reserved, with no indication of extremist leanings.”

Letters of character and support from community football coaches and book club coordinators have been submitted, detailing Mr H’s intermittent participation in socially constructive activities.

A probation officer’s report indicates that the defendant’s family dynamic is fractious, with estrangement from his mother and strained relations with a sibling subject to unrelated criminal proceedings.

Psychological assessment confirms a degree of cognitive inflexibility and a temperament inclined towards perfectionism, but no mitigating factors of diminished responsibility arise.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

The Report and Risk Assessment emphasise the high probability of continued ideological motivation and a propensity towards isolation from mainstream society, warning that, absent significant custodial time and post-release supervision, the risk to public safety remains substantial.

In considering both aggravating and mitigating factors, the court notes the absence of prior convictions and some measure of educational achievement weigh lightly in mitigation, against the substantial premeditation, access to digital extremist content, and the clear potential for serious harm.

The court invites probation to prepare a full pre-sentence report addressing suitability for extended custodial sentence, the applicability of Serious Further Offence provisions, and possible frameworks for post-release management involving multi-agency cooperation including mental health services and specialised deradicalisation programmes.

The strain on public services anticipated upon the defendant’s release is acute, given ongoing pressures across custodial and community supervision domains, and the persistent difficulties in resourcing bespoke interventions.

It is worth acknowledging the professionalism and dedication of all officers, health workers, and civil servants engaged in this matter, who operate under considerable operational and political pressures.

The court, while mindful of the need for individualised justice, must weigh most heavily the imperatives of protection and deterrence, and the clear evidence of culpability presented.

These sentencing remarks are accordingly issued this day, 15 October 2025, in Court 9 at Nottingham Crown Court. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentencing hearing is adjourned pending receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further representations from the parties.

These are the orders of the court.
