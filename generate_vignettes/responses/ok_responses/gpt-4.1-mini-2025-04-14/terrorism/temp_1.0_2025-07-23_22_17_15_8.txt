IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/27849  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. Fenwick  
Filed: 4 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this Honourable Court for sentence following his conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for use in connection with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences relate to actions alleged to have occurred between October 2022 and his arrest in March 2025.  

Mr H was arrested at 04:45 on 15 March 2025, pursuant to an operation led by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). Search warrants issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 were executed at his residential address at 27 Newcourt Avenue, Stoke Bishop, Bristol. The information triggering these powers derived from Security Service interception showing encrypted exchanges between accounts linked to Mr H and known extremist forums hosted on the dark web. Equipment seized included a decommissioned laptop, two external hard drives, and a 3D printer frame without electronic components.

The accumulation and analysis of electronic evidence were impeded by Mr H’s use of sophisticated obfuscation technologies, including the deployment of Tor routing and ephemeral encrypted messaging platforms. The National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC), in collaboration with CTPSW digital teams, undertook a lengthy decryption exercise, which was complicated by intermittent counter-surveillance by the defendant. The logistics of assembling multi-source intelligence highlighted the continuing challenge posed by the speed of technological advancement and constraints upon governmental resources.  

It bears reflecting that the Court notes a similar modus operandi in R v. Askari [2018] EWCA Crim 2746, where the defendant employed advanced encryption to mask coordination efforts, resulting in prolonged investigatory periods and the need for forensic expertise beyond standard police digital capabilities. While the facts diverge materially in terms of target and scale, the overlap in method underscores a continuing evolutionary trend in terrorist preparatory conduct.  

In an ancillary matter, it is pertinent to record that Mr H’s case coincided with the trial of a co-defendant, Mr S, on charges of possession of a bladed article with intent to harm, following an incident at a city centre licensed premises. Mr S was remanded pending sentencing but has no connection to the offences for which Mr H is accountable in these proceedings. Similarly, it is noted that the landlord of 27 Newcourt Avenue was surveyed recently as part of an unrelated council noise abatement investigation after complaints concerning loud parties—an investigative strand extraneous to the case before this Court.  

Early stages of proceedings suffered delay due to Legal Aid Agency (LAA) procedural hurdles, with defence counsel applying multiple times before receiving authority to instruct independent digital forensic experts. Such delays, regrettably, are not uncommon and place an undue strain on the efficient management of cases of this nature. Recognition is made of the commendable professionalism with which Mr H’s solicitors have sought, and ultimately secured, necessary expert engagement despite these systemic frustrations.  

In addition to these procedural complexities, the Court gratefully acknowledges the written submissions provided by the East Bristol Refugee Support Network, which, although dealing primarily with unrelated immigration concerns, offered limited insight into the defendant’s engagement with community volunteers during fleeting periods of housing instability in 2021. Their letter speaks to broader societal challenges, though it cannot be afforded mitigating weight here.  

Concerns about knife crime in the Bristol city centre area remain high, with recent prosecutions—including a case involving a juvenile offender found guilty of affray with the use of a pool cue during a local pub altercation—as reported in R v. Finlan [2025]. While this is not relevant to Mr H’s conduct, its mention serves to place the overall law enforcement climate in fuller context, illustrating the multiple layers of criminality that currently occupy police attention.  

Further procedural background includes the attendance of the multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) panel convened on 14 April 2025, chaired by the Regional Probation Service, who provided preliminary risk management proposals pending sentencing. The MAPPA panel comprises representatives from CTPSW, the NHS Forensic Psychiatry Service, the local authority safeguarding team, and housing officers from the Bristol City Council’s Resettlement Unit. Their coordinated efforts are to be commended in a context where interagency collaboration often suffers due to budgetary pressures and competing demands.  

At an administrative hearing in July 2025, the Court was provided with character references from two community organisations: the Greenfield Allotments Association and the Avon and Somerset Wildlife Trust. Both organisations praised the defendant’s contribution to community tree planting initiatives during 2020 and 2021, a fact heralded as positive character evidence by the defence. The Court records, however, that such public-spirited activities, while laudable in their own right, must be balanced against the gravity and nature of the offending before us.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

To turn to the substantive issue, the Crown relies upon evidence indicating that Mr H maintained an encrypted blog which gradually evolved from unremarkable entries on local environmental activism to explicit ideological expressions advocating the overthrow of the constitutional order and justification of indiscriminate violence. Analysis by linguistic experts engaged by the prosecution pointed to repeated references consistent with known extremist narratives and shared language patterns from proscribed terror organisations. The Court notes that the defence contested these interpretations as subjective and inconclusive.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Further digital forensics uncovered numerous files within hidden encrypted containers, including documents detailing improvised chemical detonator assembly, the modification of commercial drones for use as remote-triggered delivery devices, and various technical manuals on explosive materials redistribution. Defence submissions contended that some files were incomplete or corrupted, indicative of experimental rather than operable constructs. The Court must consider the totality of evidence to infer intent and capacity.  

Of note, the Court references R v. Mahdi [2017] EWCA Crim 2345, where partial possession of bomb-making instructions, combined with active plans to cause harm, sufficed to confirm preparatory offence liability. Although the present case spans a longer timeframe, and some materials were inchoate, the possession of multiple reliable sources for dangerous materials cannot be dismissed lightly.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Counsel for the defence put forward the argument that Mr H’s interest in aeronautical devices, including drone kits, was consistent with his undergraduate studies in computer science and hobbyist drone photography. This was supported by submission of a printout of a 2020 university project on unmanned aerial vehicles. The Court has considered this material but finds no credible explanation under which the duplication of such devices would coincide with extremist preparatory conduct.  

Correspondence from Mr H’s previous employer, Brightwell Innovations, describes the defendant as “a diligent employee with a particular aptitude for algorithmic programming,” but notes his sudden and unexplained resignation in early 2023 after an internal inquiry into unauthorised access to encrypted messaging applications on the work network. This background, while not directly relevant to offending, may be noted as indicative of a gradual pathway towards illicit activity.  

The Court notes a separate and unrelated prosecution in the Bristol Crown Court recently involving Mr F, a local resident charged with fly-tipping on protected green belt land, resulting in significant environmental damage. Mr F was sentenced to a community order with a rehabilitation requirement. This is not connected to the offences under consideration here but reflects the broader enforcement environment within which the Court operates.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The Crown also presented evidence of Mr H’s international travel during May 2024, including visits to Istanbul and Sofia. Flight manifests and CCTV footage from Istanbul Atatürk Airport depicted him in the vicinity of known centres for extremist gatherings, as referenced in a foreign intelligence report admitted as evidence. Defence urged the Court to accept Mr H’s explanation of attending regional computer science conferences and sightseeing tours. The Court remains satisfied, based on the evidence as a whole, that these movements were part of risk escalation.  

Acknowledgment must be given to the efforts of the Defence team led by Mr Nicholas Redfern, who demonstrated commendable diligence in cross-examination of prosecution witnesses and in navigating complex disclosure protocols. The Court, however, regrets the less-than-optimal timeliness of disclosure by the prosecution, stemming from the voluminous and sensitive nature of the material handled by the Joint Operations Security Unit (JOSU). It is recognised that these issues emerge frequently in terrorism cases, with disclosure vetting impeded by redaction demands and national security considerations. Such delays, while frustrating, are factored into procedural expectations in this jurisdiction.  

The Court further notes that the sentencing guidelines which inform this Court’s approach are those promulgated by the Sentencing Council in November 2023 concerning terrorism offenders. The guidelines emphasise the necessity of proportionate sentences that address the dual aims of punishment and deterrence, whilst considering rehabilitation prospects specific to the ideological and technical sophistication of offenders. Case authorities such as R v. Farooq [2024] EWCA Crim 356 and R v. Nicholson [2023] EWCA Crim 1257 provide instructive precedents on the calibration of custodial terms contingent upon the level of operational capability demonstrated by the defendant.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Investigations by financial forensics revealed several cryptocurrency transactions traced to wallets controlled by Mr H, including payments aggregating to approximately £3,200 exchanged via privacy-enhancing tumblers to darknet suppliers specialising in dual-use chemicals. The Crown contends this financial trail supports the hypothesis of material procurement intent. The use of anonymising mixers poses ongoing challenges to enforcement agencies, which are reflected in recent Home Office working papers warning that without legislative enhancement, prosecution and interdiction will remain complicated.  

In a less directly related matter, the Court is informed that a local probation officer involved in monitoring a MAPPA Category 3 offender was recently arrested on charges unconnected to Mr H, namely contempt of court and corruption allegations. This has no bearing on the current proceedings but is mentioned here to underline the institutional challenges in managing offender supervision effectively amidst operational disruptions.  

Extensive CCTV footage from a quiet riverside park on 18 November 2024 shows the defendant engaging in nocturnal activities, including apparent reconnaissance of structural weaknesses in public utilities infrastructure. These recordings required the collaboration of several CCTV operators, many of whom work under increasingly stretched conditions due to widespread cuts in police budgets. The delay in obtaining and interpreting this footage exemplifies the imbalance between resource allocation and investigative demand.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to the personal circumstances of Mr H, he is currently aged 31, with a background indicating academic attainment up to undergraduate degree level in computer science at the University of Exeter. His academic transcript highlights strengths in algorithm development but also notes incidents of disruptive behaviour and non-compliance with university conduct codes. Character references encompass endorsements from a local environmental gardening collective where he was active in community projects during 2019 and early 2020.  

The defendant has submitted handwritten letters to the Court displaying coherent, polite, and reflective prose, though devoid of explicit remorse for the offences. Psychological assessment reports, including the most recent dated 28 August 2025 authored by Dr Philip Renwick, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, indicate that Mr H shows tendencies towards cognitive rigidity, black-and-white thinking, and expressed adherence to extremist ideology despite some ambivalence in interview. The report concludes there is a high risk of serious harm in the event of release absent rigorous supervision, though no diagnosable psychiatric disorder is present.  

The probation service, while noting ongoing capacity issues in offender management, has confirmed that arrangements for dedicated supervision following possible release exist, including invitation to participate in the regional terrorism-focused Desistance Programme. Completion rates for such programmes, as acknowledged in the recent HM Inspectorate of Probation thematic report, tend notoriously to falter beyond the initial engagement phase. The Court urges that any such interventions be viewed cautiously as mitigating factors only.  

Finally, the Court has received submissions from the Bristol Prevent Partnership, which detailed the history of intervention efforts with Mr H through Channel frameworks starting in 2020. Although some limited engagement was recorded, overall participation was sporadic and marked by frequent disengagement. The caseworker’s report included concerns about Mr H’s increasing withdrawal and cryptic online postings which escalated into explicit advocacy of violence during the two years preceding arrest.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

On the totality of the evidence, the Court is compelled to find that the defendant was engaged in an overt programme of preparations and acquisition of materials and knowledge aimed at the perpetration of indiscriminate terrorist acts. The sophistication and persistence displayed withstand attempts to portray the activities as academic curiosity or benign hobbyism. The aggravating features are manifest: thematic commitment to extremist ideology, the use of encrypted technology to evade detection, international travel for ideologically connected purposes, and tangible financial transactions to procure dual-use materials.  

Mitigating features are limited to the absence of previous convictions, some evidence of occasional pro-social conduct, and the late, but genuine, guilty plea entered at the door of trial. The plea cannot attract more than modest credit given its timing after full disclosure and extensive pre-trial preparation.  

In accordance with the Terrorism Act 2006 sentencing statutory framework and relevant case law including R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, the paramount consideration remains public protection coupled with the need for deterrence both general and specific. This offence carries a maximum life sentence, and this Court must carefully balance all factors to reflect the severity of the conduct and risk presented.  

The Court directs the compilation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report by the Regional Probation Service. The report is to address: the defendant’s risk of reoffending, suitability for specific Cognitive Behavioural Therapy modules adapted to extremist cognitions, potential for participation in extended licence supervision including GPS monitoring, and capacity for structured reintegration via approved premises. Treatment prospects and any relevant mental health interventions should be rigorously evaluated with input from forensic psychiatric services.  

Sentencing is accordingly adjourned to a date to be fixed, pending receipt of the pre-sentence report and any further representations. I thank counsel for their submissions and their professionalism in advance of the sentencing hearing. The Court also notes with appreciation the work of the staff of CTPSW, the National Technical Assistance Centre, and the multi-agency public protection panel whose coordinated efforts have been essential in managing the complex risks inherent in this case.  

These sentencing remarks are pronounced this day, 4 September 2025, in Court 9 at Bristol Crown Court. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal conviction and sentence within the statutory time limit specified under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
