IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/32956  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. J. Penrose  
Filed: 4 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence on two counts: first, engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; and second, possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. These offences are alleged to have occurred between October 2023 and the defendant’s arrest in April 2025.  

This court was established in 1972 and has jurisdiction in the South West Circuit. It hears serious cases, including those involving terrorism-related matters subject to specialized security considerations and procedural adaptations. The sensitive nature of such cases necessitates careful management to balance principles of open justice against national security imperatives.  

The defendant was arrested at 0459 hours on 17 April 2025, following a warrant executed by officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) at a flat located on the third floor of a residential block in Lower King Street. The warrant was issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, based on intercept material and intelligence relating to encrypted communications attributed to the defendant’s online pseudonym “IronForge.” On arrest, the officers seized a laptop, two encrypted external hard drives, an assortment of electronic components labelled “Project Ignition,” and several books pertaining to pyrotechnics and explosives.

Prior to arrest, this matter was the subject of Operation CURRENCY, a multi-agency investigation spanning six months. It incorporated traditional investigative methods, including electronic surveillance, analysis of transport records, and digital forensics. The investigation faced significant challenges due to the defendant’s use of anonymising software, layered encryption, and the utilisation of multiple virtual private networks. The court acknowledges the painstaking work of cybercrime analysts whose expert testimony detailed the hurdles posed by such sophisticated digital tradecraft.  

As a procedural note, this case experienced delays attributable to the Legal Aid Agency’s administrative procedures regarding funding approval for expert witnesses. The defence’s initial request to instruct an independent digital forensic specialist was submitted on 4 June 2025 but was not authorised until 28 July 2025 due to bureaucratic delays. Such delays inevitably complicate timely preparation and risk adversely impacting defence rights. The court reiterates its concerns at the frequency of such occurrences in terrorism-related matters, underscoring the pressing need for resource and procedural reform.  

The defendant initially pleaded not guilty at the first hearing on 21 May 2025. Subsequently, on the morning of the sentencing hearing, Mr H altered his plea to guilty on both counts. This eleventh-hour admission limits the credit for plea available in this matter. The court directs attention to the principles discussed in R v Morecambe [2019] EWCA Crim 1142, which made clear that credit for plea is diminished where the plea is appropriately timely but not in the earliest stages of proceedings. This jurisprudence balances incentives for early admission with the realities of complex prosecutions.  

It is of note that the Crown respected the defendant’s right to contest the charges through appropriate disclosure and case management, in accordance with Better Case Management (BCM) directives. The comprehensive disclosure package comprised 912 standard digital exhibits and 23 volumes of secure closed material, consistent with the requirements of section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013. Defence counsel, Ms Evelyn Crane, is due formal acknowledgement of her rigorous and professional representation despite such procedural and evidential complexity.  

It is not for this court to comment on operational policing methods beyond the procedural and evidential context; however, the investigation revealed strains on the CTPSW unit, which currently operates with a vacancy rate exceeding 20% and faces increasing cyber-technical caseloads. The dedication of the officers involved in the sustained surveillance and data analysis is commendable, notwithstanding the inevitable challenges of fatigue and resource allocation.  

The prosecution called Detective Inspector James Bell, who provided an overview of activity logs, metadata reconstruction, and mobile phone extraction. He commented on the escalating reliance within policing on cross-sector partnerships, including commercial telecommunications providers, whose compliance with judicial warrants is critical despite competing concerns over privacy and customer trust. The court acknowledges the collaborative efforts across agencies and the delicate balances such work strikes.  

A plea and trial preparation hearing was held on 30 June 2025, during which the defendant maintained his plea of not guilty. The Crown outlined its case, emphasizing the sophistication and apparent premeditation evidenced in the digital artefacts recovered. Defence submissions conceded that certain components of the material were difficult to explain in innocent terms but invited the court to consider alternative motives and contexts for the defendant’s possession of particular items and manuals.

This court notes precedent relevant to technological sophistication in terrorism cases, notably R v Sheppard [2020] EWCA Crim 1334, which underscored that possession of digital constructs and artifacts indicative of preparation may evidence intent but must be evaluated in the wider factual matrix. Sheppard involved a defendant who constructed a rudimentary detonator using readily available household materials and digital instructions gleaned from online forums. The Court of Appeal observed that the presence of incomplete or draft documents did not necessarily diminish culpability.  

Consideration must also be given to the varied and complex nature of radicalisation pathways. Channel referrals operate as a crucial stage in early identification and support but, regrettably, such interventions are not infallible. In this matter, a Prevent referral was made in late 2022 following concerns expressed by a university lecturer regarding extremist postings by Mr H on a now-defunct social media platform. The referral terminated after six months due to non-engagement, a common challenge in the counter-radicalisation field. The Calderside Prevent Hub, which managed the case, confirmed in its 2024 written submission to the court that their efforts, while diligent, were ultimately unsuccessful in diverting the defendant from his trajectory.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The court is mindful of the broader context of public safety. The normalisation of antisocial conduct, ranging from increased street begging to the vandalism of public transport infrastructure, presents persistent challenges to frontline services. These societal stresses exacerbate the pressures on policing and social care resources, though such factors bear no mitigating weight in the determination of culpability for terrorism offences. It remains the duty of this court to address unlawful conduct with due rigour and proportionality.  

A further significant element of this case was the defendant’s access to a 3D printer discovered during searches. This included components and blueprints for a device capable of producing ball-bearing projectiles dispersed by an explosive mechanism. Defence counsel was at pains to submit that the use of 3D printers in domestic settings is widespread, often for wholly innocuous craft and repair purposes, a fact indisputable in modern households and educational settings. Nonetheless, in light of the defendant’s other conduct, the court finds no credible innocent explanation for the presence and specific modifications observed.

The court also acknowledges correspondence received from the South Bristol Foodmakers Cooperative, an organisation noting Mr H’s periodic volunteering efforts. While such community engagement is praiseworthy, it neither negates nor detracts from the seriousness of the offences charged and proven. Similarly, the Easton Housing Association submitted a brief attesting to the defendant’s compliance with tenancy obligations and absence of nuisance complaints, although this is of limited relevance to the risk presented by his offending.  

Reference is made to the co-defendant in the associated Operation SILVERWOOD investigation, who failed to appear for trial and remains at large following an alleged assault on arresting officers using a metal chair in a fit of violence unrelated to Mr H’s conduct. This court is cautious not to impose guilt by association or conflate distinct acts between parties associated only by investigation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

As to financial matters, the investigation unearthed cryptocurrency transactions traced to Mr H, including transfers totalling £3,200 from a wallet linked to the alias “forgefire” to a darknet vendor specialising in dual-use chemicals. The forensic accounting expert, Ms Alison Trelawney, detailed in her report the challenges inherent in tracing such cryptocurrency flows, which are often convoluted by the use of mixers and tumblers designed to anonymize transactions. The prosecution argues, convincingly, that such financial activity evidences a level of premeditation and sophistication beyond amateur experimentation.  

In terms of sentencing guidelines, the Court gives due weight to the Sentencing Council’s 2023 recommendations for terrorism offences. The defendant’s conduct is assessed under Category 1, highest culpability, given the planning nature, sophistication, and potential for indiscriminate harm. Prior case law including R v Khan [2021] EWCA Crim 888 confirms the necessity for sentences reflecting deterrence, public protection, and denunciation where offences involve advanced planning and multi-vector preparation.  

The defendant was born in 1996 and holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from a well-regarded university. His former employer, Bristol Microelectronics, described him as “technically adept, precise, and punctual,” though noted an unexplained resignation coinciding roughly with the onset of the radicalising activity traced in this investigation.  

Correspondence from acquaintances detailed his amateur involvement in local history societies and model railway clubs — interests at odds with his later activities. It is pertinent to observe that personal hobbies, however benign or constructive, provide no justification nor explanation for involvement in terrorism offences.

Psychiatric assessment was carried out by Dr Luisa Hammond, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who found no evidence of a formal mental disorder. She noted “rigid ideological thinking” and marked cognitive rigidity, but no diagnosable psychosis or personality disorder. The assessment emphasised the defendant’s capacity to distinguish right from wrong and comprehend the consequences of his actions, reinforcing culpability and risk assessments of ongoing extremist engagement without stringent intervention.  

The defence has called for consideration of structured disengagement programmes, specifically mentioning the Desistance and Disengagement Pilot Scheme (DDPS). While such initiatives hold promise, particularly when integrated with multi-agency supervision, the court notes the relatively high attrition rates and the absence of an effective one-size-fits-all solution. The evidence persuades the court that release without robust monitoring and psychological support carries a significant risk to public safety.  

The defendant’s conduct must be juxtaposed against the increasing strain on public services. The Probation Service, facing record caseloads with a vacancy rate of approximately 15% nationally, struggles to provide intensive supervision particularly for high-risk terrorism cases. In this context, community resources stretching from housing provision to mental health support are markedly overstretched. Such systemic pressures compound the challenge of managing offenders such as Mr H post-custody.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Mr H’s family has submitted character references and letters expressing shock and regret. A letter from his mother, Ms Janet H., was read aloud at oral submissions, presenting a heartfelt but ultimately unpersuasive plea for mercy grounded in his prior good character and the hope of rehabilitation. The eventual sentence must, however, reflect public protection imperatives over personal sympathy.  

The court notes with regret the court usher, Mr Philip James, was delayed in his attendance owing to a last-minute requirement elsewhere in the building. The courtroom seating and AV equipment had recently undergone refurbishment at considerable public expense designed to modernize facilities for the conduct of future high-profile and secure trials such as this. These improvements, however, do little to diminish the gravity of the offences or to lessen the custodial requirement likely to follow.  

In the course of the investigation, a forensic examination of Mr H’s mobile phone recovered deleted messages encrypted on Signal, thus requiring considerable effort by the National Cyber Crime Unit. The workload faced by such units is immense, with case backlogs frequently exceeding six months. This investigative delay has become commonplace and reflects broader challenges in law enforcement’s technological capabilities.  

Professor Amanda Clarke, an expert in behavioural criminology, contributed a detailed psychological profile, concluding that Mr H exhibited “elevated cognitive rigidity and a propensity for absolutist moral reasoning," findings consistent with prior assessments by Dr Hammond. The risk of recidivism without appropriate intervention was assessed as high.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The court acknowledges the tireless work of volunteers and staff at the Bristol Counter-Extremism Support Network. Their correspondence demonstrates ongoing attempts at engagement with the defendant prior to his arrest, including offers of mentoring and educational resources. Though ultimately unsuccessful, their professionalism and persistence in an underfunded environment deserve recognition.  

In conclusion, this was a carefully orchestrated, deliberate, and deeply concerning enterprise undertaken with knowledge of legal prohibition and potential consequences. The aggravating features warrant the heaviest custodial sentence or a sentence of significant length within the statutory framework. Mitigation is limited to the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, educational attainment, and a plea of guilty offered late in the day but nevertheless admissible as a positive indication.  

A pre-sentence report is to be commissioned forthwith. The probation service is directed to consider the applicability of an Extended Determinate Sentence pursuant to section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The report should further evaluate the feasibility of multi-agency management including electronic monitoring, mandatory polygraph tests, and ongoing psychological care in secure conditions or on licence. High-intensity cognitive behaviour interventions must be explored, recognizing the limits of rehabilitative certainty in these circumstances.  

These sentencing remarks are delivered this fourth day of September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal conviction and sentence will be duly transmitted to relevant authorities for registration and enforcement action. The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal pursuant to section 29 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 within 28 days of sentencing. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this case. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
