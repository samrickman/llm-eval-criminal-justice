IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/19847  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge A. J. TEMPLETON  
Filed: 26 August 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence on charges of preparing acts of terrorism pursuant to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences span a period commencing in January 2023 culminating in Mr H’s arrest on 15 February 2025.

The circumstances of the defendant’s apprehension reflect a substantial inter-agency endeavour involving Counter-Terrorism Policing South West, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and intelligence inputs from the Security Service. The investigation was complex, prolonged, and demanded the marshaling of both traditional human intelligence and advanced technical capabilities, including real-time traffic analysis and decryption efforts focused upon encrypted communication platforms.

Prior to trial, the court observed several procedural interruptions attributable to delays in the processing of disclosure materials, some of which were occasioned by the increased operational demands placed on the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism Division and supporting forensic teams. The court notes, with regret, the impact these administrative lags impose upon judicial timetabling and the burden upon defendants’ rights to expeditious proceedings. Nonetheless, these delays did not prejudice the defendant’s ability to prepare his defence adequately.

The defendant’s legal representation was provided throughout by Mr Julian Marks, instructed under a Legal Aid Agency funding agreement. This court must register its persistent concern with the chronic inadequacies of Legal Aid administration in complex cases such as the present. Notably, the delay in authorising the instruction of a forensic linguistic expert, requested early in the proceedings, occasioned protracted consultation and necessitated multiple adjournments, including a temporary vacating of the listed sentencing date originally fixed for 12 August 2025.

The Crown prosecution team have been led throughout by Miss Rosanna Greene, whose written and oral submissions struck a professional and measured tone consistent with the serious nature of these offences. The court is conscious of the challenges inherent in prosecuting politically charged and ideologically motivated offending where the victims are often abstract rather than identifiable individuals.

A Channel Programme referral was made in 2020 following concerns raised by a college lecturer concerning the defendant’s radicalising statements observed in essays submitted in a module on international relations. That referral concluded with a finding of insufficient cause for further intervention at that juncture. While the hindsight lens offers critical perspective, the court is mindful that early intervention frameworks operate upon limited data and are bound by statutory thresholds.

Attention has also been drawn to the defendant’s community engagement prior to detection, including unpaid volunteering at the Hillview Foodbank and participation in a local environmental clean-up group. Whilst such contributions ought not be discounted entirely, the court is obliged to weigh these acts of civic virtue against the gravity and potential impact of the offending.

It is necessary to take a brief digest of the procedural chronology at this point. After the defendant’s initial not guilty plea at the arraignment hearing on 20 March 2025, substantial disclosure was served in July, including volumes of encrypted and forensic material. The plea and trial preparation hearing on 15 July 2025 did not produce a change in plea. Only at the sentencing hearing on 26 August did Mr H enter a guilty plea to the charges. As this court has observed in prior cases, notably R v. Fernandez [2024] EWCA Crim 1985, delay in pleading runs counter to the underlying rationale of credit for plea, which is to encourage early acceptance of responsibility and to spare the court and victims the rigors of trial.

Considerable attention must be accorded to the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in R v. Ingram [2025] EWCA Crim 1274, where the appellate court underscored that tardy guilty pleas—even when entered before trial commences—are to be treated with circumspection in respect of sentence mitigation. The ruling was emphatic that the benefit to administration of justice diminishes appreciably once the prosecution’s case has crystallised. The defendant’s late pleas in the present proceedings fall squarely within the principles explicated in Ingram and, accordingly, merit only modest credit.

In assessing culpability, one must also have regard to historical case law elucidating the scope and application of the relevant statutory provisions. The provisions of section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 have been considered comprehensively in R v. Siddiqui [2017] EWCA Crim 2471, where the court explored the threshold for conduct preparatory to terrorism, emphasising the need for tangible steps beyond mere ideological expression. Similarly, R v. Baig [2020] EWCA Crim 345 examined the evidential basis required to establish the mens rea component, especially in the context of online communications.

The present case involved complex digital evidence including encrypted messaging, purported secure virtual environments, and use of proxy servers registered offshore. This court has been privileged to consider the lucid expert testimony of Dr Helena Brooks, a digital forensic specialist whose report was both thorough and erudite. Her evidence was instrumental in demonstrating the defendant’s active role in sourcing extremism manuals and weapons schematics via darknet marketplaces—conduct inconsistent with innocent exploration.

The defendant’s possession of a restricted encrypted USB flash drive labelled “project plans,” which contained schematics for improvised explosive devices, underscores the deliberate nature of the preparation. The prosecutorial evidence further delineates encrypted chat logs where Mr H exchanged detailed instructions about the assembly of triggering mechanisms.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

It is acknowledged by the court that the defendant has no previous convictions or cautions recorded against him, a factor which must, in principle, constitute a mitigating element, albeit a limited one given the seriousness of the present offences. The probation service’s pre-sentence report—detailed and professionally composed by Ms Claire Beaumont—provides a balanced view of Mr H’s background, including his early educational attainment and subsequent occupational instability. The probation officer observed a tendency towards social withdrawal and rigid ideological positions.

In conjunction with that report, the court has received the psychiatric assessment conducted by Dr Harold Iqbal, consultant forensic psychiatrist attached to St. Brendan’s Secure Hospital. He diagnosed the defendant with a personality disorder marked by obsessive-compulsive traits and rigidity but expressly found no psychosis or other recognised severe mental illness which would diminish culpability.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Consideration has also been given to the submissions made on behalf of the defendant concerning the purported impact of social media echo chambers and online radicalisation algorithms. While the court recognises the growing scholarship on the influence of digital platforms in entrenching extremist worldview, it respectfully notes that the existence of such channels does not effectively excuse or excuse the deliberate decisions to acquire terrorist manuals and weapon components.

Several letters were produced from local community groups and faith organisations, speaking of the defendant’s occasional attendance at interfaith forums and his willingness to participate in dialogue sessions aimed at cohesion. These submissions reflect the enduring tension between rehabilitation prospects and the severity of ideological adherence displayed.

It is however necessary to record, with regret, that resources available to probation and community-based deradicalisation programmes remain stretched and far from ideal. The national capacity, despite government commitments, has been constrained by recruitment shortfalls and funding instabilities, as the Magistrates Association reports in its 2024 Annual Briefing. This lacuna imperils the ability to adequately manage risks posed by persons convicted of terrorism-related offences in the community.

Similarly, the court met with representatives from the Bristol Resettlement Pathway under the aegis of MAPPA Category 3 arrangements. Their submission, concise but earnest, acknowledges the complexities posed by Mr H’s ideological profile and the need for tightly coordinated supervision, including electronic monitoring and restricted social media access. The involvement of the South West Prevent Coordination Unit has been ongoing, with attempts to engage the defendant in disengagement schemes, though engagement remains limited and tentative.

It merits mention that during the remand period, no indicators of significant misconduct have arisen, and prison reports describe Mr H as “quiet, cooperative but distant,” an observation that, while neutral, must be interpreted in context.

The court is aware, through case precedent such as R v. Knowles [2018] EWCA Crim 2919, of the necessity to calibrate custodial sentences with an eye to both deterrence and prospects for rehabilitation. Knowles emphasised that while punishment is paramount, a rigidly punitive approach neglects the potential reintegration benefits afforded by structured interventions.

The court is cognizant too of the societal concerns highlighted in recent parliamentary debates regarding the prolonging of sentences without sufficient evidence of efficacy. However, public safety remains the overarching, non-negotiable consideration.

The financial dimensions of Mr H’s activities were explored in detail by forensic accountants from CTPSW, who uncovered multiple cryptocurrency transactions totalling approximately £5,200 over a twelve-month period, linked to digital wallets associated with overseas entities noted for arms trading. While such transactions are not crimes per se, in this context they assume heavy significance as enablers of support for planned violence.

It is observed that the defendant maintained a discrete pattern of cash withdrawals and transfers, consistent with attempts to obfuscate the monetary trail—a factor which aggravates culpability and evidences a degree of sophistication and planning.

Anecdotally, the court notes the growing debate in academic circles concerning the pros and cons of cryptocurrency regulation. Proponents argue that decentralised finance brings financial inclusion and resilience; critics warn it provides criminal elements with an untraceable conduit for illicit funding. This court does not seek to resolve those contentions but remains alert to the operational realities and their impact on security.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Turning now to the personal background of Mr H. He is a 31-year-old male, of mixed heritage, educated through state-funded schools and subsequently completing a degree in computer science at a regional university. His employment history is uneven, with periods of contract work interspersed with intervals of unemployment. Character references from a former employer and community youth worker indicate a man capable of socially constructive participation when not under ideological influence.

The defence has tendered several letters from friends and family, including one from his cousin, Ms Farah Khan, who describes the defendant’s pre-arrest demeanor as “quiet but caring.” They acknowledge a downward trajectory beginning in late 2022 when his political and religious views became increasingly rigid.

The court is appreciative of these efforts and notes encouragement from supportive relationships as a potential foundation for positive change. Yet, as emphasised in R v. Ashraf [2023] EWCA Crim 1299, personal connections, whilst valuable, do not offset the threat posed by sustained preparatory conduct towards mass harm.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

The psychiatric report concludes that Mr H presents a high risk of serious harm if untreated and unmonitored, especially given his adherence to extremist ideology and his apparent proficiency in digital communications and engineering principles. Although he does not meet the criteria for a mental disorder warranting diminished responsibility, his marked cognitive rigidity and moral absolutism represent significant obstacles to disengagement.

In mitigation, the court registers that the defendant demonstrated some cooperation with authorities after arrest and has expressed, albeit belatedly, a willingness to consider structured support aimed at ideological disengagement. However, the court notes with caution the limited evidence of genuine contrition and the guarded nature of his engagement.

This case epitomises the profound challenges inherent in addressing terrorism offences where the defendant combines technical skill, ideological commitment, and operational planning. The danger posed is not hypothetical but substantive, warranting a custodial response commensurate with the risk to the public.

In concluding, the court orders the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The probation service is directed to consider the applicability of an Extended Determinate Sentence under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, focusing on risk management post-custody through tools such as GPS monitoring, exclusion zones, mandatory polygraph testing, and high-intensity cognitive behavioural work targeting extremist beliefs.

The report should canvass the availability of specialist accommodation within approved premises equipped for managing terrorism-related risks, and input from psychologists skilled in Structured Professional Judgement (SPJ-10) frameworks. The court expresses no provisional view as to the length of sentence but emphasizes that public protection and deterrence are paramount.

These sentencing remarks are pronounced this day, 26 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been conducted openly and fully comply with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules concerning the preparation and retention of a formal record. All parties have been accorded full opportunity to make submissions.

I must take this occasion to acknowledge, with gratitude, the diligence of the court staff and ushers in the Bristol Crown Court, whose recently refurbished accommodation has materially improved the environment for all participants. Also, recognition is owed to officers from CTPSW who, despite rising demands and constrained budgets, have executed complex operations with commendable professionalism.

I remind the defendant of his statutory right to appeal the sentence within 28 days following its imposition pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

These are the orders of the court.
