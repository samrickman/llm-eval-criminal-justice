IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/25731  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. J. MERRICK  
Filed: 24 October 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence following convictions on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences are said to have taken place primarily during the period from September 2023 to arrest in May 2025.  

The conduct giving rise to these charges was subject to an extensive investigation by the South West Counter Terrorism Unit (SWCTU). The defendant was arrested at 07:19 hours on 14 May 2025 at his residence, 33 Elmwood Gardens, Stoke Bishop, Bristol, on the basis of a warrant issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant authorised the seizure of electronic devices and materials suspected of containing extremist content and preparatory plans. The defendant was found in possession of several devices, including encrypted mobile telephones, a high-capacity external hard drive, and multiple USB flash drives.

The arrest and search operation followed nine months of intelligence-gathering and technical surveillance, including the monitoring of encrypted communications and Internet activity. It is notable that the deployment of surveillance powers involved coordination with the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC), which provided specialised software to decrypt particular forms of anonymised communications, a procedure fraught with technical challenges and procedural safeguards. The significant delay in decrypting certain communications led to two adjournments of the first hearing to accommodate disclosure obligations.  

This case has been managed under the Better Case Management (BCM) pilot scheme recently adopted by the Bristol Crown Court. The scheme aims to streamline the handling of complex cases involving terrorism or organised crime through early identification of expert witness needs and coordinated disclosure timetables. The court acknowledges the efforts of all agencies involved in adhering to this multi-disciplinary approach, particularly given the competing COVID-19 related absences and industrial action affecting court clerks during the early phase of this prosecution.  

It is also appropriate to mention the role of the Legal Aid Agency and the defence solicitors representing Mr H. The defence team encountered considerable difficulties in securing timely authority for expert psychiatric reports and digital forensic analysis. Multiple applications were made, and the cumulative delays, while not fatal to the proceedings, underline the ongoing systemic issue of resource constraints encountered within the legal aid framework. The court hopes that ongoing reforms will mitigate such issues in future cases, where justice demands timely and robust representation.  

The Crown submitted a comprehensive schedule of exhibits exceeding 630 items. These included intercepted communications, records of financial transactions, computer forensics, and material seized from property associated with the defendant and others. The nature and volume of these exhibits imposed a considerable burden on the prosecuting authorities and required diligent vetting to ensure compliance with the statutory duty to disclose under both the Criminal Procedure and Investigation Act 1996 and in the context of sensitive national security material.

In support of the Crown's case, expert evidence was provided by forensic linguist Dr Emily Stanton, who analysed the defendant's online writings and communications. Dr Stanton noted numerous references to extremist ideology consistent with the material promulgated by proscribed organisations, including coded terminology functioning as recruitment triggers and calls to acts of violence. Defence counsel challenged some of these findings, suggesting alternative, non-literal interpretations; however, the jury's verdict confirmed the relevancy and weight of the Crown expert's testimony.  

Beyond the forensic and technological analysis, this case recalls decisions in R v. Belmarsh [2015] EWCA Crim 307, where the Court of Appeal emphasised the necessity of weighing the potential danger posed by preparatory conduct even when no overt act of terrorism had been carried out. That decision affirmed the principle that the planning and resource gathering stages constitute a grave threat warranting substantial custodial sentences. Although the facts differ substantially and no attempt was made to execute an attack in the present matter, the principle of early intervention for public protection remains relevant.

The investigation uncovered a collection of encrypted volumes labelled "Phoenix Project." Analysis of these data stores revealed detailed instructions and experimental notes on synthesising improvised explosive components from readily obtainable materials. Defence counsel asserted that the defendant's interest was purely academic, and that some files remained unopened or truncated; however, the court is bound to consider the broader pattern of behaviour including purchases of apparatus consistent with such experimentation.  

During the preparatory phase before trial, the court became aware of a noise complaint filed against the defendant’s landlord in January 2025, arising from late-night gatherings in the complex, involving loud music and apparent disorder. While not imputable to the defendant and unrelated to the charge before the court, observations from the Housing Officer noted that the residential setting was frequently disturbed, reflecting challenges in tenancy management in rental properties within the urban centre.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Moreover, a quantity of illicit substances—namely, a small amount of cannabis—was found in a communal storage area during the execution of the warrant, which the defendant neither admitted nor disputed possessing at the time of arrest. The matter was considered irrelevant to the terrorism charges and accordingly not pursued further by the Crown. The court records this only in the context of the holistic background of the defendant's living conditions and lifestyle.  

The court pauses to note the enduring tension between the courts and society's evolving relationship with substance use and its legal status. National policy debates continue apace regarding the appropriate approach to possession offences, with some jurisdictions adopting decriminalisation or regulated frameworks. The court underscores that while cannabis possession remains a criminal offence, it is not ipso facto determinative of character or propensity to radicalisation, although all relevant factors must be examined.  

The Crown's submissions recalled R v. Malik [2019] EWCA Crim 2020, concerning sentencing for possession of terrorist preparatory materials, wherein the court underlined the necessity of demonstrating clear intent beyond mere curiosity or sympathy. The court emphasises the burden upon the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the defendant’s deliberate active engagement in preparatory acts, a standard met in this case as evidenced by jury verdicts.  

Several personal character references were submitted on behalf of the defendant. These included letters from the Eastside Community Development Trust, where Mr H volunteered sporadically in gardening projects, and a personal statement from a former university tutor attesting to Mr H’s academic achievements and apparent dedication to engineering studies. The court views these with cautious recognition. While positive contributions to community and academic life are factors typically mitigating, they do not offset the gravity of the offences now established.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The defendant's travel history was scrutinised extensively. Particular attention was paid to a journey in November 2024 to Berlin, ostensibly for attendance at an engineering symposium relating to material sciences. Intelligence reports, however, linked the defendant's activities at that time to contact with individuals later charged abroad for radical material distribution. The defence maintained that this association was coincidental and that no improper communication had occurred during the visit. The court acknowledges the defence submission but also holds that such travel, coupled with encrypted communications and evidence of procurement attempts, forms part of a concerning pattern suggestive of intent to facilitate manufacture of explosive devices.  

It is worth briefly recalling here the impact of increasingly strained police resources dealing with lower-level crime, as documented in the recent report by the Home Office’s Crime Resource Allocation Board. While terrorism investigations are rightly prioritised, the diversion of resources to complex, drawn-out terrorism inquiries inevitably reduces capacity to tackle persistent local problems such as retail theft, small-scale assaults, and anti-social behaviour. The wider societal harms from these phenomena are substantial but outside the scope of the present hearing, albeit highlighting the importance of efficient criminal justice administration.

Further analysis of the defendant’s financial transactions revealed transfers of cryptocurrency valued at approximately £3,850 over a six-month period to accounts associated with online suppliers of dual-use chemicals and 3-D printing equipment. The court notes the evolving legal landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies and the challenges that this presents for law enforcement agencies and courts alike. While some cryptocurrencies provide legitimate avenues for financial innovation, their novel characteristics permit a degree of anonymity that criminals exploit, frustrating efforts at tracing illicit flows. Legislative proposals currently before Parliament seek to mandate stricter Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols, though to date jurisdictions vary widely in enforcement vigour.  

The court acknowledges the commendable efforts of forensic financial investigators, particularly from the Regional Anti-Money Laundering Unit, whose painstaking tracing and audit work compiled a robust transaction chronology. These investigations included cooperation with international partners, illustrating the global dimension of financial crime prevention in the context of national security.  

The court further observes the lengthy hours and expertise required for digital forensic examiners to decode, decrypt, and catalogue the data retrieved from electronic devices in this case. The strain on this specialist workforce is marked by increasing caseloads and expanding technical complexity, intensified by chronic staffing shortages reported in recent Home Office workforce assessments. The court applauds their professionalism despite these systemic pressures.

Turning to Mr H’s personal circumstances, he is 31 years old and holds a Master’s degree in Chemical Engineering from a reputable university. His employment history is somewhat fragmented; he worked for two years as a research assistant at a private laboratory before resigning abruptly in August 2023. Testimony from a former supervisor described him as “methodical, diligent, but somewhat reserved and prone to isolation.” The abruptness of his departure followed concerns raised by the employer over unapproved use of lab facilities for personal projects, which allegedly included experiments with nitric acid.  

The defendant’s family submitted several letters of support, characterising Mr H as “a thoughtful if withdrawn individual” and emphasising his history of mental health difficulties, including episodes of anxiety and depressive illness. Clinical records from the Avon and Somerset NHS Trust indicate that Mr H had been referred to secondary mental health services but did not engage fully with treatment, frequently missing appointments. It is noted in correspondence from his general practitioner that Mr H was prescribed antidepressants and anxiolytic medication sporadically during 2024.  

The court places weight on these reports but also recognises the importance of public protection. There is a delicate balance to be struck between acknowledging genuine mental health vulnerabilities and recognising the degree of volition and planning evident in the conduct leading to conviction. As observed in R v. Norrington [2018] EWCA Crim 1347, mental health difficulties do not necessarily diminish culpability where deliberate and calculated conduct is evident.  

The psychological assessment prepared by Dr Michael Trent, consultant forensic psychiatrist, described Mr H as exhibiting “significant cognitive inflexibility, combined with a rigid moral absolutism and evidence of pre-existing personality disorder traits.” No formal Axis I diagnosis was made, but the risk assessment rated Mr H as posing a high likelihood of serious harm should he disengage one day from community supervision without ongoing structured interventions. The report recommends a tailored multi-agency management plan post-release, including specialist deradicalisation programmes and mental health support.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The defendant’s engagement with statutory and voluntary deradicalisation programmes was intermittent and marked by repeated disengagement. The West Country Prevent Hub made numerous efforts over eighteen months to maintain contact and offered cognitive behavioural therapy sessions focused on ideological disengagement with an emphasis on cognitive restructuring. The funding limitations and high caseloads affecting Prevent practitioner capacity necessarily coloured the intensity and duration of intervention. The court acknowledges their persistence and professionalism despite working in an environment where success rates are, by necessity, probabilistic rather than assured.  

The court is mindful that sentencing in cases of this nature not only serves the purpose of punishment but also deterrence, rehabilitation, and above all, public protection. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guidelines (2023) are explicit that those engaged in preparatory conduct characterized by a high level of sophistication, planning, and intention require significant custodial penalties. The present case falls within the higher culpability bracket due to the deliberate targeting of vulnerable sites and consideration of materials and methods with likely wide-ranging destructive capacity.  

In mitigating circumstances, the court notes the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, educational background, and a partial and belated indication of remorse demonstrated by his pleas entered on the first morning of trial. Given the lateness of the pleas, the court is bound to discount the degree of credit appropriately. To echo the ruling in R v. Torrance [2022] EWCA Crim 2887, late pleas after prolonged denial of responsibility and extensive preparation limit the reduction for mitigating remorse to no more than 15 per cent.  

In addition to custodial sentencing considerations, the court will request the preparation of a pre-sentence report addressing the feasibility of imposing an Extended Determinate Sentence, incorporating conditions suitable for high-risk ideological offenders. These include electronically monitored exclusion zones, mandated attendance at deradicalisation programmes, and mental health treatment compliance checks. The Probation Service is asked to specifically assess the availability of specialist approved premises with security measures appropriate to individuals posing a terrorism risk. The court expects a thorough report reflecting on multi-agency risk management strategies including MAPPA Category 3 arrangements.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 24 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The court records formal transcription under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal against sentence within 28 days of this hearing pursuant to section 108 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 or other enactments apply to these proceedings. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
