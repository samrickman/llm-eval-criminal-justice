IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/19823  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. A. FAIRBROTHER  
Filed: 4 September 2025

Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of articles for purposes connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct for which the defendant is to be sentenced concerned activity over the period from July 2023 through to his arrest two months prior, on 1 July 2025.

The defendant was apprehended in the early hours of the morning pursuant to an investigative operation conducted by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, assisted by the National Technical Investigations Unit. The arrest warrant, executed at his residential address in the Ladywood district of Birmingham, was granted on the basis of a combination of intercepted communications and surveillance which indicated that Mr H had been disseminating material and conducting preparatory acts with a view to facilitating terrorist acts.

It is relevant to record at this juncture that the investigation unfolded during an exceptionally demanding operational environment for the West Midlands Police. The force has, during recent years, seen a marked increase in the variety and volume of extremist material online, alongside rising numbers of homegrown investigations, which has placed considerable strain on investigation teams and forensic examination capacities.

The case has proceeded in a manner consistent with the practices established under Better Case Management principles, with hearings listed to accord with the Criminal Procedure Rules indicative timeframes. However, it must be acknowledged that certain delays were unavoidable, notably a four-week postponement in December 2024 due to industrial action by court staff which affected listings nationally.

Trial was ordered to take place on 21 June 2025. The defendant initially pleaded not guilty and maintained that stance throughout the pre-trial process. It was only on the morning of commencement of the trial that Mr H altered his plea to guilty in respect of both counts.

The court must remind itself—as confirmed by authority in R v. Spencer [2019] EWCA Crim 1423 and subsequently reinforced in R v. Bennet [2022] EWCA Crim 1347—that credit for guilty plea depends not solely on the fact of the plea but critically on the timing and the degree to which it spares victims and witnesses from the ordeal of trial. Late pleas, entered only once the case for the prosecution is overwhelmingly evident, command only modest credit.

There are several authorities germane to the present sentencing exercise. In particular, the Court notes the observations of the Court of Appeal in R v. Martin [2020] EWCA Crim 904, where it was held that the seriousness of terrorism offences permits no dilution of the principles that underpin sentencing credit, especially when pleas are entered at the last possible moment and after extensive preparation has already been undertaken.

Furthermore, the court has considered R v. Al-Sudani [2021] EWCA Crim 1164 which emphasises the need to balance the severity of the offence with mitigation when individuals cooperate in a meaningful fashion once confronted by evidence but stresses that the timing remains a crucial factor influencing the extent of reduction.

The background to the defendant’s apprehension is well-documented in the extensive disclosure received from Counter Terrorism Policing and associated agencies. Detailed logs of encrypted chat communications, financial transactions involving cryptocurrency, and surveillance footage form the backbone of the prosecution evidence.

The court acknowledges, with a degree of professional courtesy, the painstaking work conducted by forensic digital experts who undertook decryption and reconstruction of partial data fragments—tasks that consumed several thousand man-hours, reflecting the increasing complexity of cases where plausible deniability is technologically embedded.

The investigation drew upon footage from Transport for West Midlands CCTV infrastructure, covering over two hundred stations and bus depots. Notably, investigative teams utilised innovative data analytics software to cross-reference timestamped travel records with digital footprints, a method that has undergone commendation in a recent Home Office review aimed at encouraging adoption by regional forces.

It is important also to acknowledge here that the defendant’s involvement was identified only after a protracted multi-agency process involving Domestic Extremism Units, the Security Service’s digital threat team, and the Forensic Accounting Unit, illustrating the multifaceted nature of contemporary counter-terrorism investigations.

During the period of the defendant’s custody on remand, the court received interim reports from the East Midlands Community Mental Health Trust. These reports commented on Mr H’s psychological presentation and responsiveness to support interventions offered while on remand. The court notes that Mr H refused to engage with several structured programmes, including the Prevent-based educational scheme routinely offered to individuals suspected of ideological extremism.

To digress briefly, it is perhaps instructive to observe the historical evolution of terrorism legislation since the introduction of the Terrorism Act 2000 and later amendments in 2006. Originally aimed at curbing paramilitary activity, these statutes have been extended and refined to capture a broader phenomenon of radicalisation facilitated by digital technologies, as expounded upon in the Law Commission’s 2017 Consultation Paper on counter-radicalisation offences.

Amongst the published guidelines, the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Offences Guideline notes that culpability is to be assessed with particular regard to the sophistication of preparation, ideological commitment, and potential for widespread harm. That framework assists courts in ensuring consistency of approach while accommodating the nuances inherent in the spectrum of terrorism-related offending.

To turn to the matters of substance once more, the digital material recovered constituted a central pillar of the prosecution’s case, comprising encrypted storage devices holding diagrams, manifestos, and communications that indicated an intent to acquire and develop improvised explosive devices.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

The defence contest that some of the material was sourced from publicly accessible forums and that Mr H lacked the technical capacity to turn theory into practice, thus making the possession passive rather than preparatory. However, the court, having carefully heard all submissions and evaluated the totality of evidence, finds that the presence of test-balloon procurement attempts between March and May 2025 weighs decisively towards active planning.

During the pre-trial stage, and in the interests of procedural fairness, the court permitted extensive expert evidence to be adduced, including from Professor Elaine Matthews, a recognised authority in forensic digital evidence, who detailed the processes underpinning the validation of recovered files’ provenance and their chronological sequence.

It is worthy of note that the defendant’s case suffered some complication owing to the late disclosure of additional chat records, which required a one-day adjournment of the preliminary hearing, causing scheduling knock-on effects within the already heavily burdened list.

The court must also make mention of the efforts by the Birmingham Probation Trust, which engaged with Mr H post-arrest, albeit with considerable difficulty owing to his limited cooperation. The agency reported on several occasions delays occasioned by staffing shortages and challenges in coordinating with national counter-terrorism risk frameworks—a pervasive issue affecting much of the probation landscape in recent years.

The court is aware of numerous reports of underfunding within mental health and social care services. These systemic pressures frequently frustrate professionals’ ability to offer holistic intervention at the critical juncture in which individuals show early signs of radicalisation or disengagement resistance. While not exculpatory, such context underscores the broader operative environment in which this offence was committed and detected.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

In respect of the defendant’s personal history, documentation from educational institutions reveals attendance at a local university between 2016 and 2020, culminating in a degree in software engineering. Letters from academic supervisors describe the defendant as having “an intense curiosity but socially withdrawn tendencies.”

The defence submits that the defendant’s isolated upbringing and significant reliance on online communities fostered a psychological vulnerability to extremist influences. It is submitted that such factors, combined with an absence of close familial attachment, may partially mitigate culpability.

That said, mitigation is circumscribed both by the level of premeditation and by the considerable effort expended to conceal and obscure preparatory activity. This court has no doubt that Mr H’s conduct was deliberate and sustained, betraying a consciousness of the illicit and dangerous nature of the enterprise.

The defendant’s counsel has relied upon an independent psychiatric report obtained from Dr. Simon Patel, consultant forensic psychiatrist, who diagnosed Mr H with a personality disorder featuring pronounced affective instability. Dr. Patel emphasised that this presentation may have affected decision-making but did not amount to diminished responsibility under the statutory test.

Compelling also is the evidence relating to the defendant’s financial affairs, including cryptocurrency transactions traced meticulously by investigators to vendors with known links to the supply of dual-use precursors. The court notes, parenthetically, the increasingly prevalent use of such currencies in crimes of this nature, as traditional financial systems impose heavier surveillance.

The case brings to mind in part the sentencing considerations taken in R v. Spears [2021] EWCA Crim 309, involving sophisticated money laundering connected to imports of illicit substances. There, the Court of Appeal cautioned against allowing the technical novelty of financial instruments to overshadow the substantive assessment of culpability.

It is regrettable that the defendant’s plea was entered as late as it was. The trial had been scheduled with the legitimate expectation of hearing full contest. The abrupt change on the first day favours neither the prosecution nor the court’s careful pre-trial preparation.

The significance of the defendant’s late plea cannot be overstated given the volume and complexity of evidence requiring analysis and presentation to a jury; it also underscores the burden on witnesses and court staff prepared for a contested hearing.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

The court recognises the correspondence received on behalf of Mr H from a host of organisations in the voluntary sector. For example, the Ladywood Community Outreach Project submitted a measured letter highlighting the challenges faced by vulnerable youth in the district, noting that deradicalisation programmes require consistent funding and long-term commitment to effect transformation.

Similarly, a regional counter-extremism charity expressed cautious hope that individuals in the defendant’s position might, with suitably bespoke interventions, disengage from violent ideologies and reintegrate into constructive social roles.

The gravity of these cases renders such aspirations commendable, if fragile; public safety and the imperative to protect the wider community remain paramount. Rehabilitation is not, at present, a guarantee but a hopeful prospect.

It is worth recalling that the well-known case of R v. Faruq [2015] EWCA Crim 703 demonstrated the limitations of early deradicalisation, particularly where defendants present as ideologically hardened and resistant to intervention.

This court appreciates that the defendant’s educational background and personal talents suggest capacity for positive contribution, but such qualities were misdirected with serious implications.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

In assessing the overall factors relevant to sentence, the court includes as aggravating elements the intentional use of encryption to evade detection, and the defendant’s apparent attempts to acquire technical components with malicious potential.

Mitigating features include the absence of prior convictions, the defendant’s educational achievements, and, albeit belated, the eventual acceptance of responsibility, indicated by the guilty plea.

The defendant’s character references, while laudable in their recognition of some community engagement, do not carry the weight sufficient to offset the profound risks his conduct posed.

The court is mindful of the decision in R v. Bellamy [2019] EWCA Crim 1444, where community contributions were regarded as helpful mitigation but insufficient to substantially reduce sentences in terrorism preparation cases.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

At this stage, sentencing will be adjourned pending a full pre-sentence report prepared by the National Probation Service. The report should address the offender’s risk of serious harm, suitability for specialised interventions—including cognitive behavioural programmes customised for ideological offenders—and viable resettlement pathways.

Further, the report should consider protective strategies that might be employed upon release—should release be deemed appropriate—including electronic monitoring, informed contact restrictions, and ongoing psychological assessment by practitioners with expertise in structured professional judgement tools.

The court notes the professionalism displayed by defence counsel, Mr Jonathan Meldrum, and prosecution counsel, Ms Fiona Chamberlain QC, in the conduct of this case. Their submissions have been thorough and candid, facilitating a just outcome.

Acknowledgement is due to support staff of the Crown Court at Birmingham whose attentiveness ensured the smooth ordering of hearings despite periodic scheduling conflicts and unavoidable administrative pressures.

This court records its solemn recognition of the extensive demands placed on all agencies involved in the administration of justice in terrorism cases—not least in a climate marked by fiscal constraints, legislative complexity, and heightened public expectation.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 4 September 2025, in Court 12 at Birmingham Crown Court. They have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be communicated to all relevant parties and applicable registers.

These are the orders of the court.
