IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29844  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge E. J. WHITCOMBE  
Filed: 11 September 2025

Mr H attends this court today for sentence upon convictions of offences contrary to the Terrorism Act 2006, specifically engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism pursuant to section 5(1)(a), and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism under section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct in question ranges from May 2023 through to the defendant's arrest in January 2025.

The defendant was initially detained on the morning of 14 January 2025 following coordinated actions by Counter Terrorism Policing South West and the Special Branch of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary. The arrest took place at an address in Eastville, Bristol, pursuant to warrants executed under the authority of section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, supported by intelligence from the Secret Intelligence Service relating to encrypted communications and suspicious online activity. The seizure of devices at the property included multiple digital media, a high-end laptop, and a set of components consistent with amateur electronics work.

This arrest closed an investigation codenamed Operation GREYLOCK, lasting over 18 months and involving domestic and international liaison with agencies including the National Crime Agency and Europol. The investigative methodology blended traditional surveillance techniques such as human assets, electronic intercepts, and covert premises observation, alongside cutting-edge digital forensic analysis. The prosecution respectfully commends, and this court acknowledges, the painstaking efforts by the specialist teams involved—often operating under significant operational pressures and shifting political priorities.

It is germane to note that the ongoing strain on the National Digital Exploitation Service (NDES), tasked with reviewing a backlog that recently eclipsed 20,000 devices, impacted the expeditious review of the material seized. Such backlogs stand in stark contrast to the prevailing political rhetoric promising swift justice, underscoring the disconnect between policy and practical resourcing.

Ms Sarah Edmonds, senior Crown Prosecutor, has prepared a carefully considered skeleton argument that outlines the evidentiary foundation of the Crown’s case, particularly focussing on the forensic linkage between digital artefacts recovered and external communications with known proscribed entities. Miss Edmonds has exhibited commendable professionalism, especially in navigating the complexities arising from the interaction between open court principles and national security considerations.

The court, however, is unable to ignore the ongoing frustrations expressed by the defence regarding delays in securing legal aid funding, which notably postponed preliminary hearings by a cumulative period approaching two months. Such delays, while often unavoidable given the constrained budgetary environment in which the Legal Aid Agency operates, nonetheless produce real and palpable effects on the timely administration of justice.

Relevant case law is instructive regarding the assessment of culpability and appropriate sentencing in cases of this nature. In R v. Baksh [2018] EWCA Crim 433, the Court emphasised that preparatory terrorism offences require robust custodial sentences commensurate with the broader aims of deterrence and protection of the public. Similarly, the judgments in R v. Saeed [2020] EWCA Crim 1212 and R v. Al-Khater [2019] EWCA Crim 776 reiterate that even early-stage plots warrant serious punishment where the defendant exhibits determination and sophistication in the conduct.

It bears mentioning that the defendant’s online activity reflected a trajectory of escalating radicalisation, observable in the gradual shift from general political dissent to open embrace of violent extremism, as documented in the expert psycho-linguistic analysis submitted by the Crown. Of particular note is the defendant’s active participation in encrypted chat groups spreading incendiary materials and tactical advice, some hosted on overseas servers subject to longstanding surveillance.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

Despite submissions from defence counsel asserting the defendant possessed a genuine academic interest in explosives chemistry and sought primarily to engage in non-violent protest, the court is unpersuaded by this characterisation. The evidence clearly reveals an intent to prepare, and potentially execute, violent terrorist acts. Claims of benign motivation are further undermined by the defendant's use of encrypted communications and efforts to avoid detection.

An interesting but collateral observation relates to a related prosecution in the West Midlands where a co-defendant, Mr J, pleaded guilty to charges involving aggravated burglary with a firearm—a matter entirely unrelated to Mr H's conduct. Similarly, in those proceedings, Mr J's culpability was assessed separately given his admission to inflicting grievous bodily harm during the incident. While these related matters have been referenced in materials, the court carefully distinguishes them from the present offences. 

Further procedural aspects of this case are noteworthy. During the preliminary hearings, the court experienced intermittent delays due to pressures on court listing availability, including a Missed Listing on 15 April 2025 arising from court staff shortages following strike action. These developments, while regrettable, fall outside the parties’ control and the court must manage judicial resources within practical constraints.

Attention is drawn to a small quantity of cannabis found in the defendant’s residence at the time of the search. This possession has not resulted in a separate charge nor has it been considered aggravating in relation to the terrorism offences. Rather, its presence served implicitly to highlight the defendant's attempts to maintain a 'normal' façade, a pattern observed in prior terrorism cases where offenders seek to mask ideological extremism behind quotidian behaviours.

The defence has placed reliance upon character references from various civic groups, including Good Neighbours Bristol and the Avon Repair Café, where Mr H is noted to have volunteered intermittently repairing household electrical items and assisting with community workshops. While the court recognises commendable community involvement, it must emphasise that such activity, in isolation, has limited mitigation value when juxtaposed against the gravity of the offences before this court.

It also merits acknowledgment that Mr H's professional background includes employment as a junior electronic technician at a local factory. References from supervisors commend his diligence and precision, but note a recent decline in attendance and abrupt cessation of employment in the months preceding arrest.

The Crown emphasises the import of a trip taken by Mr H to Brussels in September 2024, ostensibly for tourism, but intelligence reports indicate he attended a rally featuring speakers now known to espouse extremist views. Surveillance footage from the Rue de la Loi captures him associating with individuals subsequently prosecuted elsewhere for firearm offences. Defence counsel offer the explanation of coincidence, a submission the court treats with the measured scepticism warranted on balance of probabilities.

Procedural fairness demands the court consider the defence’s submissions regarding the defendant’s mental health. Dr Fiona West, consultant forensic psychiatrist, prepared a detailed report commissioned by the defence. She diagnosed features consistent with an adjustment disorder compounded by chronic anxiety, but importantly no psychosis or recognised severe mental illness. The report cautions that while the defendant shows indications of cognitive rigidity and heightened sensitivity to perceived social rejection, his capacity for criminal responsibility remains intact.

The defendant has engaged at points with the Calderside Prevent Hub, a multi-disciplinary team operating under the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) framework. The Hub's submissions commended an improvement in compliance with appointments during late 2024 but acknowledged persistent partial disengagement, particularly in terms of ideology-flexing modules. The court recognises the Hub’s professionalism in balancing respect for civil liberties with the demands of public safety.

By way of contextualising pressures on investigative bodies, the court notes that the Avon and Somerset Police Counter Terrorism Unit, which managed Operation GREYLOCK, concurrently fielded an increase in local non-terrorism incidents, including a notable spike in arson attacks on commercial properties—a trend linked in press reports to a regional surge in gang-related violence. The diversion of resources, though unremarked on in formal reports, arguably impacts the prioritisation of preventive operations.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Turning now to sentencing principles: the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines of 2023 remain the principal framework, emphasising the triad of culpability, harm potential, and offender characteristics. Mr H's conduct places him at the higher egree of culpability due to the preparatory nature of his offences and the demonstrated intent to utilise dangerous materials.

Referral to the precedent in R v. Mirza [2023] EWCA Crim 311 is apposite here, where the Court of Appeal upheld lengthy custodial sentences for similar preparatory conduct, underlining the necessity of sending a deterrent message both to similarly motivated individuals and the broader community.

The court has also considered the expanding jurisprudence concerning cryptocurrency usage in terrorism financing. Here, one transaction tracing £3,200 in bitcoin from a wallet linked to the defendant to an online vendor specialising in chemicals for hobbyists was identified. This is consistent with trends noted in the Home Office’s annual report on serious organised crime, which highlights the increasing use of decentralised finance technologies by extremist groups.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

The court acknowledges the defendant’s academic qualifications, including a diploma in electrical engineering, and expresses appreciation for the contributions of Ms Helen Park, the probation officer assigned to prepare the pre-sentence report, who has worked diligently despite the chronic understaffing affecting probation services nationwide. The office has been struggling with caseloads nearly 40% above capacity, leading to delays in report preparation and follow-up in many jurisdictions.

The court also recognises the longstanding issues confronting the National Health Service's provision of mental health services, particularly secure forensic settings, where waiting lists frequently extend beyond six months, thereby complicating timely access to in-custody psychiatric care. This systemic shortfall inevitably impacts both risk assessment and post-custodial management.

This court is additionally mindful of the broader social challenges faced by urban communities, such as the creeping normalisation of antisocial behaviour, rising street homelessness, and a discernible erosion of informal social cohesion. While such factors do not excuse criminal conduct, they form part of an essential background matrix that informs our understanding of the challenges in both preventing and responding to extremist violence.

Finally, it is requisite to commend the steadfast work of the West Country Resettlement Network, whose engagement with offenders released from custody under stringent licence provisions involving terrorism-related conditions is both comprehensive and committed. Their work in facilitating reintegration, managing electronic monitoring, and coordinating multi-agency risk meetings is often performed under conditions of significant resource constraint and public scrutiny, attesting to their professional dedication.

The court will proceed to order a pre-sentence report of the defendant, requesting particular attention to risk assessment under current structured professional judgement frameworks, his prospects for engagement in desistance and disengagement programmes, and formulate recommendations for appropriate custodial or community determinations, mindful of public protection.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 11 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been duly transcribed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be electronically transmitted to the appropriate authorities for registration and enforcement.

These are the orders of the court.
