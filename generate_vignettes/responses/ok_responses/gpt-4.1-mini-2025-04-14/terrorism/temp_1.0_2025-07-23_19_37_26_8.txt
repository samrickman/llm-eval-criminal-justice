IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/25903  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge E. M. FIELDING  
Filed: 4 September 2025  

Mr H now appears before this court for sentence on charges including one count of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct specified in the indictment took place over a period commencing in September 2023 and concluding with his arrest on 17 April 2025.  

The defendant was arrested at 07:45 on 17 April 2025, following the execution of a search warrant at his residence in Avonmouth. The warrant had been issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 on the basis of intelligence gathered by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW) and supported by intercept material supplied by the Security Service. The interception revealed encrypted communications exchanged with a server known to be associated with extremist content, including manuals for improvised explosive devices. The defendant was found in possession of computer hardware comprising a desktop PC tower, three external hard drives, and various USB sticks, some of which were protected by multiple layers of encryption.

The investigation crystallized after approximately six months of covert inquiries involving pattern-of-life surveillance, cyber forensic analysis from the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU), and multi-agency liaison with the Home Office and the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command. The cross-jurisdictional dimension of the case required collaboration with Europol, particularly the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), to decrypt messaging apps linked to the defendant’s online persona, “DarkPulse”. This integrated approach reflects the increasing complexity of intelligence-led investigations in the counter-terrorism domain. It warrants acknowledgment that despite inter-agency resource pressures, there was effective sharing of intelligence and timely coordination between multiple investigative bodies.  

The defendant was initially remanded in custody pending trial. That remand period included two appearances before the magistrates’ court, which authorized further detention based on evidential grounds and risk assessment frameworks detailed in the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIMs). The procedural history was unremarkable save for an unavoidable adjournment caused by a delay in Legal Aid funding confirmation, which resulted in a postponement of the defence psychiatric assessment. This delay, while regrettable, did not prejudice the interests of justice and underscores the ongoing challenges faced by practitioners in securing timely and adequate representation for defendants in complex matters.  

It is important to observe that the defendant was referred to the local Prevent programme in early 2022 following concerns expressed by a university lecturer regarding his increasingly strident political views and the discovery of extremist literature in his possession. The Prevent case officer’s report, submitted to this court, indicates that the defendant engaged sporadically over a six-month period but ultimately declined further intervention. While not determinative, such engagement efforts are a relevant backdrop to understanding the trajectory of his conduct.  

On 25 July 2025, a plea and trial preparation hearing took place at Bristol Crown Court. Mr H initially pleaded not guilty to all counts but altered his plea to guilty on the morning of trial, 12 August 2025, immediately following legal argument on the admissibility of certain electronic communications. The timing of the plea limits the credit available. The Court is mindful of the well-established principle that while the law encourages early admissions of guilt which aid in conserving public resources and limit distress to victims and witnesses, late pleas entered merely as a tactical step benefit from reduced recognition.  

This principle has been reiterated in a line of authority including R v. Gregory [2023] EWCA Crim 1237 and R v. Neeson [2022] EWCA Crim 986, cases which examined the contours of sentence reduction for late guilty pleas in terrorism and related high-profile matters. These decisions underscore that in assessing the appropriate level of discount, it is imperative to distinguish between sincere expressions of remorse and the more strategic, opportunistic pleas which arise when the strength of evidence becomes overwhelming.  

The Court observes that Mr H’s defence, led by Mr James Farrow QC, ably instructed by solicitor Ms Anita Collins, has been robust throughout this protracted litigation. Notwithstanding delays attributed to disclosure complexity and the need to deploy new forensic techniques in relation to encrypted data, they have maintained a commendable commitment to procedural fairness. Regrettably, however, the defendant did not avail himself of opportunities to accept responsibility earlier, a fact which must inform sentencing.  

The Court’s experience with cases involving mental health and extremist ideology informs a cautious approach to sentencing. The report submitted on 28 August 2025 by Dr Louise McAllister, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Avon & Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust, provides valuable insight. Dr McAllister notes that while the defendant demonstrates “significant cognitive rigidity” and “a pronounced pattern of grievance-fuelled ideological fixation,” no formal diagnosis of psychosis or personality disorder is warranted. She cautions that the risk of continued extremist engagement remains elevated absent intensive, structured intervention.  

In approaching sentence, it is necessary to delineate the relevant legal framework. The sentence for offences under section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006 carries a maximum of life imprisonment, with the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Guidelines providing a structured framework to weigh culpability and harm potential. The court must assess factors such as level of planning sophistication, speculative vs. actual operational capability, and demonstrated intent to cause indiscriminate harm. Case law of relevance includes R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, which clarifies elements of “terrorist purpose,” and R v. Kadirov [2018] EWCA Crim 456, underscoring the gravity of preparatory conduct even absent execution.  

In considering the seriousness of the matter at hand, the court must also contextualize the cumulative impact of such offending on public safety resources and community cohesion.  

It is an unfortunate reality that, increasingly, police resources are taxed not only by serious and premeditated threats but also by a proliferation of hoax calls, minor offences misclassified due to heightened fears, and the rising tide of online material which, while sometimes rhetorical, may lay the groundwork for more concrete action. To this end, officers engaged in frontline counter-terrorism duties in the South West report enduring shortages in specialist task force personnel, impacting the timeliness of operational responses. This structural pressure does not excuse the defendant’s actions but is a relevant backdrop to understanding the broader systemic consequences of persistent extremist activity.  

The court is also aware that the Probation Service laboring under a recruitment and retention crisis—exacerbated post-pandemic—faces unprecedented caseloads. Cascading delays in preparation of pre-sentence reports have led to protracted custody durations before sentencing in other, less serious cases. The need to allocate scarce psychological resources to high-risk terrorism offenders has been prioritised, yet waiting times for approved premises suitable for such individuals remain long due to funding constraints.

The crown’s case centred, inter alia, on the publication, dissemination, and possession of extremist propaganda material via the defendant’s encrypted online channels. Linguistic experts employed by the Crown established that his communications consistently echoed language and motifs prevalent in proscribed groups’ manifestos and included exhortations to violence couched in coded speech. This court finds such communications, while not themselves criminal acts, highly probative of intent and ideological commitment when combined with the physical evidence.  

Following the seizure of the defendant’s electronic devices, forensic cryptographers at the NCCU encountered substantial technical difficulties in extracting data due to layered encryption protocols and complex steganographic concealment across storage media. The prolonged efforts—taking multiple months of continuous processing—highlight the evolving sophistication of digital concealment techniques in extremist milieus.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Despite strenuous defence efforts to portray some of the defendant’s digital activities as innocent scholarly pursuit—citing, for instance, publicly accessible flight path data and aerial photography common to hobbyists—the court finds the aggregate context persuasive that such information was acquired with operational intent. Notably, this includes reference to discrete communications with individuals linked to past foiled attacks on transport infrastructure.  

The trial also heard from guest expert Prof. Harriet Yuen, a specialist in terrorism and security studies from the University of Exeter, who provided an academic evaluation of the evolving nature of self-radicalized individuals operating online. Her evidence described the transition from passive consumption of extremist material to the stage of operational preparation as often marked by increased digital compartmentalization and use of anonymizing technologies. The court notes this evidence as illuminating, though the ultimate verdict must rest on the totality of factual findings.  

The Crown provided evidence of multiple encrypted PDFs recovered on Mr H’s devices. Some of these bore titles suggestive of explosive manufacture and tactical planning, including one document labelled “Fragmentation_dynamics_v5.” It was contested whether the entire content of these documents had been accessed or disseminated by the defendant, but the court finds sufficient circumstantial proof of engagement with this material to support the charges.  

In mitigation, the defence highlights Mr H’s lack of prior convictions and his expressed remorse following the plea. Letters of support from family members and community groups were tendered, including a detailed submission from the Avon Volunteer Food Bank, praising the defendant’s prior contributions in assisting with distribution logistics during periods of heightened local deprivation caused by supply chain disruptions in 2020 and 2021.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

During the preliminary hearings, defence counsel emphasised references to the defendant’s physical health challenges, including a history of asthma and a recent upper respiratory tract infection requiring hospitalization. While such factors invite consideration in custodial sentencing contexts, they do not diminish the gravity of the offence. They do, however, necessitate appropriate custodial healthcare provision.  

The defendant’s educational background is substantial. He holds a bachelor’s degree in computer science from the University of Bristol, awarded with second-class honours. His academic achievements have been detailed in character statements produced by former tutors who described him as “quiet but meticulous” and “engaged in community computing clubs.” Although such background arguably exposes him to countervailing influences, the court accepts that education alone provides no shield against ideological extremism.  

An inquiry into the defendant’s pre-arrest conduct revealed a brief period of employment in an IT support position with a regional telecommunications company. The employer noted his punctuality and diligence but also recorded concerns raised by management about the defendant’s frequent unexplained absences and curt communications with colleagues in early 2023, shortly before the onset of investigative interest.  

The defendant’s defence team provided submissions drawing upon the appellation of R v. Rahman [2021] EWCA Crim 1412, where the Court of Appeal emphasised the importance of proportionality in sentencing, particularly for first-time offenders without evidence of direct violence. The Court acknowledges this precedent but remains mindful that terrorism-related offending entails unique considerations of public protection.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Significantly, the court notes the interstate travel undertaken by Mr H during the relevant period, particularly a short trip to Manchester in October 2024. The visit, explained by the defendant as a leisure excursion, occurred contemporaneously with a major counter-terrorism operation targeting an unrelated group engaged in trafficking illicit arms. Although Mr H was not linked to these activities, the coincidence necessitated additional security camera analysis and resource diversion by investigating authorities.  

Stepping momentarily from the particulars of this case, it should be observed that similar investigations—such as the recently reported Operation RAVEN involving the dismantling of a drug smuggling network distributing high-grade heroin and crack cocaine—demand substantial allocation of challenge funds. The police response to such organised crime affects availability of detectives who might otherwise focus on counter-terrorism. While these matters do not pertain to Mr H’s conduct, they illustrate the competing operational demands on law enforcement.  

Letters received from Mr H’s estranged sibling, currently under investigation for allegations of benefit fraud, were disregarded by the court as irrelevant to sentencing. Such familial associations, though occasionally weighted in character assessments, here have no bearing on culpability.  

The defendant’s accommodation, a small tenancy in a mixed housing estate with local authority and private ownership, has been subject to routine landlord inspections and complaints related to noise nuisance, unconnected to the present charges. The court heard on the record that a noise abatement notice was served on the property’s owner during the defendant’s remand period, but this procedural fact is of no direct relevance.  

Furthermore, residential graffiti incidents reported on the estate, including recent vandalism to public transport infrastructure, have been part of heightened local policing in the area but not attributed to the defendant.  

The Crown has adduced correspondence exchanged between Mr H and a now-prospective co-defendant in a separate case concerning arms trafficking, though the contact was sporadic and limited to encrypted messaging. The co-defendant has failed to appear for trial and remains at large, which complicated considerations of joint enterprise. However, Mr H’s involvement in this broader context was not established beyond reasonable doubt, and convictions were based solely on his own conduct.  

The court is mindful that the Legal Aid Agency, at various points, declined early applications for funding for independent electronic forensic expertise, causing protracted debate and administrative bottlenecks. Such systemic issues impede robust defence preparation and are a disservice to the principles of open justice.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

One of the most troubling strands of evidence identified by the prosecution was a cryptocurrency transaction amounting to approximately £4,200, traced to an account linked to online darknet vendors of dual-use materials. While it is accepted that cryptocurrencies have legitimate applications, their misuse for criminal endeavour is well documented. The defendant’s transfer was routed through multiple tumblers intended to obfuscate origin and destination, marking an aggravating factor.  

The court has reviewed covert surveillance logs documenting Mr H’s presence at a riverside location late at night on 15 November 2024. These images were captured from multiple angles and required extensive analysis by CTPSW digital forensics teams to confirm the identity and correlate timing with activities suggestive of reconnaissance. Such efforts consumed significant investigative hours, underscoring the laborious nature of counter-terrorism intelligence work.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning now to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is 30 years of age and of no prior criminal conviction record. He has a somewhat distant relationship with family members and exhibited social withdrawal characteristics noted in psychiatric evaluations. Psychologist Dr Helen Clifford, engaged by the defence, identified “rigid interpretive frameworks and cognitive distortions related to identity and loyalty,” though without comorbid psychiatric disorder.  

Letters of support include those from the Avon Community Basketball League detailing Mr H’s volunteer contributions over a two-year period. While the Court appreciates such efforts, these infirmities of character must be weighed against the severity of his offending and public safety considerations.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Professor Damian Courtney, a leading forensic psychologist specialising in radicalisation, has assessed the defendant as presenting a significant ongoing risk of engaging in extremist behaviour post-release without intensive management and supervision. The evaluation emphasises the necessity for a multi-modal approach involving psychological interventions, curtailment of internet access, and potentially protracted licence conditions including polygraph testing.  

In conclusion, this case presents a challenging amalgam of ideological commitment, operational conduct, and technological sophistication. The aggravating features are many: deliberate procurement and use of extremist material, encrypted communications with known extremists, and the use of cryptocurrency to conceal financial transactions related to potential acts of terror. Mitigating factors are limited to the absence of prior convictions, educational background, and a guilty plea entered at a late stage. The plea credit is confined to a one-sixth reduction pursuant to established sentencing principles.  

The court will direct the preparation of a full pre-sentence report by the National Probation Service. This report should include consideration of the desirability and practicality of imposing an Extended Determinate Sentence pursuant to section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and address the feasibility of mandatory participation in high-intensity cognitive behavioural programmes, domiciliary restrictions, and protracted supervision post-release. The report should also evaluate approved premises suitability and possible referral to specialist deradicalisation units, mindful of resource constraints and programme completion rates.  

These sentencing remarks are hereby issued this 4th day of September 2025 in Court 9 at Bristol Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal judgment and sentence will be communicated to relevant authorities forthwith to facilitate registration and enforcement.  

These are the orders of the court.
