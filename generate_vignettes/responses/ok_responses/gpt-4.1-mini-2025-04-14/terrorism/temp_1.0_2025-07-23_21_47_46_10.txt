IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/26439  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. D. Farrington  
Filed: 15 August 2025  

Mr Mr H appears before this court for sentence following his conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of articles for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct charged principally concerns the period from October 2023 until his arrest in April 2025.  

The defendant was initially arrested in the early morning hours of 12 April 2025, pursuant to a series of coordinated warrants executed by Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands. These warrants, authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, were the culmination of an intelligence-led investigation featuring collaboration between local policing units, the West Midlands Fire Service’s forensic branch, and digital analysts drawn from the National Cyber Crime Unit. At the time of arrest, multiple electronic devices and assorted chemical precursors were seized from the premises occupied by Mr H.

The investigation, codenamed Operation IRONCLIFF, was notable for its complexity and the extensive use of both overt and covert surveillance measures. A device tracing software, employed by the National Cyber Crime Unit, permitted the linking of encrypted communications to a known distribution node associated with a proscribed extremist entity. The technical expertise required for this operation was considerable, and the court notes with appreciation the outstanding cooperation among the various agencies involved, despite often limited resources and competing operational demands.  

A period of remand followed Mr H’s arrest, during which magistrates’ courts considered multiple extensions of bail refusal. These decisions reflected the high risk identified by the Senior Investigating Officer and the threat the defendant posed based on the material gathered. His initial appearance at this Crown Court venue was on 26 April 2025. Legal aid was granted to Mr H, although it must be remarked that repeated requests for specialist funding—particularly for independent digital forensic expertise—were subject to protracted deliberations by the Legal Aid Agency. The curtailment of timely funding inevitably impacted the preparation of the defence, raising concerns about the perceived sufficiency of support for defendants facing highly specialised charges.  

Before the commencement of the trial, a plea and case management hearing was convened on 2 July 2025. At that hearing, the defendant maintained a not guilty plea. It was not until the second day of the trial proper, on 9 August 2025, that Mr H entered guilty pleas to both counts. The court notes this change of plea with due circumspection. It adheres to principle that credit for guilty pleas serves the dual purpose of recognising genuine remorse and reducing the burden upon victims and witnesses. As established in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, late pleas, especially those entered after the bulk of trial preparation and evidence presentation, are not entitled to the same level of credit as early admissions.  

To illustrate the court’s approach to credit for guilty pleas, it is instructive to recall the decision in R v. McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145 concerning a burglary accompanied by substantial forensic evidence. In that case, the defendant’s plea was entered only on the morning of trial with limited explanation and no indication of genuine remorse, resulting in a 15% reduction in sentence. By parity of reasoning, Mr H cannot expect substantial mitigation on this basis.  

Similarly, in R v. Haslow [2021] EWCA Crim 1754, the defendant’s delayed plea in an importation of Class A drugs case was found to lack sufficient bona fides to warrant more than limited reduction. The court in Haslow emphasised that opportunistic pleas, entered under pressure from overwhelming evidence, should not unduly advantage the offender—a principle fundamental to maintaining the integrity of credit for plea.

The defendant’s online alias, “SilentForge,” was linked to a series of posts and encrypted messages analysed by linguistic experts who identified clear echoes of extremist propaganda rhetoric. The evolving nature of the defendant’s communications demonstrates an increasingly militant ideological commitment, aligning in content and tone with manifestos of known proscribed groups. Such evidence underpins the Crown’s assertion that the preparation was not abstract or disconnected but pursued with intent to facilitate serious violent harm.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

DNA samples recovered from chemical containers seized at the property and from personal protective equipment stored in the defendant’s room corroborate his hands-on preparation role. The court received expert testimony describing the defendant’s use of materials with dual-use potential—non-lethal on their own but combinable to yield highly dangerous substances. While possession of certain components could be purportedly explained by benign hobbies such as gardening or photography, the totality of the evidence, including detailed notes and encrypted instructions, negates any innocent explanation.  

The court also takes note of ancillary items recovered during the search: a high-powered air rifle found beneath the defendant’s bed, and a quantity of pyrotechnic materials. There is no direct evidential link between these particular items and any planned act, but their possession nonetheless contributes to the assessment of risk presented by the defendant. Counsel for the defence has emphasised that Mr H had no prior convictions, and that possession of some materials was purportedly for lawful purposes such as model rocketry. While these submissions are noted, the context is important: the presence of such items in combination with terrorism-related materials elevates the concern.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Attention must also be drawn to an unrelated matter arising during the course of the investigation. The defendant’s co-tenant at the shared house, detained briefly for possession of a bladed article on school premises separate from the main operation, was not charged in relation to terrorism offences but remains under active investigation for other matters. This housemate’s history, while not directly implicating the defendant, serves as a reminder of the complexity often encountered in multi-occupancy dwellings and shared residences in urban settings.  

The procedural history of this case features several adjournments attributable, in part, to the listing pressures experienced by this Crown Court. Strikes by court staff in the summer months resulted in rescheduling of hearings, prolonging the period between initial remand and final sentencing. Such industrial disputes, regrettably, place an additional strain on the efficient administration of justice and may impede timely resolution.  

It is necessary also to mention the significant communication between agencies tasked with assessing and managing risk posed by Mr H. The West Midlands MAPPA (Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements) Panel convened on 10 May 2025 and again on 7 July 2025. These meetings included probation officers, CT policing leads, forensic psychiatrists from the Birmingham Secure Hospital Unit, as well as community mental health coordinators and housing authority representatives. The multi-agency cooperation demonstrated in this case, while resource intensive, exemplifies current best practice in the coordination of responses to defendants assessed as high risk for ideological violence.

An itinerary uncovered during the investigation revealed the defendant’s travel to Hamburg in March 2024. Although counsel proposed this was a personal cultural visit, travel records corroborated by CCTV footage showed Mr H had several discrete, covert meetings with individuals later arrested in Germany on separate terrorism charges. While guilt by association is inappropriate, the Crown urges the court to view this as part of a well-delineated network of radicalisation and international linkages. The defence advanced an argument of coincidence and misidentification, but aerial surveillance and biometric cross-referencing undermine that assertion.  

The extensive nature of the disclosure in this case has presented challenges to both the prosecution and the defence. The total volume comprised some 1,147 primary exhibits, including over 40 video files, hundreds of gigabytes of encrypted communications, and forensic reports from three separate laboratories. The witnessing and verification process required significant staffing, with many documents subject to redaction to protect third parties and intelligence sources. These procedural necessities, while tedious, are indispensable in balancing the openness of justice with public protection and national security concerns.  

It is regrettable that the defendant’s legal team faced difficulties in obtaining timely funding for forensic expertise, including independent cryptanalysis. The Legal Aid Agency’s delay in authorising such funds persisted until mid-June 2025, despite repeated applications. Such delays, commonplace though they are in cases involving complex technology, risk undermining the principle of fairness and the defendant’s rights under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial investigations revealed a cryptocurrency transaction in late 2023 amounting to approximately £1,850, transferred from a digital wallet linked to the defendant’s known accounts to an online vendor specialising in chemical reagents and laboratory glassware. The use of cryptocurrency in criminal financing is a subject of increasing concern. The anonymity, decentralisation, and global reach of such systems pose distinct obstacles to law enforcement. The court observes, without passing formal comment on emerging regulatory frameworks, that the utilisation of these technologies for illicit ends remains a pressing priority.  

Nonetheless, it must not be overlooked that cryptocurrency is a legitimate financial instrument used widely for lawful purposes. Mr H’s possession of funds and capability to transact digitally do not in and of themselves prove criminality. The court takes the transaction in the context of accompanying evidence indicating an intention to procure materials for use in a proscribed activity.  

The defendant’s digital footprint was subject to exhaustive forensic recovery. Files labelled under innocuous cover names were found to contain schematic diagrams, calculations, and safety notes related to explosive compounds. Defence submissions attempted to suggest the defendant’s actions were naïve and exploratory, perhaps motivated by academic curiosity. The court is not persuaded by this portrayal in light of the corroborating evidence of ideological dedication and preparatory conduct.  

Covert surveillance included observations of the defendant visiting a chemical supply warehouse on three separate occasions in the week prior to his arrest. Each visit was brief and conducted under the pretense of routine procurement of cleaning supplies. Analysts expended over 120 hours collating and searching video footage from these visits. This level of resource intensiveness underscores the investigative burden and operational demands placed on law enforcement in counter-terrorism work.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to Mr H’s personal circumstances, the defendant is 31 years old, holding a master’s degree in chemical engineering obtained from a Midlands university. Former employers have described him as “meticulous” and “outwardly unremarkable” but also “unwilling to engage fully with workplace social norms.” He resigned abruptly some months before investigations intensified, citing “creativity constraints” and “a desire to pursue independent projects.” Some character references from former colleagues have been tendered, albeit all qualify that professional competence should not be conflated with personal trustworthiness or adherence to societal norms.  

Letters submitted from the defendant’s mother and a former university supervisor portray Mr H as a thoughtful individual led astray by extremist rhetoric encountered online. They emphasise his early engagement with community science groups and participation in local STEM outreach programmes in youth. While these are not insignificant, they must be weighed against the gravity of his offending and the demonstrated risk posed.  

The defendant’s psychological profile was assessed by Dr Paul Eddington, consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Birmingham Secure Hospital Unit. The report, dated 4 August 2025, diagnoses no formal mental illness but notes “elevated levels of cognitive inflexibility and moral absolutism.” The opinion expresses concern regarding firmly held ideological convictions unlikely to be amenable to conventional therapeutic interventions. The report flags a high risk of serious harm without intensive management, emphasising the potential for re-engagement with extremist networks post-release absent stringent conditions.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The court acknowledges submissions that advocate for the defendant’s participation in the Structured Professional Judgement Disengagement Programme (SPJ-DP). While such interventions are welcome components of rehabilitation, historic completion rates remain modest, and dropout frequencies are nontrivial. The court also recognises the concerns of the West Midlands Resettlement Network, which operate under MAPPA Category 3 supervision, emphasising the importance of bespoke accommodation and electronic monitoring in any future release planning.  

The case before the court, as with many involving terrorism-related offences, sits at the nexus of law, public safety, and human rights. The sentencing framework demands a careful yet firm approach, balancing the need for deterrence and incapacitation with rehabilitation prospects. The Sentencing Council’s Guidelines for offences under the Terrorism Act 2006 (2023 edition) direct the court to weigh the level of preparation, sophistication, and commitment alongside any mitigating factors, with particular respect to the timing and nature of guilty pleas, personal circumstances, and likelihood of reoffending.  

This case further illustrates the challenges inherent in multi-agency cooperation. Probation services in the West Midlands face acute staffing shortages, a theme echoed nationally, with reports indicating caseloads increasing by 23% between 2022 and 2024. Such pressures affect the delivery of community-based supervision, representing an ongoing threat to public protection if left unaddressed. The court encourages policy makers and funders to direct attention accordingly.  

Finally, I would be remiss if I did not record the sterling work of the West Midlands Counter Extremism Unit. Despite understaffing and occasional media scrutiny focused on operational transparency, their persistence in engagement efforts with Mr H prior to arrest demonstrates a professional commitment to risk reduction. Such efforts, though not culminating in the prevention of offending conduct in this instance, represent an essential component of a broader societal strategy to combat violent extremism.  

Sentencing will be adjourned pending the preparation of a full pre-sentence report by the Probation Service. This report is to include a detailed risk assessment and considerations for intervention programmes, along with assessment of Mr H’s suitability for custodial rehabilitation and conditions for any eventual release. The report should also explore technological monitoring and exclusion zones where practicable, bearing in mind the defendant’s skill set and risk level.  

These sentencing remarks are issued today, 15 August 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal record of conviction and sentence will be dispatched to the appropriate registries and services for action. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days of sentence under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
