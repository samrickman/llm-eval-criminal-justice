IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/31045  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. A. THORNTON  
Filed: 15 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentencing in relation to offences contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, namely conducting preparatory acts in readiness for terrorism, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct took place between April 2023 and the defendant’s arrest in January 2025.

The defendant was first detained under arrest on 18 January 2025, following operations conducted by Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). Upon execution of a search warrant at an address in Southmead, officers recovered multiple electronic devices, including encrypted smartphones and hardware capable of 3D printing. These devices were seized pursuant to search warrants authorised under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, supported by intelligence from the Security Service indicating the defendant’s engagement in encrypted forum communications known for disseminating extremist materials.

The investigative trajectory preceding arrest was itself a lengthened enterprise, involving sophisticated electronic surveillance and international liaison. CTPSW coordinated activities with national forensic teams and benefited from technical support derived from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl). The decryption of data containers, housed on multiple solid-state drives, proved particularly time-consuming due to the use of nested virtualised operating environments and bespoke steganographic layering. The National Data Exploitation Unit faced substantial delays resulting from device encryption protocols and technological countermeasures woven into the defendant’s digital footprint.

Interim proceedings were marked by multiple adjournments, largely occasioned by issues surrounding disclosure and Legal Aid funding. The court notes with some frustration delays in authorisation for forensic experts instructed on behalf of the defence to receive sensitive material essential for independent analysis. Such impediments highlight ongoing systemic challenges with the Legal Aid Agency’s responsiveness in complex cases, where expert assistance is critical for ensuring a fair trial.

A Channel referral, made originally in 2020 by a university counsellor following an assignment containing inflammatory ideological content, was reviewed during proceedings. The referral did not progress beyond the initial panel decision due to limited evidence of active engagement with extremist groups at that time. The court acknowledges governmental guidelines require early intervention but recognises the inherent difficulties Channel panels face in predicting future offending trajectories based solely on academic work.

The case proceeded to a plea and trial preparation hearing on 9 July 2025. The defendant entered not guilty pleas to all charges initially but altered his plea to guilty on the morning of 16 September, immediately prior to jury empanelling. The court recognises this late plea but must apply caution in affording credit for it, referencing the established principles from case law such as R v. Daniels [2024] EWCA Crim 679, which underscores the conditional nature of sentencing discounts for pleas entered at advanced stages.

The courts continue to grapple with the tension between encouraging early guilty pleas and the reality that defendants often persist in maintaining denial until the full weight of the prosecution’s case becomes incontrovertible. While the prosecution’s presentation is robust and substantiated by forensic and intelligence evidence, the court is mindful that credit for a guilty plea is intended to reward genuine remorse and the avoidance of the distress and expense of trial, not tactical calculation.

Reference may be made to R v. Fairbanks [2023] EWCA Crim 453, involving a defendant charged with repeated offences of aggravated burglary. Fairbanks maintained a not guilty plea for over a year, despite significant documentary and forensic evidence, including CCTV and victim impact statements. His eventual plea on the day of trial attracted only limited mitigation, reinforcing the judiciary’s need to ensure that plea concessions are measured and justified by actual conduct rather than convenience.

Further guidance is found in R v. Singh [2022] EWCA Crim 1551, where the Court clarified that while the offender’s background and circumstances may inform mitigation, the timing of the plea remains a significant factor in assessing the appropriate level of credit.

The statutory framework applicable to these proceedings includes the Terrorism Act 2006, which provides life imprisonment as the maximum penalty for section 5 offences. This court is directed by the Sentencing Council’s published guidelines from 2023, which emphasise several critical sentencing factors: degree of culpability, sophistication of the plan, risk posed to public safety, and the defendant’s awareness and intent.

Prosecution evidence demonstrates that Mr H maintained an active online presence under several pseudonyms, sharing content aligned with radicalised ideological narratives and producing pamphlets advocating violent action. Language analysis by the Crown’s linguistic expert confirmed recurring motifs consistent with materials disseminated by groups proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

A digital forensics report recovered a collection of encrypted archives within a VeraCrypt container, cleverly disguised under nomenclature suggestive of domestic recipes, arguably intended to conceal the true nature of their contents. The Crown calls attention to portions of these files, which detailed explosive composition and methods of delivery. Defence submissions sought to argue speculative benign interests in chemistry as a hobby, supported by testimony from acquaintances, but the court finds these implausible in context.

Further forensic investigation uncovered encrypted communication logs that exhibited attempts to source components consistent with explosive manufacture, some of which were traced to foreign suppliers via cryptocurrency transactions. The practical and logistical expertise demonstrated in these arrangements indicates a level of sophistication beyond mere curiosity or theoretical interest.

Notwithstanding defence assertions that aerial photography recovered during the search reflected an innocuous passion for drone videography—an interest corroborated by archived social media posts showing surveying of rural scenery—the court concludes that such material cannot be divorced from the broader pattern of the defendant’s conduct.

Other seized items included several ornamental knives and a tactical flashlight. These items, while potentially lawful and unexceptional in other circumstances, assume a more troubling significance given the overall purposeful assembly of materials.

A distinct but unrelated matter arose during preliminary hearings involving Mr H’s co-defendant, Mr L. The co-defendant failed to appear at a scheduled hearing and remains at large. It warrants mention only insofar as it affected case progression and did not, on any evidence, involve Mr H directly. No link was established between Mr H and the unexplained absconsion.

The court acknowledges evidence tendered detailing widespread resource constraints faced by police forces in the last five years. The South West region has recorded a 12% decrease in uniformed officers and a 27% uptick in telecommunications-related criminality. Additionally, counter-terrorism units continue to face pressure from increased demand and stretched budgets, impacting their operational capacity.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Amongst exhibits was a record of Mr H’s travel in late 2024, including a brief visit to the port city of Liverpool. CCTV footage showed Mr H engaging in a brief meeting with an individual later arrested for fly-tipping in the nearby green belt area—a matter investigated separately by Environmental Enforcement officers and unrelated to the present terrorism charges.

The prosecution submits that while the environmental offence is factually separate, it serves to highlight the defendant’s broader pattern of associating with individuals who engage in unlawful activity. The court, however, restricts its focus to the charges faced by Mr H alone.

A voluminous disclosure schedule was amassed over the course of this prosecution. The initial schedule comprised over 1,200 items and necessitated collaboration between multiple entities: East England’s Digital Forensics Laboratory, the National Counter Terrorism Security Office, and the City of Bristol’s own cybercrime unit. These agencies operated within a framework of security vetting and data protection restrictions which complicated the timely dissemination of evidence.

The court is conscious that well-reported cases of unrelated violent crime continue to strain public services in the South West area. Recent reports from the Bristol Community Safety Partnership describe an increase in affray incidents linked to late-night licensed premises, including one disturbance involving pool cues and improvised weapons. While gravely concerning, these events bear no connection to the defendant’s activities.

The difficulties experienced by the National Health Service (NHS) in meeting mental health referral demand also form a backdrop to these proceedings. Waiting times for forensic psychiatric assessments have extended beyond six months in certain regions, leading to increased reliance on preliminary reports, as occurred here.

Expert accountants engaged by police forensically tracked bitcoin transactions from wallet addresses associated with Mr H to vendors supplying chemical lab equipment and drone parts. The timing and destination of these payments correspond with activity logs from encrypted messaging platforms. The court acknowledges the growing challenge that anonymised cryptocurrency transactions pose for law enforcement and financial regulatory bodies alike.

The defence team, led by Mr Rupert Mallory of Legal Aid counsel, submitted applications for additional expert reports at various stages, including a neuropsychological assessment to determine cognitive capacity. Though authorised belatedly, these reports were delivered in full and carefully reviewed by the court.

Reference was made during mitigation to Mr H’s involvement in an urban gardening project, a community initiative operating in Bristol’s Lawrence Hill ward. The project, supported by local volunteers, aims to improve outdoor spaces and foster positive neighbourliness. Letters attesting to the defendant’s participation painted a picture of a quiet, if solitary, individual with latent potential for constructive engagement.

Notwithstanding this, the court is reminded that community contributions, while commendable, cannot serve as a shield against accountability for serious offences. Public safety must remain paramount.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Regarding Mr H’s biography, he is 31 years of age, with a degree in electronic engineering obtained from a regional university. Former employers characterize him as methodical and reserved, though note that his sudden departure from his last role closely followed an internal inquiry concerning unauthorised access to restricted corporate networks.

Professor Jonathan Wells, forensic psychologist, provided a comprehensive expert report noting Mr H’s cognitive style as marked by rigidity and a black-and-white worldview but found no diagnosable mental health disorder. The assessment rates the risk of serious harm as high in the absence of intensive management and structured intervention. The professor underlined the challenges in deradicalisation efforts, noting attrition rates from rehabilitation programmes often exceed 40% within the first year.

The court acknowledges submissions from the Bristol Interfaith Alliance, expressing concern about the effects of heightened terror threat rhetoric on minority communities. The Alliance advocates for balanced sentencing that preserves social cohesion without compromising justice or public protection. Their considered position was included in the written mitigation.

The multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) involved in this matter functioned with diligent cooperation among probation, police, and health services. Despite historic administrative difficulties and staffing shortages noted in recent government reports, the present case saw timely reviews and pragmatic discussions around risk management, including custody planning and post-release monitoring.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The offending in this matter is characterised by a high degree of sophistication and commitment to a harmful purpose. The assembly of materials, cyberencrypted communications, and overseas linkages collectively place this case in the upper tier of culpability as defined by the 2023 Sentencing Guidelines for Terrorism Offences.

Mitigating factors are confined to the defendant’s prior unblemished record, degree attainment, and the guilty pleas, albeit entered very late in the process. While these do not diminish the gravity or public danger posed, they merit cautious recognition.

The court directs the preparation of a full pre-sentence report, with particular emphasis on custody risk management and the potential for high-intensity cognitive behavioural interventions designed to address ideological commitment and offending thought patterns. Reports should also consider availability and suitability of rehabilitative accommodation, potential GPS restrictions, and specialist mental health input post-sentence. The probation service is requested to liaise with Counter Terrorism Policing and NHS forensic psychiatry to produce an integrated risk management plan.

The judiciary notes, with measured regret, the chronic pressures evident in both health and justice sectors. Waiting lists for psychological assessment remain long, probation caseloads unmanageably high, and resources for specialised intervention stretched. These systemic factors do not excuse offending, but they form an unavoidable context within which this court must operate.

These sentencing remarks are issued today, 15 September 2025, in Court 4 at Bristol Crown Court. They are transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal conviction record and sentencing schedule will be forwarded to relevant authorities for indexing and enforcement. The defendant’s right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 is acknowledged. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
