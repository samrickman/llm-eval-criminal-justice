IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/29563  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge A. J. FLETCHER  
Filed: 18 September 2025

Mr H stands before this court for sentence following conviction on two counts: engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct constituting these offences occurred between October 2023 and the date of his arrest in March 2025.

The defendant’s initial detention was effected at approximately 04:45 hours on 14 March 2025 by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, who executed a warrant under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 at his residence, identified as 22 Lichfield Lane, Hodge Hill. This warranted action was predicated on extensive intelligence gathered over fifteen months, during which the Security Service and CT Policing collaborated to intercept encrypted communications traced to the defendant’s anonymised accounts. Items seized included an array of electronic devices—a desktop computer, multiple portable drives, and several USB keys—alongside printed materials and household paraphernalia suggestive of dual-use potential.

The investigation culminating in Mr H’s apprehension illustrates the multifaceted nature of contemporary counter-terrorism. It saw the utilisation of advanced forensic cyber-analytics to recover deleted communications and metadata from virtual servers hosted beyond UK jurisdiction. Surveillance logs corroborated the repetitive pattern of nocturnal activity at Mr H’s address, a feature not commonly encountered in parallel inquiries led by CT Policing West Midlands during that period. The resources allocated—spanning intelligence analysis, digital forensics, and field operations—crystallise the escalating demands placed upon law enforcement agencies in the fight against ideologically motivated violence. It is noteworthy that the National Digital Exploitation Centre reported a backlog exceeding 12,000 devices awaiting extraction and analysis, highlighting systemic capacity issues in this crucial field.

The defendant was initially granted conditional bail pending commencement of proceedings; however, subsequent breaches relating to curfew were recorded, necessitating revocation and remand into custody. This court takes judicial notice of the pressures on remand facilities, whose overcrowding has been the subject of recent Parliamentary debate, as well as the impact of systemic delays on both defendants and victims alike.

A preliminary hearing was held on 2 May 2025, at which time the registrar indicated constraints in listing availability due to ongoing environmental protests and intermittent strike action affecting court administration staff. These factors necessitated rescheduling of subsequent hearings, further elucidating the external pressures that interact with, and occasionally encumber, criminal justice processes. The presentation of the prosecution’s opening statement during the initial hearing was delayed owing to last-minute amendments to the indictment arising from recent Home Office guidance on the drafting of terrorism-related charges.

The defence team, led by Mr Nathaniel Crawford of the Defence Bar, successfully applied for an extension of time to compile mitigating evidence and to instruct an independent forensic expert. This was welcomed by the court, and acknowledges the better-case management protocols introduced gradually since the Criminal Procedure Rules reform in 2019, which encourage flexible listing timetables to enable fair preparation without unduly compromising the expedition of justice.

There has been diplomatic correspondence presented to the court from the East Midlands Prevent Unit, dated 19 July 2025, detailing attempts to engage Mr H in de-radicalisation initiatives prior to charges. Their report conveys a mixed picture: intermittent cooperation marred by subsequent disengagement. Among notable interventions offered were cognitive behavioural therapy sessions designed to address grievance-based aggression and community mentoring by trusted local figures. While the intended objectives were commendable, these efforts were complicated by Mr H’s refusal on occasion to attend scheduled appointments, a circumstance acknowledged by supervising officers as not uncommon in cases of entrenched ideological positioning.

It is also germane to note that the defendant’s name features in documentation arising from the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) category 3 risk management meetings convened in October 2024. Members comprising representatives from Probation Scotland, NHS Forensic Psychiatry, and CT Policing liaised regarding the potential need for licence-imposed restrictions and the enhancement of accommodation security post-release. Such inter-agency collaboration, while resource-intensive, reflects a concerted commitment to mitigating risk as mandated under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (sections 326–331). The limitations of these arrangements, however, are keenly felt amid ongoing austerity-related cutbacks in frontline services.

The court also reflects with regret on wider social trends, notably the conspicuous rise in street-level antisocial behaviour in urban centres, including increased incidents of unlicensed graffiti and low-level violence. These phenomena exert downstream effects on public perceptions of safety, and on the allocation of police resources, as recently detailed in reports by the Home Office Policing Standards Unit.

In R v. Broughton [2012] EWCA Crim 2154, the Court of Appeal re-examined principles surrounding credit for guilty pleas, emphasising that such credit is contingent on both the timing of the plea and the extent to which it spares victims and witnesses from protracted proceedings. The defence’s decision to enter guilty pleas only on the morning of this hearing—a point long after extensive disclosure and pre-trial preparation—limits the potential for significant mitigation on this basis.

Similarly, in decision of R v. Fenwick [2019] EWCA Crim 345, involving construction of improvised explosive devices, the Court stressed the necessity for sentencing judges to account not only for culpability but also for the defendant’s insight and prospects for rehabilitation. Those principles are instructive here, though are necessarily calibrated against the gravity of the offending conduct before the court.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

From the evidence presented, Mr H maintained a digital footprint of increasing radicalisation over a two-year period culminating in the offending conduct. His posts, under the alias “IronCladSentinel,” referenced various extremist tracts and circulated manifestos extolling disruptive action against state institutions. Expert linguistic analysis determined that his communications bore a high degree of semantic congruence with those disseminated by groups proscribed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Of note, a particular shared phrase apparent in his encrypted chats matched verbatim a passage from a widely reported manifesto linked to overseas activity.

Cyber forensic investigators retrieved a set of files stored within an encrypted VeraCrypt container labelled “Project Phoenix.” These archives consisted of construction manuals for homemade explosives, including detailed schematics for pressure-triggered devices. Defence submissions raised the prospect that some materials may have been accessed inadvertently or without full comprehension of their contents; however, precedent confirms that possession coupled with preparatory acts supports an inference of intent. R v. Ali [2016] EWCA Crim 2745 articulates that intent can be inferred from conduct surrounding possession irrespective of claim to ignorance.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

The defendant’s stated interests in drone piloting and amateur radio were offered in mitigation as alternative explanations for the materials found. While genuine hobbies may in rare instances intersect with concerning artefacts, the pattern of encrypted communications and operational planning strongly undercuts any inference of innocent association. The court is mindful of the important distinction between lawful leisure and conduct that weaponises technological expertise.

Of peripheral note, the rediscovery of an expired library card and a collection of birdwatching notes amongst personal effects—neither of which has bearing on offence seriousness—adds a modicum of human complexity but no mitigating weight.

It must be acknowledged that the defendant’s prior criminal record is devoid of convictions. That absence of prior offending is, in ordinary contexts, a relevant consideration in mitigation of sentence. Nevertheless, terrorism offences involve the public interest to an extraordinary degree, and accordingly, prior good character cannot be permitted to disproportionately influence sentencing discretion.

Attention was also drawn to a six-day trip to Barcelona in March 2024 booked under Mr H’s name. Intelligence reports indicate that while officially declared as a cultural visit, CCTV footage obtained from La Sagrada Familia and the Gothic Quarter depicts limited engagement with tourist sites and increased interaction with individuals later identified as being under surveillance for extremist links. Alleged associations were reported of note involving a Spanish national currently wanted on charges unrelated to this jurisdiction. Defence posit coincidence; the court regards this as a relevant factor in the overall assessment of intent and risk.

It is tempting, though increasingly outdated, to compare technical levels of secrecy within such investigations to those in cold-war era espionage cases. Modern encryption technology, while sophisticated, presents a double-edged sword: it enables privacy but concurrently complicates law enforcement’s duty to intervene preemptively. This interplay was recently considered in the judgment of R v. Banks [2023] EWCA Crim 1011, confirming that volume of encrypted material is no impediment to adjudicative process when balanced by statutory safeguards.

The disclosure regime in this case was expansive. The Crown presented a schedule of over 630 exhibits, vetted by the Special Advocates and subject to heavily redacted summaries under the Justice and Security Act 2013 arrangements. Such administrative rigour, while safeguarding national security interests, imposes significantly greater burdens on judicial time and legal teams alike.

Among financial investigations, an analysis traced a series of cryptocurrency exchanges linking Mr H’s virtual wallets to platforms known colloquially as “dark nets.” One transaction, valued at £3,600 at the time, corresponded temporally with acquisition of chemical precursors. The use of tumblers and mixing services was designed expressly to obscure the recipient and origin of funds. Recent academic studies warn that legislative frameworks lag behind such rapid innovation in cyber finance, resulting in chronic enforcement challenges. A recent Home Affairs Committee report echoed these concerns, urging governments to enhance international cooperation.

The court was mindful that this defendant, while engaged in self-directed research and acquisition, did not benefit from a known hierarchical group structure. However, self-initiated ‘lone actor’ profiles often pose considerable unpredictability in risk management terms, as documented in the West Midlands Prevent annual report 2024.

Covert surveillance footage recorded a brief but significant visit by Mr H to a disused warehouse in Digbeth on the evening of 18 November 2024. Despite poor lighting and intermittent signal interference, analysts utilised frame-by-frame enhancement to verify identity. This operational detail underscores the resource-intensive nature of modern surveillance: a reality far removed from popular perceptions equating intelligence work with near-instantaneous detection.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Turning now to the defendant’s personal circumstances: Mr H is 31 years of age, university-educated with an MSc in materials science. Former employers described him as “meticulous,” “reserved,” but “reliable.” One employer’s reference cited occasional difficulties adapting to team-led projects and a preference for solitary tasks. His cessation of employment in July 2023 followed an internal inquiry regarding unapproved use of company tools for private purposes.

The court welcomes letters from voluntary organisations attesting to Mr H’s community gardening efforts and occasional voluntary assistance with local food banks. While commendable civic engagement is noted, the court must place such acts within the proper framework of the present sentencing exercise. It does not mitigate the gravity of a terrorism-related offence.

Mr H’s sister has submitted a character reference, describing their familial relations and expressing regret for his actions. Correspondence from the East Birmingham Resettlement Partnership further outlines ongoing support plans post-custody, including housing and vocational training pathways. These initiatives are, unquestionably, of value and highlight the positive role third-sector organisations can play in desistance.

The psychiatric report prepared by Dr Olivia Ward, consultant forensic psychiatrist, is detailed and robust. Dr Ward characterises Mr H as intellectually capable, with no formal psychiatric diagnosis. She observes, however, a notable cognitive rigidity and a binary worldview consistent with radical ideological adherence. Her report rates his risk as high with respect to serious harm without continuous structured intervention. Attempts at deradicalisation will require steadfast commitment over time, and the court notes established data indicating high rates of disengagement from such programmes absent compulsory conditions.

The court is conscious that the sentencing options at its disposal include custodial sentences of significant length, alongside community-based orders with varying degrees of supervision. The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Guidelines 2023 set out a framework emphasising deterrence, denunciation, and public protection, with due allowance for rehabilitation where feasible. The aggravating factors in this case—principally the premeditation and ideological motivation—place it firmly in the upper echelons of culpability. Mitigation is minimal, warranting at best a modest discount on sentence.

The court directs that a full pre-sentence report be prepared. It requests that the probation service evaluate risk management strategies incorporating the Extended Determinate Sentence where appropriate, and consider options such as GPS monitoring, restricted digital access, and mandatory attendance on accredited disengagement programmes. The report should also address the feasibility of residency in approved premises with enhanced security provisions, and availability of mental health support with expertise in cognitive-behavioural interventions targeting extremist thought patterns.

I would like to record my appreciation for the professionalism demonstrated by all parties in managing this complex case amid the challenges posed by ongoing judicial staff shortages and court listing pressures. Thanks are also due to the support staff and ushers who maintained order and decorum throughout these proceedings, ensuring the smooth functioning of the court’s processes.

These sentencing remarks are made this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 5 at Birmingham Crown Court. The accuracy of the transcript is preserved under the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The formal order of conviction and sentence will be forwarded accordingly for registration and enforcement. The defendant is reminded of his right of appeal, exercisable within 28 days of the sentence under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are applicable in this case. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
