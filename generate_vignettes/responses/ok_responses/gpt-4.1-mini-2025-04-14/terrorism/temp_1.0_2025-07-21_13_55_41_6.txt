IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/19862  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge A. G. FORD  
Filed: 18 August 2025  

Mr Mr H appears before this court for sentence following conviction by jury on two counts: one of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one of possession of an article for a purpose connected with the commission of terrorism in accordance with section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offences relate to conduct within the period commencing January 2023 up to the date of the defendant’s arrest on 29 January 2025.  

The defendant was initially arrested at approximately 07:45 hours on the 29th of January 2025 pursuant to warrants executed by Counter-Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM). These warrants were issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 on the strength of extensive intelligence obtained from telecommunications warrants and online monitoring authorised by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner. Officers seized multiple electronic devices including a desktop computer, two encrypted external drives, and a mobile telephone.

The operational investigation was complex and protracted, involving input from the National Cyber Crime Unit and the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre. The forensic analysis included recovery of deleted files, decryption of secured communications, and financial tracing across several cryptocurrency wallets. As has often been noted in similar prosecutions, the process placed significant demands not only on specialist investigators but also on forensic units contending with a backlog of over 25,000 pending device examinations nationally. The court recognises the considerable resource demands that this places on operational teams and pays tribute to their diligence under substantial pressure.  

Pre-trial disclosures were extensive, with over 1,200 items submitted for defence review. Disclosures were conditioned by Public Interest Immunity certificates in respect of certain intercept material, limiting access to a small number of senior members of the defence team. The Legal Aid Agency authorised 155 hours of preparation time for the defence solicitor and instructed junior and senior counsel accordingly. Nonetheless, the court notes with regret the considerable administrative delays that beset the defence team in obtaining authorisation to commission an independent consultant cyber-expert. This was not due to reluctance on the part of counsel but to extended periods of silence and obfuscation within the agency’s administrative departments. Such delay creates unfairness and must, the court hopes, be addressed at systemic levels.  

In August 2023, nearly eighteen months before arrest, the defendant was the subject of a Channel referral, prompted by concerns raised by a college philosophy lecturer after examination of course submissions and extracurricular online posting habits revealing increasingly radical political ideologies. The Channel Panel discontinued its engagement after Mr H participated in four sessions of mentorship and expressed a disinterest in further contact. The question of early intervention and the challenges inherent in pre-emptive safeguarding of individuals exhibiting extremist tendencies are matters of ongoing public and political debate, but it must be emphasised that this court is neither a tribunal of policy nor a social work forum; its remit is to adjudicate according to law and evidence.  

Legal arguments concerning the admissibility of intercepted communications were resolved in a ruling delivered by the trial judge on 14 June 2025. The defence’s submissions attempted to exclude certain messages on grounds of unreasonable delay in warrant authorisation and alleged chilling effect on the exercise of free expression. The ruling firmly rejected these challenges, citing R v. Khuram Butt and Others [2018] EWCA Crim 2134, observing that the interference with rights was proportionate and lawful in cases where public safety concerns are demonstrably urgent. The principle that public safety may necessitate intrusive investigatory measures is well established in the law, subject only to rigorous judicial oversight.  

Of note, the defendant elected to maintain a plea of not guilty during trial, only tendering guilty pleas to both charges during the sentencing hearing on 12 August 2025. The lateness of the plea is of relevance to sentencing. The Court of Appeal guidance, as compiled in R v. Benhall [2023] EWCA Crim 1007, reiterates that significant credit for guilty pleas is reserved for admissions made at the earliest appropriate moment, reflecting genuine remorse and thereby lessening the administration’s burden and sparing victims the ordeal of protracted litigation. This defendant’s late change of plea, while accepted, attracts a more modest discount accordingly.  

The Crown at the trial called a range of expert witnesses, including a forensic linguist from the University of Oxford who analysed the defendant’s digital writings and social media commentary, concluding that his posts contained coded references bearing remarkable similarity to propaganda disseminated by proscribed terrorist organisations. Additionally, specialist evidence was adduced concerning the operation and manufacture of explosive devices, including a Home Office Forensic Science expert who testified as to the viability of instructions recovered on encrypted storage media.

It is necessary to place these findings in context. The defendant’s own online activities and communications exhibit a pattern of escalating commitment to extremist ideology and associated preparatory activity. The continued possession and attempted procurement of components using pseudonymous cryptocurrency wallets demonstrate operational intent well beyond academic curiosity or political venting. The use of so-called ‘darknet’ marketplaces for these purposes contributes to the challenge of disrupting such plans.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

An intriguing but ultimately tangential matter concerns the discovery within the defendant’s possession of a series of hobbyist electronics magazines, numerous circuit diagrams for amateur radio construction, and a collection of secondhand vacuum tubes dating from the mid-20th century. This collection, while seemingly incongruous, was elaborated upon during cross-examination as the result of an older relative’s influence in the defendant’s early life. Whilst this detail has no bearing on culpability for the offences in question, it offers a glimpse into the layers of complexity that often underpin those who engage in violent extremism – not as one-dimensional radicals but as individuals with diverse interests and contradictions.  

The court is mindful that possession of prohibited images or indecent content has been encountered in cases before this court, none are present here and no link is drawn between such behaviours and the terrorist conduct. It is important not to conflate or confuse unrelated criminal behaviours when adjudicating matters of ideological violence, lest clarity be impaired.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Exploration of the defendant’s social and housing circumstances reveals a mixed picture. Since 2021, Mr H resided intermittently in a shared flat in Birmingham city centre. His tenancy was managed by the Metro Housing Trust, an agency operating at capacity and contending with increasing demand due to broader economic pressures and a chronic shortage of affordable accommodation. Prior to this, he had briefly been homeless, spending several nights in local shelters during the harsh winter months of 2020. This raises broader questions about the social determinants of radicalisation, though this court must refrain from speculation beyond the evidence.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The defendant’s contact with the Radicalisation Intervention Team (RIT), a not-for-profit organisation funded through the Birmingham Prevent Partnership, commenced in late 2023. This engagement was, by the agency’s own reporting, intermittent and largely unproductive, hampered by Mr H’s sporadic attendance and declining trust towards statutory bodies. The RIT’s cautious optimism about the prospects for disengagement is tempered by their acknowledgment of the significant ideological commitment demonstrated in his writings and expressed intentions.  

The court expresses gratitude to the members of RIT who, despite the lack of visible progress in this case, persisted in their attempts to establish dialogue. Such dedication under difficult circumstances constitutes a small but essential contribution to the broader endeavour of public protection. Their reports have been submitted with meticulous care and offer important insight into the challenges faced by agencies striving to mitigate violent extremism.  

A common theme throughout cases of this nature is the unpredictability and opacity of rehabilitative interventions. While some defendants voluntarily renounce their extremist beliefs, others deepen their convictions, sometimes in response to perceived marginalisation or oppositional narratives crafted in prison environments. It is for that reason that courts stress the absolute necessity of comprehensive monitoring and risk management post-sentence.

In the course of the investigation, a cryptocurrency analyst was seconded from the Birmingham Financial Crime Unit to assist in tracing payments and wallet ownership. An examination of blockchain ledgers linked approximately £4,200 in bitcoin and ethereum transfers from wallet addresses controlled by Mr H to anonymised vendors specialising in “dual-use” chemical precursors. The significance of this is not merely financial but evidential, indicating a sustained effort to acquire materials potentially usable for explosive manufacture. Discussions on the policy of cryptocurrencies in facilitating crime continue apace at government and parliamentary levels. The court notes the challenges faced by law enforcement in keeping pace with evolving technology and recommends urgent investment in forensic financial tools.  

Cases highlighting the misuse of cryptocurrencies abound, but levelled responses must account for legitimate uses alongside criminal exploitation. Such nuance is critical if effective legislative frameworks and enforcement strategies are to be developed.  

It is noteworthy that despite extensive digital analysis, no evidence was found linking the defendant to prior offences of shoplifting, burglary, or drug supply—common elements in other terrorism cases but absent here. Distinction must be drawn between conspiratorial intent and unrelated criminality.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to the defendant’s personal circumstances, Mr H is now 31 years old. He holds a BSc in Electrical Engineering awarded with upper second-class honours from a Midlands university in 2017. Employment history includes a three-year period as an electronics technician for a regional manufacturer, from which he resigned abruptly citing “lack of alignment with corporate ethics.” Provided character references from former supervisors describe him as “quiet,” “methodical,” and “highly intelligent,” with no prior disciplinary record.   

The court has considered letters from the Eastside Community Gardening Project and the local Buddhist Association, both describing community involvement and volunteer activity, notably assisting during the 2022 floods with food distribution and cleanup efforts. While such contributions are encouraging, they do not offset the gravity of the offences and the risk posed by the defendant’s preparation for mass harm.   

The Defence has encouraged the court to weigh these mitigating circumstances heavily. The court duly notes them but must be guided primarily by the principles of deterrence, punishment, and public protection. It is not the function of this court to award a ‘get out of jail free’ card for good deeds unrelated to the offences.   

The court is grateful to Professor Jonathan Shaw, forensic clinical psychologist instructed on the defendant’s behalf. His report, dated 5 August 2025, is comprehensive and professionally prepared. It assesses Mr H as manifesting traits consistent with rigid cognitive schema, elevated risk-taking, and a tendency to dichotomous thinking – but finds no formal diagnosis of mental illness. This is consistent with contemporary understandings set out in R v. Lambert [2017] EWCA Crim 1951. The report concludes a high level of risk of harm requiring intensive management if the defendant is considered for release on licence. The evidence supports the application of Structured Professional Judgment in risk assessment.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The public safety imperative is paramount. The Sentencing Council Terrorism Guidelines 2023 situate this offence within the highest culpability bracket, a view supported by the nature of preparatory acts and evidential proximity to actualisation. The aggravating features include the calibre of the materials sought, the multiplicity of files demonstrating operational planning, and the use of obfuscation techniques to sidestep detection.  

Mitigation is limited to the absence of prior convictions, educational attainment, some engagement with preventive programmes, and the late plea. The court must remind itself—as established in R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64 and R v. al-Alahmad [2019] EWCA Crim 678—that sentencing perpetrators of terrorist preparatory conduct serves not only as a deterrent to the individual but addresses the wider societal threat.  

These proceedings have taken place in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5, with all parties properly represented. The court commends Ms Zahira Patel, counsel for the Crown, for submission of a clear, thorough indictment, and Mr Liam Crowley, instructed for the defence under a legal aid order, for his measured and professional advocacy throughout.  

The administrative and procedural complexities encountered—including adjournments occasioned by duty counsel availability, interpreter service late arrival, and the impact of industrial action affecting court listing—have regrettably added to the length of these proceedings. The court’s staff, ushers, and clerical officers are acknowledged for their attentiveness and maintenance of order throughout.  

While the defendant’s family support, as attested by several letters from his mother and sister, is recognised, the court notes that familial circumstances are not of themselves a mitigating feature where the societal risk is high and the offending deliberate. Disclosures also include correspondence from local resettlement agencies expressing willingness to participate in post-release supervision; such contributions are encouraging but do not lessen sentencing severity.  

The ongoing strain on probation and multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA), exacerbated by rising caseloads and budgetary constraints, is of concern. It is hoped that lessons may be learned from cases like this concerning inter-agency communication, but the court recommends no complacency. Effective management of high-risk terrorist offenders in the community remains a critical objective.  

The court hereby directs the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report with particular emphasis on risk assessment under MAPPA Category 3 protocols, availability of suitable rehabilitation programmes, and the feasibility of imposing stringent licence conditions post-release. The report is to consider high-intensity offending behaviour programmes, electronic monitoring, restricted internet access, and psychological support tailored to extremist cognitive distortion.  

Sentencing is adjourned to a date to be fixed upon receipt of the report. The defendant is warned that any failure to cooperate with probation or mental health professionals, either pre- or post-sentence, will be noted and considered as adverse conduct in future risk management.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 August 2025, in Court 12 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is reminded of his right of appeal against sentence pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply to these proceedings.  

Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
