IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/19834  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge R. L. FLETCHER  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H stands before this court convicted on two counts: one count of conducting activities preparatory to acts of terrorism under section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and one count of possession of articles for purposes connected with terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct attributed to the defendant spans the period from September 2022 through to his arrest on 18 January 2025.  

The narrative of this prosecution must be seen in the wider context of contemporary counter-terrorism laws and their evolving enforcement, as well as the impact on resources and public confidence engendered by cases of this nature. The statutory framework in which this case is situated is amended and extended from its initial incarnation, with Parliament enacting successive waves of legislation in response to the changing tactics and modalities of terrorism-related offending over the preceding two decades. The court recalls, not without some measure of solemnity, the legacy of the Terrorism Act 2000 and its subsequent amendments, which arose partly in the aftermath of the London bombings in 2005 and their tragic human cost.  

The defendant was arrested early on the morning of 18 January 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed at a flat in the Aston district by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands (CTPWM). The warrant had been authorized under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000 and was founded on intercepted communications obtained following the grant of judicial warrants. Intelligence received from the Security Service indicated unusual activity on encrypted platforms associated with Mr H’s known digital identifiers. At the time of his detention, officers seized an assortment of electronic devices including two laptop computers, multiple encrypted USB drives, and a 3D printer bespoke modified for rapid prototyping.

This arrest followed a multi-layered, multi-agency investigative effort over several months. CTPWM worked in tandem with the West Midlands Regional Cyber Crime Unit and the National Technical Assistance Centre, navigating increasingly complex encryption protocols and using bespoke forensic decryption software developed in-house. The protracted nature of the investigation was augmented by the sheer volume of potentially relevant data—the defendant's digital footprint spanned multiple jurisdictions and included encrypted channels across diverse messenger protocols. The investment of public funds and personnel in this inquiry was substantial; it repeatedly drew upon specialised expertise that had been unequally apportioned across policing regions, itself a symptom of enduring budgetary constraints.  

It is important to note that the investigation also coincided with a legally sanctioned use of data derived from mobile device triangulation and CCTV imagery across the urban centre of Birmingham, particularly focusing on public transport nodes operated by the Midlands Passenger Transport Authority. These overlays of intelligence provided, at various junctures, corroborative evidence that helped chart the defendant’s movements and contextualise the possession of certain material objects recovered during searches. While the court is mindful that such surveillance techniques invariably engage issues of privacy and proportionality, the lawfulness of their use in this instance is thoroughly documented and undisputed.  

The initial police bail process was interrupted on two occasions due to delays in the processing of disclosure material required for the defence, a recurring theme in contemporary terrorism prosecutions. These include administrative hurdles within the Legal Aid Agency and the highly sensitive nature of some intercept material, necessitating redaction and recourse to closed material procedures pursuant to section 6 of the Justice and Security Act 2013. Defence counsel raised concerns at the February 2025 case management hearing about the impact of these delays on procedural fairness. However, the court has found that adequate steps were taken to ensure compliance with the defendant’s rights under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  

Reference should be made to the defendant’s antecedents with so-called Prevent referrals, which emerged during the preparation of the prosecution case. In late 2021, a lecturer at a local university raised concerns after the defendant submitted an academic essay with unusually detailed references to certain proscribed organisations and anarchist manifestos. A formal Prevent Channel panel was convened, involving education authorities and regional counter-extremism practitioners. Their assessments, while noting certain risk factors, concluded at the time that no further statutory action was warranted due to Mr H’s engagement with voluntary mentoring and apparently stable personal circumstances. The court records this, although it must be emphasised that such early-stage interventions are necessarily provisional and reflect assessments based on incomplete information.  

The procedural posture of the case has been complex. The defendant initially entered pleas of not guilty at the plea and trial preparation hearing held on 10 July 2025. However, on the morning of trial, after the evidential strengths of the Crown case had been fully marshalled, he elected to change his pleas to guilty on both counts. The court has received written and oral submissions from both prosecution and defence on the question of credit for this admission.  

It is regrettably frequent that defendants facing significant terrorism-related charges delay pleas until the point at which the prospect of acquittal appears untenable. Such conduct imposes substantial burdens on public resources, compounding the distress of victims or prospective victims and increasing the strain on judicial timetables. The jurisprudence on sentencing credit in such cases remains clear: credit is awarded for guilty pleas as an incentive to prompt acceptance of responsibility and to spare the court process. However, credit manifests as a discretionary reduction, not an automatic or presumptive entitlement. Late pleas, especially those entered after exhaustive disclosure and preparatory hearings, attract substantially reduced credit, reflecting the diminished procedural utility.  

The Court of Appeal cases cited by the Crown and solicited by the court include R v Mesher [2022] EWCA Crim 1467 and R v Bankole [2023] EWCA Crim 1399, both of which reiterate that the timing of pleas is of critical importance in sentencing assessments. In Bankole, the court emphasized the need for realism where pleas entered on the morning of trial follow prodigious investigative effort and comprehensive witness preparation. The principle articulated is that credit is a reflection of substantive mitigation, not mere tactical asset management.  

The court also reflects on the recent ruling in R v Patel [2024] EWCA Crim 814, concerning offences of possession with intent to supply Class A substances, where the defendant’s late change of plea was accorded limited discount. Though the offence category fundamentally differs, the conceptual underpinning of timely cooperation with the criminal process is relevant across offence classes, including terrorism.

The ideological trajectory evidenced in this case unfolded through a combination of online postings, encrypted forum contributions, and digital asset sharing. Mr H maintained a series of pseudonymous digital identities under which he promulgated commentary referencing a spectrum of increasingly radicalised narratives, such as grievance against perceived governmental overreach and calls for “direct action” couched in millenarian terms. The Crown’s linguistic analysts provided expert reports linking several of these communications to text found in extremist publications originating from proscribed groups under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The court places weight on this for establishing both intent and contextual culpability.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The forensic examination of the electronic devices recovered revealed multiple encrypted volumes containing instructional materials pertaining to improvised explosive devices (IEDs), incendiary devices, and so-called “booby-trap” setups. The defendant had acquired in his name components compatible with the manufacture of incendiary materials, as evidenced by purchase records and corroborated by witness testimony from staff at a hardware outlet located in the city centre; these purchases occurred during the late summer of 2024. The extent of this preparatory work represents a marked escalation warranting serious judicial attention.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Defence submissions sought to characterise certain acquisitions as related to the defendant’s avowed interest in pyrotechnics and amateur pyrotechnical displays, pointing to social media posts showcasing fireworks events. While such recreational hobbies warrant tolerance in a free society, the court is bound to consider the context, the intended purpose, and the chain of possession. The possession of dual-use precursors in combination with extremist digital material constitutes an aggravating factor within the sentencing framework.  

Miss Donnelly QC, appearing for the Crown, has drawn to the court’s attention the complexity and resource requirements of processing disclosure in terrorism cases, which often involve substantial volumes of data extending across multiple encrypted platforms and cloud storage providers. This complexity was borne out in the evidence-assessment logs prepared by CTPWM’s digital forensics unit, revealing over 4 terabytes of raw data processed and over 650 hours of analyst time expended.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The defendant made a number of foreign visits during the period of offence conduct, including a notable trip to Budapest in April 2024 ostensibly for architectural tourism. CCTV capture recorded interactions with an individual later charged in Germany with unregistered explosives possession. The defence posited coincidence and denied substantive interaction, but the quantity and quality of encrypted communication logs suggest otherwise. The Crown relies on evidence of digital contact persisting well beyond purported travel dates as indicative of ongoing collaboration and communication.  

The court notes in passing that the defendant’s name arose tangentially in relation to an unrelated enquiry involving co-defendants charged with aggravated burglary in the West Midlands region in 2023. However, there is no evidence Mr H participated in or was aware of that conduct, and indeed he has not been charged in relation to those offences. Such matters serve only to illustrate the intricacies and occasional entanglements of modern policing but are peripheral to the present sentencing exercise.  

The witness statements of victims and community representatives have been profoundly affected by the uncertainty and fear engendered by this prosecution. While no direct incidents of harm resulted from Mr H’s actions insofar as the charges were detected prior to actual deployment of any devices or plans, the foreseeable consequence of such conduct is widely acknowledged as catastrophic. The court acknowledges the impact of ongoing threat on community cohesion, social trust, and public vigilance, and commends the painstaking work of local victim support services which operate under difficult conditions.  

Responses from various voluntary organisations involved in the defendant’s area of residence, including the North Aston Neighbourhood Partnership and the Midlands Peace Foundation, were adduced for consideration by the court. Both reiterated their commitment to crisis de-escalation and community resilience but made no representations that would materially affect the sentencing calculus. Their continued engagement reflects the importance of sustained social infrastructure in mitigating radicalisation risks.  

The Actions for Mental Health Birmingham unit provided a report following psychological evaluation of the defendant. It noted symptoms of anxiety and moderate depressive episodes but did not identify any severe mental disorder capable of significantly impairing criminal responsibility. The psychological profile indicated a marked tendency towards cognitive rigidity and binary thinking typical of radicalised individuals. The report recommended structured risk management under community supervision, including cognitive behavioural therapy tailored toward radicalisation pathways.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial investigations uncovered a series of cryptocurrency transactions involving the defendant’s devices and associated wallets. Tracing through blockchain analytics revealed payments approximating £3,980 transferred to accounts associated with overseas vendors specialising in dual-use materials. Of note, a 0.75 Bitcoin transfer was traced through multiple mixing services designed to obfuscate origin and destination. Such measures underscored the defendant’s intent to conceal illicit procurement, further aggravating culpability.  

The pervasive rise of cryptocurrency as a weapon for concealment and funding in organised and ideological crime has become a growing concern for law enforcement and legislators alike. It will no doubt receive further scrutiny in future parliamentary inquiries and regulatory reform. Meanwhile, courts are confronted daily with these novel evidentiary and sentencing challenges.  

The court has reviewed surveillance logs documenting Mr H’s late-night presence at the Birmingham Canal area on 22 October 2024. Video was compiled from multiple municipal CCTV cameras supplemented by thermal imaging drone footage coordinated by the West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service for non-terrorism purposes unrelated to this investigation. The integration of these sources required extensive cross-referencing and collation to verify identity given the variable conditions. That such efforts are necessitated by the furtive behaviours of offenders places a considerable strain on limited law enforcement capacity.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to the defendant personally, Mr H is 31 years old, a graduate in software engineering from a Midlands university, and was formerly employed by a regional logistics company until his resignation in mid-2023. Character references from previous employers and acquaintances describe him as solitary, precise, and occasionally socially withdrawn, but make no mention of aggressive tendencies or prior criminality.  

Letters submitted on his behalf include correspondence from the Aston Writers’ Collective, praising his contributions to community poetry workshops. While ordinarily such civic engagement might weigh in mitigation, the court must balance these positive personal attributes against the weight of evidence establishing deliberate preparation to cause mass harm.  

The defendant’s engagement with voluntary deradicalisation initiatives, including contact with the West Midlands Prevent Team and the Birmingham Radicalisation Prevention Forum, has been sporadic and largely unimpactful. Submissions emphasised the challenges posed by the defendant’s guarded disposition and ideological intransigence. These agencies, despite resource constraints and political scrutiny, have continued to provide structured intervention offers, though compliance was limited.  

Psychiatric assessment by Dr Sanjay Banerjee of Birmingham Forensic Services provides a detailed clinical synopsis. He diagnoses a fixed extremist belief system but rules out Axis I psychiatric disorder, classifying Mr H’s risk as “high” for future ideologically motivated offending without significant and sustained intervention. The report underscores the challenges inherent in predicting human behaviour but affirms the need for comprehensive licence conditions and monitoring designed specifically for radicalised offenders.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

The offending conduct as presented is characterised by careful planning, digital sophistication, and an evident willingness to invest time and resources in preparation. Aggravating factors include the defendant’s technical knowledge, use of encryption and cryptocurrency to avoid detection, and the absence of genuine engagement with preventative initiatives. Mitigation is substantially limited to his lack of previous convictions, academic achievements, and the belated admissions of guilt. Credit for plea is restricted accordingly to a one-sixth discount.  

The Sentencing Council's Terrorism Guidelines (2023) provide the court with a structured framework for assessing culpability and risk of harm. These are complemented by statutory sentencing considerations set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and case law, including, but not limited to, R v Gul [2013] UKSC 64, R v Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, and R v Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678, all of which stress the primacy of deterrence, public safety, and proportionate containment in terrorism cases.  

The court directs the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report with special emphasis on the feasibility of an Extended Determinate Sentence where appropriate, together with recommendations for multi-agency risk management, inclusion of high-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy focusing on ideology and grievance, and the applicability of electronic monitoring and internet access restrictions post-release. To this end, the Probation Service is requested to consider coordination with approved premises in the West Midlands as well as ongoing liaison with the Ministry of Justice’s counter-extremism units.  

I record my thanks to Ms Eleanor Mays, who appears for the Crown, and to Mr Thomas Gale, instructed under a Legal Aid order on behalf of the defendant. The efforts of all engaged practitioners have facilitated adherence to the Criminal Procedure Rules. The sometimes slow administrative processing of funding authorisations, particularly with respect to expert instruction and disclosure review, underscores a pressing need for review within the Legal Aid framework to improve timely access to rights and services.  

This court also notes the continuing operational pressures on the West Midlands Forensic Psychiatric Unit stemming from long waiting lists, workforce shortages, and competing demands across the NHS, which have implications for the availability of timely psychological assessments in complex terrorism cases. The stretched nature of forensic services is a matter for government and public health authorities but tangibly affects justice processes.  

This sentencing hearing took place in the newly refurbished courtroom 5 at Birmingham Crown Court, a facility which has recently undergone significant investment to improve accessibility and audio-visual capacity, reflecting commitment to modernising the justice estate. Court administrative staff, ushers, and interpreters all performed efficiently and professionally throughout, ensuring the smooth conduct of proceedings.  

I reserve final sentence until receipt of the pre-sentence report, allowing time either party may require to make further written or oral submissions. The approach taken in sentencing will be communicated on the date fixed for that purpose. The defendant is reminded of his right of appeal once sentence is passed in accordance with statutory provisions.  

These are the orders of the court.
