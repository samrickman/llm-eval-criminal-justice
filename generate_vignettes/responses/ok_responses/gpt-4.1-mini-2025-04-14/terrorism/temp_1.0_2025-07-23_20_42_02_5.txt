IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/25839  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge M. J. THORNTON  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H appears before this Honourable Court for sentence upon conviction of two counts: conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006, and possession of an article for a purpose connected with terrorism, contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The period of offending conduct is alleged to cover from early 2023 until the defendant's arrest in March 2025.  

The court notes at the outset that the procedural history of this matter has been marked by protracted disclosure and listing challenges. The case was initially listed for trial in January 2025, but delays in securing full forensic examination of electronic devices and the intricacy of the legal issues surrounding closed material procedures necessitated multiple adjournments. These obstacles, although regrettable, reflect the complexity endemic in contemporary counter-terrorism prosecutions. Despite these hurdles, the parties have engaged professionally and diligently, for which the court expresses its gratitude.  

The defendant was taken into custody at 04:45 hours on 12 March 2025 pursuant to a warrant executed at a residential address in Erdington, Birmingham. The warrant was issued under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, supported by intelligence derived from an extended multi-agency operation involving Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, the National Cyber Crime Unit, and the Security Service. This operations synergy is, on balance, a testament to the emerging effectiveness of integrated threat response mechanisms, notwithstanding the acknowledged resource pressures faced nationally by enforcement agencies.

Prior to this arrest, Mr H had been subject to close surveillance and covert investigative techniques over a period exceeding eighteen months. Officers employed a range of data-gathering methods, including pattern-of-life analysis drawing on mobile phone location data, CCTV review, and sophisticated decryption efforts targeting encrypted communications platforms known for facilitating extremist exchanges. The sensitivity and scale of this operation have necessitated extensive judicial oversight with redaction protocols limiting disclosure to defence teams on a need-to-know basis.  

It merits mention that the Legal Aid Agency was engaged at an early stage to facilitate defence representation. However, difficulties arose concerning the approval process for instructing specialist digital forensic experts, resulting in some tactical disadvantage for the defence. The court notes with concern the persistence of such bureaucratic obstacles. Timely expert instruction is imperative in ensuring fairness, particularly in complex technological cases where interpretation of voluminous data sets requires unique skills and software.  

In reviewing the progression of the case, the court is conscious of the legislative context postdating the 2006 Act’s introduction. Notably, section 5 offences carry the gravest consequences short of active terrorist acts causing death or injury. The gravamen remains the preparatory acts which indicate a real risk of material harm, underscoring Parliament’s intent to pre-empt violence through lawful interdiction. Here, the prosecution bears the evidential burden to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that Mr H’s conduct transcended artistic or academic interest and that the articles possessed had an intended terrorist utility.  

The sentencing exercise is informed by the guidance of the Sentencing Council’s 2023 Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline. This guide directs the court’s assessment of culpability and harm, balancing aggravating and mitigating aspects within a structured framework. Worthy of reflection are the authoritative pronouncements of the Court of Appeal in cases such as R v. Al-Khatib [2021] EWCA Crim 1352, which emphasises the primacy of public protection and deterrence within the sentencing regime for terrorism-related convictions.

The court records that Mr H maintained an online presence—using the nom de plume “IronWarden”—where his postings evolved from benign commentary on regional politics to manifestos containing coded calls to ideological violence. Expert linguists produced evidence illustrating close correspondence between the defendant’s writings and materials distributed by proscribed entities, including the globally notable “Black Emissaries,” whose organisation was outlawed under Schedule 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000 in 2018. Such affiliations bolster the inference of deliberate planning rather than isolated thought experiments.

The electronic devices seized at the time of arrest contained substantial encrypted archives. A substantial portion of the data comprised manuals and schematics for the assembly of improvised explosive devices, alongside instructional videos assessing blast radius and lethality. One file, cryptically named “Serpent’s Coil,” contained graphical simulations of detonation patterns in urban settings. The sophistication of the digital material required a lengthy decryption and analysis process exceeding ten months, during which the defendant was remanded in custody. This delay, while regrettable, was indispensable to ensure accurate and reliable evidential presentation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Aside from his own devices, it was noted that Mr H had made repeated visits to an industrial estate in Solihull, ostensibly to “scout locations” for a community gardening project. The defence contended this was part of a rehabilitative endeavour, supported by volunteer records from the “Green Roots Initiative.” However, the court finds such explanations lacking in credibility when juxtaposed with the contemporaneous encrypted communications referencing explosives procurement.  

As an aside of procedural note, during pre-trial preparation, inquiries into co-defendants’ conduct revealed that one associate had ongoing proceedings for assault occasioning actual bodily harm following a late-night altercation in a Birmingham public house—a matter separate and distinct from the defendant's conduct and not relevant to the sentencing before this court.  

The court also encountered various administrative delays relating to interpreter services for a non-involved witness, adding further strain to a case already pressed against tight listing quotas in the Birmingham Crown Court.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Emerging from disclosure was evidence of Mr H’s travel to Antwerp in May 2024 under the pretext of attending a symposium on logistics and supply chain management. Travel records confirm connections made to known facilitators of extremist material distribution networks. CCTV from the port area identified Mr H in the company of individuals subsequently apprehended on unrelated offences of fly-tipping and possession of stolen copper cable—offences which do not in any way implicate the defendant but have been documented due to operational overlap between enforcement teams.  

The defence submitted character references from the “Birmingham Community Horticultural Society” and the “North End Foodbank,” each extolling Mr H’s participation in volunteer gardening projects and food distribution, respectively. While commendatory, it must be emphasised that such civic contributions—valuable as they are—cannot mitigate the gravity of prepatory conduct aimed at mass harm. Indeed, the juxtaposition of social virtue and malicious intent reveals a troubling paradox, rather than an excuse.  

On a related note, the landlord of Mr H’s residence was found to be subject to a noise abatement notice during 2024 following complaints by neighbours—again, wholly peripheral but noted during the preparation of pre-sentence material.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

The court heard forensic accounting evidence tracing a series of cryptocurrency transactions from digital wallets associated directly with Mr H. These payments included transfers totalling approximately £3,100 to vendors specialising in chemical precursors and high-strength detonators. The transactions employed mixing services designed to obscure the transactional history, reflecting an understanding of financial anonymity techniques. While cryptocurrencies hold legitimate commercial applications, their use in facilitating terrorism offences poses acute challenges to detection and prosecution, as highlighted in recent Parliamentary briefings.  

From a law enforcement capacity standpoint, it is worth acknowledging the strenuous demands placed on digital forensics units, who operate under chronic staffing shortages and with software platforms rapidly outpaced by adversarial encryption methods. The scale of resource required to untangle Mr H’s digital footprint involved over 400 person-hours by specialized analysts, underscoring the asymmetrical nature of such investigations.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Addressing personal circumstances, Mr H is 31 years of age, educated to postgraduate level in computer science. His previous employment as a systems analyst in a financial technology firm is documented. A supervisor’s character statement describes him as “intelligent, meticulous, technically gifted but socially reserved.” He resigned abruptly in July 2023 following concerns raised about his access to and use of company data, which had prompted an internal disciplinary inquiry unrelated to the present charges.  

Recent engagement with mental health services was recorded. A psychiatric report dated 10 August 2025, produced by Dr Laura Benton, consultant forensic psychiatrist, diagnoses Mr H as exhibiting traits consistent with autistic spectrum condition, with notable cognitive inflexibility. Importantly, no formal diagnosis of psychosis or major depressive disorder was recorded. Dr Benton assesses the defendant as posing a high risk of violent radicalisation if unsupervised post-release, cautioning that ideological fixations are resistant to change absent intensive intervention.  

Certainly, the probation officer assigned to Mr H’s case has remarked on his cooperative demeanour during interviews and has encouraged enrolment in the local “Cognitive Behavioural Deradicalisation Programme.” Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether engagement will endure beyond custodial settings, given patterns of prior disengagement from community programmes.  

Moreover, the court notes that Mr H has a younger sibling currently subject to independent criminal proceedings for benefit fraud in a different jurisdiction. While this circumstance has no bearing on the defendant’s culpability or risk, it has been brought to the court’s attention in the submissions from interested parties.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

In concluding remarks, the court observes that the seriousness of the offences before it cannot be overstated. The defendant’s engagement in preparatory acts was methodical, sustained, and accompanied by a marked proficiency in technical and digital domains. The offensive material recovered and the capability demonstrated place him in the highest category of culpability as identified by the Sentencing Council’s guidelines. Aggravating factors include the intended indiscriminate nature of the threat, the investigative resources diverted, and the clear preparedness to resort to violence for ideological ends.  

Mitigation is minimal, comprising primarily a lack of previous convictions and the partial admission of guilt at a late stage in proceedings, for which limited credit can be afforded. The defendant’s intellectual capacities and some positive community involvement are acknowledged but cannot materially diminish the overriding public protection interests.  

The court directs that a comprehensive pre-sentence report be prepared, with particular focus on assessing the feasibility of a lengthy custodial sentence coupled with multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) oversight at Category 3 level. Interventions to manage extremist risk, including specialist psychological input and electronic monitoring conditions, should be explored. The report should also consider the likely responsiveness of Mr H to desistance strategies and the resources necessary to mitigate ongoing risk to the public.  

Expressions of appreciation are due to the dedicated operatives and analysts of Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands, the National Forensic Digital Institute, and the Birmingham Community Mental Health Team, whose sustained efforts have made the effective prosecution of this complex matter possible despite pressures of capacity and pandemic-related staffing disruptions. The court also gratefully acknowledges the professionalism of counsel on both sides; Ms Samantha Firth for the Crown and Mr Daniel Graves for the defence, whose submissions were thorough and measured.  

Today’s sentencing hearing has proceeded without interruption in Court 5 of the Birmingham Crown Court. The court is satisfied that all necessary procedural safeguards have been observed, including accessible facilities for the defendant and appropriate accommodations for his neurodevelopmental needs.  

The court will now adjourn to allow for the preparation of the pre-sentence report. Sentencing will take place on 16 December 2025, when the court will be assisted by any additional representations or reports it deems relevant.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. Proceedings have been transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the National Offender Management Service.  

These are the orders of the court.
