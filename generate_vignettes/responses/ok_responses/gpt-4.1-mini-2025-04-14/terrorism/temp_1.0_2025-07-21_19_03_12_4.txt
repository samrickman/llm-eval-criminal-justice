IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. B2025/32794  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. J. NORTON  
Filed: 3 October 2025  

Mr H stands before this court to be sentenced following his conviction on two counts: one, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; and two, possession of an article for purposes connected with the commission of terrorism contrary to section 57 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The offending conduct, as found by the jury, occurred between September 2023 and Mr H’s arrest in January 2025.  

The defendant was initially apprehended at 07:45 on 10 January 2025, following the execution of search warrants at his residence in Bedminster by officers of Counter Terrorism Policing South West (CTPSW). These searches were supported by material obtained under section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, pursuant to which surveillance and interception data indicated significant encrypted communications linked to foreign-hosted extremist forums. The seizure included multiple encrypted devices, storage media, and improvised electronic components.

The investigation, codenamed Operation STAGHORN, involved extensive coordination among various agencies, including the National Crime Agency’s Digital Forensics Unit and elements of the Royal Mail Investigation Service, which monitored suspected procurement of materials via parcel freight from abroad. The protracted nature of the investigation led to an initial detention period extended under the provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000, with repeated reviews by the magistrates’ court pursuant to paragraph 7B of schedule 8.  

The court notes with concern the procedural delay attributed, at least in part, to the difficulty securing disclosure of intercept evidence cleared for Crown use, impeding early preparation of the defence. The Legal Aid Agency’s invitation for a detailed forensic expert report was authorised only after a protracted negotiation spanning four weeks, imposing constraints on the defence team led by Mr Callum Fisher QC. Such delays are regrettable but reflective of systemic bottlenecks routinely encountered in terrorism prosecutions. Indeed, prolonged processing times are not peculiar to this jurisdiction; similar challenges have been noted in R v Hurley [2023] EWCA Crim 732 and R v Worthington [2024] EWCA Crim 911.  

It should also be recorded that Mr H was referred to the statutory Prevent programme on two separate occasions prior to the offending conduct coming to light. The first referral dates to October 2021, initiated by an academic pastoral officer who noted troubling social media posts bannered with extremist iconography. The Channel Panel considered the referral but discontinued it for lack of engagement by Mr H. A further referral in June 2022 by a community youth worker involved renewed efforts at engagement, to similar effect. The demise of these interventions poses questions about the adequacy of early deradicalisation frameworks, but this court must confine itself to adjudication on the evidence before it, rather than the wider policy efficacy of counter-extremism measures.  

The matter was listed for plea and trial preparation on 15 June 2025. Mr H initially entered not guilty pleas on all counts. He only tendered guilty pleas on the morning of 18 September 2025 following the close of the prosecution case and after judges had ruled on numerous contested applications, including the admissibility of evidence obtained through intercepted communications. The court recognises this late change of plea but notes the limiting factor it imposes on credit to be awarded, as articulated in R v. Hepburn [2022] EWCA Crim 1445 and R v. Melhuish [2024] EWCA Crim 1181.  

The Court of Appeal has repeatedly emphasised that credit for guilty plea is not a mere procedural formality, but a recognition of genuine remorse and voluntary acceptance of culpability at the earliest opportunity consistent with rational legal advice. The delay evidenced in this case suggests tactical calculation rather than contrition, warranted by the substantial mobilization of prosecutorial and judicial resources. The phenomenon of last-minute pleas—commonplace though it may be—is no less regrettable, and the court must keep in mind the effect on victims and the public interest in efficient criminal justice.  

Historical context regarding the statutory framework is pertinent. The Terrorism Act 2006 created a legal edifice for the prosecution of preparatory conduct, recognising the latent threat posed by acts not yet consummated but clearly aimed at disruption, intimidation, or harm to wider populations. Section 5(1)(a) criminalises conduct undertaken “in preparation” for terrorism, capturing a spectrum from reconnaissance to acquisition of materials—and indeed, the law recognises the gravity of such acts even if the ultimate event does not transpire. The authoritative commentary in R v. Nazir [2017] UKSC 52 outlines the necessary mens rea and the distinction between wholly preparatory acts and mere association or abstract advocacy. That judgment, while not directly on point, underscores the threshold for intervention in contexts of radicalised intent.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

The defendant maintained an online presence using the moniker “IronWarden,” which exhibited a progressive radical shift in content over an eighteen-month period. Early posts focussed on political dissatisfaction and grievances related to socioeconomic disparities; however, by mid-2024, these posts routinely featured radical rhetoric consistent with proscribed ideologies, referencing texts banned under the Terrorism Act 2000, schedule 2. Forensic linguists provided expert analysis comparing phraseology with that found in verified extremist propaganda. The court finds this evidentiary chain compelling in establishing ideological alignment and intent.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Digital forensic examination uncovered encrypted VeraCrypt volumes containing technical manuals on explosive material synthesis, bomb-making diagrams, and instructional videos on improvised incendiary devices. Interestingly, defence submissions drew attention to amateur drone piloting videos in adjacent file clusters, posited as possibly innocuous recreational footage. While such content is commonplace, the court is satisfied that juxtaposition with explicit bomb-making materials negates any benign reading.  

The recovery of a partially used notebook containing handwritten calculations related to explosive fragmentation radii further substantiates preparatory intent. Defence experts questioned the procedural reliability of forensic imaging owing to alleged contamination during seizure, arguments which were duly considered and rejected by this court’s prior rulings.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

The court is not unaware of the presence of minor household paraphernalia, including a small quantity of cannabis recovered at the scene. While this may be indicative of commonplace youthful behaviour, it is legally and morally immaterial to the terrorism offences. It is noted here solely because it was advanced by the defence to portray Mr H as an isolated but non-threatening individual. Such mitigation cannot offset the gravity of his planning and procuring conduct.  

The court also notes for completeness that Mr H received a fixed penalty notice in 2018 for possession of a bladed article in a retail park car park, an offence unrelated to the present charges and without further historical recurrence. This circumstance illuminates a sporadic record of minor offences, but does not bear materially on the present assessment of risk or culpability.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Further complexities arise from Mr H’s foreign travel history. Airline manifests show a visit to Minsk in April 2024 described as a “business conference,” though intercepted communications suggest meetings with individuals linked to transnational extremist cells. Notably, CCTV footage captured Mr H boarding a bus to the city outskirts, a locale known as a hotspot for illicit arms trading and extremist gatherings, prior to his return to the UK a day later. The court gives due weight to these circumstantial indicia as part of the pattern of activity preceding his arrest.  

It is regrettable that disclosure and vetting requirements severely lengthened the timetable of this prosecution. The Crown’s evidentiary bundles totaled in excess of 1,200 items, including audio-visual intercepts, digital chat logs, and expert reports. The volume imposed significant burdens on defendants’ representatives, the judiciary, and court staff, highlighting systemic strains across the criminal justice infrastructure.  

The Legal Aid Agency’s role deserves particular scrutiny. The authorised defence budget for expert review of electronic evidence was capped at 120 hours, constraining the commissioning of supplementary cyber-experts. This mirrors the chronic underfunding challenges noted by the Criminal Bar Association and the Justice Select Committee. While no blame attaches to the practitioners involved, these circumstances inevitably raise concerns about equitable access to full procedural fairness.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Financial investigation uncovered cryptocurrency transactions amounting to £3,900 traded through multiple tumbling services. The wallet addresses, linked by metadata to Mr H’s known aliases, routed payments to vendors of dual-use chemical precursors. Whilst cryptocurrency offers legitimate opportunities for financial privacy, in this case it functioned as a vehicle for obfuscating illicit procurement consistent with the allegations. Courts must therefore regard such financial behaviour as an aggravating feature, indicating sophistication and premeditation.  

The court took note of observations provided by officers of the Environmental Crimes Unit regarding nearby fly-tipping incidents of industrial solvents in protected green belt land, an offence entirely unconnected to Mr H but arising in the course of ancillary inquiries into local criminality. This is noted for completeness, with no bearing on the current sentencing.  

A covert surveillance operation recorded a brief nocturnal visit by Mr H to the Avon River embankment, where he stayed approximately eight minutes. Such surveillance demands enormous resource allocation: analysts expended over 150 hours due to low visibility, scattered camera angles, and signal interference. While the court recognises this as emblematic of the asymmetry between criminal activity and investigative effort, it does not weigh heavily into sentence.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

The defendant is 28 years old, holding a degree in electrical engineering. He was formerly employed for two years at a regional telecommunications provider but resigned abruptly in early 2023 following inquiries into unauthorized access to restricted data. Letters provided by former employers and community organisations indicate a person capable of focused work and some civic involvement, including coaching a youth football team in Bedminster and volunteering with a community food bank. These positive traits must be weighed against the harms occasioned by his offending.  

It is noted that a probation officer involved in the defendant’s initial risk assessment was subsequently arrested on unrelated charges of professional misconduct. The court draws no adverse inference from that fact, but it illustrates the complexities and vulnerabilities inherent in managing high-risk individuals amidst institutional challenges.  

The defendant’s mental health was assessed by Dr Fiona Caldwell, consultant forensic psychiatrist, whose report identifies no formal diagnosis but describes Mr H as exhibiting “fixed beliefs consistent with ideological rigidity and social isolation.” Dr Caldwell opines that the defendant poses a high risk of future extremist violence absent intensive intervention. The report advocates for consideration of Intensive Supervision and Monitoring (ISM) plus engagement on the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). However, the court is mindful of the statistics indicating widely variable compliance rates among this cohort.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Sentencing must be undertaken in accordance with the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences guidelines (2023), which underscore public protection, deterrence, denunciation, and rehabilitation as cornerstones of appropriate punishment. The aggravating factors here include deliberate and sustained planning, use of encrypted communications, acquisition of potentially destructive materials, and attempts to evade detection through complex financial transactions. These elevate this case to the higher culpability strata.  

Mitigation is limited to the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, educational attainment, redeployment potential, and late plea. The latter attracts a credit reduction of no more than one-sixth, consistent with prevailing authority. The court is conscious of the delicate balance required when dealing with ideological offenders: sentences must be sufficiently severe to protect public safety and to degrade extremist networks, while not foreclosing paths to rehabilitation where feasible.  

Prior to determining sentence, a full pre-sentence report is directed. The authors are instructed to consider not only the standard factors of risk and need but also the suitability of extended custodial provisions under section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, particularly the feasibility of a sentence incorporating lengthy license conditions including GPS tracking, internet access restrictions, and mandatory attendance at approved disengagement programmes. Probation services should also assess the availability of placement within Approved Premises with specialist resource capacity to supervise terrorism risk offenders.  

The court records its appreciation for the detailed reports submitted by the West Country Integrated Counter-Terrorism Unit, the community rehabilitation company, and the healthcare professionals involved in the defendant’s assessment. It also acknowledges the contextual challenges faced by the East Bristol Prevent Team, whose efforts prior to arrest, while ultimately unsuccessful, were none the less measured and professionally conducted.  

Mr H is reminded of his statutory right to appeal both conviction and sentence within 28 days, as provided by the provisions of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, nor any application was made to that effect.  

These remarks are pronounced on this day, 3 October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal order of conviction and sentence will be dispatched to the Criminal Records Office and appropriate supervisory authorities.  

These are the orders of the court.
