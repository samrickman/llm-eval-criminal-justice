IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. MR H  
Case No. 2025/14862  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. Ravenscroft  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentencing in connection with a representative offence of shoplifting, brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending is of a protracted nature, covering multiple incidents across various retail premises located principally in the East Birmingham and Solihull areas. The events date from late 2023 through to April 2025 and represent a course of conduct distinguished by its persistence and clear planning. 

Procedural History  
Your matter was first listed for a plea hearing on 12 May 2025, following your arrest on 28 April 2025. The arrest arose after an intensive, inter-agency investigation coordinated between the West Midlands Police Commercial Crime Unit, the Birmingham Retail Crime Alliance, and the regional intelligence section of the Midland Forensics Service. I note, with some satisfaction, the relative promptness by which this case progressed to the Crown Court, which is not always guaranteed in offences of this character given the competing demands on judicial and prosecutorial resources. 

There was a prior mention on 30 June 2025, which was adjourned at the request of the defence to enable completion of a psychiatric assessment and further disclosure requests. The period between arrest and remand attendance saw repeated liaison with the Legal Aid Agency, with the court receiving periodic updates on the progress of the defence applications for funding to instruct independent psychological expertise. This matter highlights the ongoing operational challenges facing representation bodies, whose resourcing difficulties have been the subject of recent parliamentary scrutiny and judicial commentary. Delays of three months or more for the approval of urgent funding in cases involving potential mental health concerns remain regrettably common, diminishing the prospects of timely justice.

I record my thanks to Ms Chloe Middleton, instructed on behalf of the Crown, and to Mr Andrew Forster who represents you on a full representation order. Both counsel have conducted their responsibilities with commendable professionalism and have timely filed all necessary documentation. The court notes that, notwithstanding substantial operational pressures—such as temporary understaffing in the local prosecution team and the delayed arrival of some court clerks—the procedural timetable has been upheld within acceptable margins.

At a pre-trial review hearing on 21 July 2025, following the receipt of the psychiatric report prepared by Dr Naomi Stratton—consultant forensic psychologist—the defence entered a late plea of guilty. This timing, whilst beneficial for the efficient disposal of the matter, limits the extent of credit that can be accorded given the prolonged pre-trial denial. It is well settled that the sentencing regime recognises the saving of court time and the sparing of victims and witnesses the ordeal of trial, but the benefit is weighted by the timing and sincerity of the plea, as observed in R v. Kendal [2019] EWCA Crim 2267 and reiterated recently in R v. Gupta [2024] EWCA Crim 55.

The court is mindful of the burden placed on policing resources, which in this case included a sustained surveillance operation over a period of six weeks in early 2025. Officers utilised a combination of covert observation, undercover officers, and proactive store liaison, culminating in coordinated arrests following the capture of suspect behaviour on store CCTV. As noted in the case of R v Wilkes [2020] EWCA Crim 1032, the cumulative drain on public funds occasioned by repeat offending cannot be ignored, even where the individual value of stolen goods is not substantial.

It is reported that the investigation involved deployment of a specially trained team of retail crime analysts, whose function includes the synthesis of cross-sector intelligence to identify and disrupt patterns of offending. Despite such proactive measures, the demand placed on front line staff remains considerable. The theft of stock—often essential items such as over-the-counter medication and hygiene products—has a ripple effect on enterprise viability and consumer confidence at the community level.

It bears emphasis that the court is not tasked with issuing social commentary but acknowledges that the context within which such offences take place is shaped by wider systemic issues. Indeed, the proliferation of low-level acquisitive offending has been discussed in parliamentary reports dating back over the last decade (see, for example, the Home Office Review of Retail Crime 2018), reflecting a persistent challenge in balancing public protection, resource allocation, and offender rehabilitation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

Several submissions have been made on your behalf, including correspondence from the local support charity Birmingham Aid and Resilience Network, which has provided assistance in relation to your housing and financial difficulties over the past eighteen months. Their letter attests to your intermittent engagement with support services, though also noting some missed appointments and limited participation in planned financial literacy workshops. It is a sobering reflection of the strain under which voluntary sector organisations operate that such services are often dependent on uncertain funding and perpetually stretched staff.

A letter from your sister, Mrs. Karen Hale, was also submitted. It outlines a history of familial instability and disrupted schooling in your teenage years. While such testimony is heartfelt, the court is under a duty to assess it within the broader framework of offender autonomy and responsibility.

I note further the report prepared by Probation Officer Simon Carver dated 7 September 2025. This document provides a comprehensive overview of your background, including prior convictions for dishonesty offences and your current licence conditions. The probation service highlights concerns regarding your failure to fully engage with prior community orders, including unpaid work and attendance at rehabilitation workshops. This recalcitrance, combined with the absence of any meaningful employment or training, flags an ongoing risk of reoffending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

It is necessary, at this juncture, to remind the court of the applicable sentencing framework governing offences of this nature. The Theft Act 1968 and attendant Sentencing Council guidelines direct that the gravity of the offence, its context, and the culpability of the offender be balanced carefully against any mitigating factors. The repetitive nature of conduct, incurrence of victim harm (even if non-physical), and any history of previous offending will weigh in aggravation.

Reference may be made to previous appellate rulings, including R v. Chamberlain [2022] EWCA Crim 1785, which dealt with persistent shop theft and confirmed that sentences proportionate to the cumulative impact of behaviours are appropriate even when individual items involved are of low value. Similarly, R v. Ferguson [2023] EWCA Crim 1265 reaffirmed the principle that the protection of vulnerable community businesses may justify enhanced sentences where there is evidence of deliberate targeting.

The court also considers the provision of sentencing discounts for guilty pleas as set out in the Sentencing Council’s guideline “Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea” (2020). It cautions that credit must be commensurate with the timing and candor of the plea, and that last-minute pleas do not carry the same benefit as those entered at the first opportunity. The late plea in this case leaves limited room for mitigation on that basis.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

This case was also subject to an application for a deferred sentence to allow for the compilation of a detailed pre-sentence report, which the court granted on 15 August 2025. This prerogative was exercised to provide a fuller assessment of your rehabilitative needs and risk profile, mindful of the complex interplay between socio-economic factors and offending behaviour.

Of note is the psychiatric evaluation by Dr Stratton, whose report concludes that you display features consistent with a mild depressive disorder and episodic substance misuse, but no diagnosable severe mental illness. She emphasises a pattern of poor impulse control and a tendency toward self-medication with alcohol, which has historically exacerbated your involvement in theft. While acknowledging these matters as contributory, the report stops short of recommending custodial exemption, highlighting the importance of a structured rehabilitation programme combined with community supervision.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

The report situates your offending within a broader context of social and financial instability—factors which the court must weigh but which do not excuse intentional and repeated criminal conduct. The balance to be struck involves protecting the public, deterring future offending, and affording the defendant a realistic prospect of rehabilitation with appropriate intervention.

The court is acutely aware of the acute shortage of probation officers available nationally, which impedes the delivery of tailored offender management. Reports such as this one are increasingly rare in their detail due to systemic pressures. This is regrettable but highlights the need for courts to take seriously all evidence relating to risks and needs.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Turning to the impact upon victims, I have reviewed statements submitted by retail managers and staff across multiple affected premises. These statements uniformly describe the deleterious effects of persistent theft on staff morale, operational efficiency, and financial stability. One letter from a local convenience store manager notes that repeated theft of analgesics and cold remedies forced the reduction of stock, leaving genuine customers without access and eroding community trust.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

In another example, a pharmacy located in a deprived area reported the decision to reduce opening hours and install additional security measures, all costed in tens of thousands of pounds, expenses ultimately borne indirectly by consumers and taxpayers. Such indirect harms, though intangible, are real and relevant in the sentencing calculus.

I note with regret that this case required the involvement of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership, which, while generally effective, operates under considerable strain given the sheer number of retail crime incidents across the West Midlands. Their involvement typically entails data collation, offender profiling, and liaison with police and local authority teams. The Bureau of Retail Security Reports for 2024 indicates an overall increase in shoplifting incidents despite these efforts, suggesting that such cases are symptomatic of broader social challenges.

It is appropriate also to reflect on comparable case law even where direct parallels are absent. Consider the decision in R v. Hargreaves [2017] EWCA Crim 1400, where the Court underscored the need for sentences in acquisitive crime to signal societal condemnation. Though that case involved aggravated burglary with no injury, its underlying principles about the cumulative effect of repeated intrusions upon victims resonate with cases of shoplifting conducted as a course of conduct.

The court acknowledges the letter from your sister dated 2 September 2025. While it provides a degree of personal character evidence, including reference to your cooperation with support services and expressions of remorse, such statements do not supplant the necessity to impose a sentence reflecting both punishment and public protection.

I am conscious that housing instability played a role in your recent life narrative. The correspondence from Birmingham Housing Options confirms an extended period of temporary accommodation pending permanent placement. That the pressures on local housing authorities are acute goes without saying. The national crisis in affordable housing availability is well documented and has spawned repeated Parliamentary inquiries. Nonetheless, the justice system is not equipped to serve as a primary arbiter of social welfare entitlements, and the law is clear that need for accommodation does not confer immunity from prosecution or sentencing.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

The relevant statutory provisions, the Theft Act 1968 and the Sentencing Council guideline, inform this court’s obligation to impose punishment appropriate to the seriousness of dishonesty and its adverse impact, while offering opportunities for rehabilitation that are proportionate to risk and feasible within existing public resources.

Final Considerations and Next Steps  
In light of all the material before the court—the factual matrix, the reports from probation and psychological assessment, the victim impact statements, and the submissions by counsel—I am satisfied that the offending conduct is serious and deliberate, warranting a custodial sentence unless exceptional mitigating factors emerge.

The late plea reduces the extent of any mitigation. Your pattern of prior convictions further amplifies concerns regarding recidivism. The probation report suggests limited engagement with prior non-custodial orders, heightening the necessity of a sentence that will provide both punishment and deterrence.

I must stress, however, that the sentencing regime remains committed to consideration of community-based disposals where appropriate and viable. The forthcoming pre-sentence report should further elucidate the possibility of such interventions, including the suitability for attendance on targeted cognitive behavioural programmes addressing acquisitive offending and impulse control, alongside substance misuse treatment where warranted.

The court also invites the probation service to consider the facility, where available, of a Conditional Rehabilitation Order incorporating unpaid work elements and tailored supervision. I emphasise that this is not a foregone conclusion, and the final sentence will take full account of the pre-sentence report and any additional representations.

The court notes the absence of any additional notifiable restrictions, and that no persons under eighteen were directly involved or endangered in this matter. There is no evidence of any linkage with organised crime or further complicity beyond your conduct.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 4 at Birmingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A formal judgement and sentence will follow after consideration of the full pre-sentence report. You are reminded of your statutory right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs will be reserved pending the outcome of sentencing.

These are the orders of the court.
