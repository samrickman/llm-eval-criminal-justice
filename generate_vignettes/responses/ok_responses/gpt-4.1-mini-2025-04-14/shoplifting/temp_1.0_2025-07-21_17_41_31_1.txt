IN THE CROWN COURT AT EASTBROOK  
R v. MR H  
Case No. E2025/12547  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. Cartwright  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct as charged concerns a pattern of behaviour observed over a protracted period across a number of retail premises within the Eastbrook and surrounding boroughs. This court has before it detailed evidence and submissions pertaining to those matters.

Procedural History  
The matter came before Eastbrook Magistrates’ Court on 26 April 2025, where initial pleas were entered, and the case was committed to the Crown Court in accordance with the established protocols for cases involving multiple counts and the potential for custodial sentencing. It is relevant to note that the custody threshold was engaged due to the repetition and circumstances of the offences alleged. At magistrates, bail conditions were imposed; these required your residence at a fixed address and a prohibition on entering specified retail premises, measures aligned with the public interest in preventing further offending pending trial.

As is frequently encountered in cases of this nature, the investigative process was marked by coordination between several agencies, including the Eastbrook Business Crime Partnership, local policing units, and licensing authorities. The case was subject to the Better Case Management initiative, which seeks to encourage early case resolution and streamline pre-trial procedures. The plea and trial preparation hearing was listed for 15 July 2025 but was adjourned to 12 August due to a late application by the defence to instruct a psychiatric expert, a request which the Legal Aid Agency initially delayed processing until urgency was established by the court. The challenges encountered in securing such funding raise important systemic issues regarding timely access to expert evidence, which the court records with regret.

During the hearing of 12 August, you entered a plea of not guilty, asserting various defences, including mistaken identity and challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. This necessitated the setting of a trial date. However, on 5 September 2025, immediately before the trial commenced, you changed your plea to guilty. The court notes this last-minute change and the implications it bears on credit for plea in sentencing.

The court’s experience with similar cases acknowledges that late pleas, while entirely permissible and within the rights of defendants, impose significant burdens on the court process and the witnesses who attend, often necessitating extensive preparation for what ultimately becomes unnecessary contested proceedings. The jurisprudence on credit for guilty pleas, including the important guidance established in R v. Jakobsen [2018] EWCA Crim 159, clearly articulates the parameters within which such credit may be responsibly granted.

This court is also mindful of the observations in R v. Tisdale [2019] EWCA Crim 320, where the appellate court underscored the link between the timing of a plea and the degree of discount applicable, emphasising the importance of genuine acceptance of responsibility over tactical decision-making prompted merely by evidential weight. The principle remains sound and is applied here with careful attention to the circumstances of the plea.

The court is grateful for the representations made by counsel on both sides. Ms Felicity Drake, for the Crown, presented a carefully constructed submission as to the aggravating impact of persistent acquisitive behaviour on retail business morale and security staffing. Mr Oliver Trent, on your behalf, set out mitigating factors pertaining to your personal circumstances, including housing instability and reported challenges with substance misuse, while also candidly acknowledging the late nature of the plea.

It is appropriate, before proceeding further, to register the court’s appreciation for the input of the Eastbrook Retail Victim Support Scheme, whose detailed impact statements have provided valuable insights not merely into immediate financial loss but into the broader psychological effect on retail employees. Their evidence aligns with the modern understanding, supported by criminological research, that the trauma induced in such contexts can be significant, notwithstanding the absence of physical harm.

The evidence base further benefits from the psychiatric report authored by Dr Elaine Morley, a consultant forensic psychiatrist engaged to assess your mental state and risk profile. Her report is comprehensive, weighing historical and contemporaneous clinical records alongside your own account. While no major diagnosis of psychotic or mood disorder was made, significant findings in relation to impulse control, emotional dysregulation, and features of dependent personality traits were identified. Dr Morley also noted indications of long-standing polysubstance use, which, while not meeting diagnostic thresholds for dependence, nevertheless materially impairs judgement and increases vulnerability to relapse.

The court is aware that shoplifting disproportionately affects small and independent retailers, for whom even minor losses can be existential threats. This impact transcends mere fiscal measures, encompassing the costs of increased security, staff turnover, and the erosion of community confidence. A recent annual report by the Retail Crime Analysis Group (RCAG), though principally focusing on metropolitan centres, highlighted that repeat offenders are responsible for a disproportionate fraction of shrinkage across retail sectors — particularly in pharmacies and convenience stores.

It must also be recognised that the legal framework governing sentencing in theft cases directs courts not solely to focus on the monetary value involved but also on the offender’s culpability and the degree of planning and premeditation. Section 142 of the Sentencing Act 2020, while not yet fully tested in appellate courts, provides statutory reinforcement for penalising recidivist conduct aggressively.

The court is not unmindful of the strain placed on probation services in the current fiscal environment. Reports from the Ministry of Justice indicate a persistent shortfall in available qualified practitioners, leading to caseloads well above recommended limits. This systemic pressure inevitably circumscribes the scope and frequency of contact with service users, potentially impairing rehabilitative effectiveness. Such realities, while extrinsic to individual culpability, frame the context in which sentencing and post-sentence supervision occur.

It should also be noted that the Legal Aid Agency’s processing of applications for psychological assessments and representations remains inconsistent. Delayed authorisations in this case reflect a regrettable pattern, as highlighted in the regional review of funding mechanisms for criminal defence work published in March 2025, which called for urgent reforms to prevent undermining defendant rights and case progression.

The court further notes the relevance of domestic violence statutes, strictly speaking unencompassing this case, yet illustrative through comparators in terms of harm and sentencing principles, as found in R v. Calder [2022] EWCA Crim 1287. Although the cases differ markedly in facts and culpability, the judiciary’s approach to recognising patterns of behaviour and escalating consequences remains consistent.

Turning to the substance of the case, the facts as established by the Crown and accepted in your plea are as follows. 

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

The items stolen, while individually of modest value, represent collectively a significant economic loss to the shops involved. Moreover, the manner in which the thefts were conducted betrays a calculated approach. Evidence includes the use of bags reportedly modified to defeat detection systems, the timing of thefts to coincide with staff breaks or low-visibility periods, and the alleged use of distraction techniques upon store employees.

17 August 2025 saw the production of victim impact statements, not only from the proprietors of affected stores but also from employees, one of whom described fluctuating anxiety levels and altered work patterns in response to your repeated presence, including requests to avoid lone working on shifts. The psychological ramifications for low-wage workers in such circumstances are well-documented and impose a further dimension of harm.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

This was not mere opportunism. The pattern demonstrated points to sophisticated offending. The court must consider that, contrary to some offenders who commit momentary lapses, you exhibited persistence despite prior warnings, previous community resolutions, and informal interventions by police liaison officers.

It is helpful at this juncture to reflect on the jurisprudence concerning theft by shoplifting involving repeated offending. The unreported case of R v. Denning [2019] EWCA Crim 764 is instructive, where the Court upheld a sentence of 18 months for a defendant who engaged in a similar modus operandi, involving multiple thefts from pharmacy chains whilst evading detection through the use of disguises and accomplices. Although it is acknowledged that the evidence here does not establish co-conspirators, the calculated nature of the offending calls for an appropriately robust response.

In relation to public safety and risk, the psychiatric assessment suggests that you do not pose a risk of serious physical harm to others. However, the report highlights elevated risks of reoffending tied to the underlying impulsivity and substance misuse issues. The Probation Service has confirmed that historically, engagement with supervisory programmes has been sporadic.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Careful consideration must also be given to the representation offered on your behalf as to mitigating circumstances. The letters of support submitted by family members and voluntary agencies indicate that you suffer from housing insecurity, with residence shifting between temporary accommodation and family homes. The challenges posed by this instability are acknowledged by the court as legitimate factors impacting behaviour and wellbeing. However, the balance to be struck between understanding and accountability necessarily prioritises prevention of criminal conduct and protection of the public interest.

The court recognises the efforts of the Eastbrook Housing Support Service, which has sought to engage with you regarding sustainable tenancy and budgeting advice. Nevertheless, such support remains conditional upon your continued participation, which has been inconsistent to date. It cannot be doubted that the system faces considerable demand. As noted in the Housing and Homelessness Annual Review 2024, the scarcity of affordable housing places acute pressures on vulnerable residents, leading, as often as not, to health deterioration, social dislocation, and, regrettably, risks of offending.

Similar pressures have been illuminated within substance misuse frameworks. The Eastbrook Recovery Partnership has reported an increased caseload with waiting periods averaging six months for targeted community-based interventions. Early engagement is critical, and this court hopes that any custodial term imposed will be accompanied by access to such services to reduce the risk of reoffending.

From the standpoint of sentencing guidelines, the overarching principles guiding theft offences remain: the culpability of the offender, the harm caused, and the impact on victims and community confidence. The Sentencing Council’s Theft Definitive Guideline, last updated in 2024, emphasises that persistent offending with deliberate planning is an aggravating feature warranting custodial sentences in accordance with the offender’s antecedent record and the offence category.

Notably, community resolutions previously arranged in your case failed to deter repeated offending. This fact weighs heavily in delivering a message both to yourself and to the wider public that sustained criminal conduct cannot be overlooked or treated indulgingly.

The court is conscious, too, of the wider societal picture. Eastbrook has experienced an increase in acquisitive crime in the last financial year, pressurising the policing and judicial resources available. Such cases constitute a significant portion of court workloads and are often cited by local businesses as deterrents to investment and economic stability. The Business Crime Reduction Partnership here, while proactive, operates in an environment of scarce funding and outreach limitations.

The relationship between acquisitive crime and social deprivation is intricate but not deterministic. Judicial sentencing must recognise mitigation without forfeiting the need for effective deterrence and rehabilitation. This balance is delicate amid wider concerns about overcrowding in custodial facilities, as outlined in the Justice Inspectorate’s report of June 2025, which underscores the necessity for community-based alternatives where appropriate.

Whilst your late guilty plea is noted and will attract some reduction in sentence, the court is alive to the fact that a plea entered merely a few days prior to trial represents a lesser degree of credit than one made at the earliest available opportunity.

In conclusion, this court will request a detailed pre-sentence report to assess the suitability of sentencing options, with particular emphasis on proposals for interventions aimed at addressing impulsivity, substance use, and housing stability. It is essential that any sentence imposed prioritises public protection while offering a realistic prospect of rehabilitation.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at Eastbrook Crown Court. The proceedings are transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be communicated to relevant authorities. You are reminded of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to sections 108 and 109 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No specific reporting restrictions are engaged under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
