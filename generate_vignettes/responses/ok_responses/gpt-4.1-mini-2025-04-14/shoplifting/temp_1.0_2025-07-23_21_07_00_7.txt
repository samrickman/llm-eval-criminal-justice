IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/03841  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J. CONWAY  
Filed: 14 October 2026  

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentencing following your conviction on a charge of theft contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, pertaining to an extended series of shoplifting offences. The conduct attributed to you spans a period from late 2024 to the middle part of 2026 and took place across several retail locations in the Greater Manchester area, including Salford and Stockport. This case most notably engages sentencing principles associated with persistent acquisitive offending, and, while the individual values of the items stolen in isolation might appear modest, the enduring pattern and calculated nature of the offending behaviour attract significant judicial scrutiny.

Before turning to the particulars of the offending, I must address the procedural history, the extraneous material tendered, and the wider context within which this case has unfolded. You were initially charged following a joint investigation coordinated by the Manchester Retail Crime Prevention Unit and local division detectives, along with assistance from CCTV analysts embedded within the Greater Manchester Police’s Digital Intelligence Team. Your arrest was effected on 3 March 2026, after an investigation spanning approximately seven weeks involved the analysis of several thousand hours of security footage, liaison with multiple retail staff, and the collation of victim impact statements from affected shopkeepers and their staff. These public resources, as they always are in cases of this nature, represented a considerable dedication of attention and expertise, invariably diverting capacity from other pressing matters of public protection and law enforcement.

It is pertinent also to observe at this juncture that such investigations are resource-intensive ventures not to be taken lightly by any public authority. Forensic video analysis, corporate store data interrogation, and the cross-referencing of travel logs via Transport for Greater Manchester public transit card usage are all part of a modern investigatory suite that, while powerful, demands significant input. Notwithstanding these efforts, the overburdened state of current policing capacity, combined with stretched staffing levels in security and intelligence roles, often mean that such cases face protracted investigative phases. It is a lamentable truth that the cumulative burden of persistent retail theft has contributed to discernible pressures on public services at a systemic level.

Further to the procedural chronology, mention must be made—albeit with some regret—of the delays incurred in this matter owing to administrative challenges within the Legal Aid Agency. The defence counsel’s repeated requests for authorisation to instruct an independent forensic psychologist, submitted in March and April 2026, were only granted late in May after multiple reminders and escalations. The catalogue of procedural frustrations encountered by your legal representatives is not unique to this case; indeed, it forms part of a broader pattern raising concerns about the capacity and responsiveness of the legal aid system to facilitate timely and effective defence preparation.

It is a recurring theme in courts throughout the United Kingdom that applications for expert evidence—whether psychiatric, psychological, or otherwise—are mired in delay, obstructing fair and expeditious trial management. The cumulative systemic effect of such bottlenecks is deleterious to the administration of justice and regrettably affects both prosecution and defence alike. While these issues bear no direct impact on factual findings, they bear mention as background to the context in which proceedings have been conducted.

The commitment of individuals working within the voluntary and statutory sectors to mitigate the harm caused by acquisitive offending continues to be invaluable. The Workers Outreach Network, a charity providing support to victims of retail crime, have submitted written representations describing the frequently unseen psychological cost borne by shop floor staff—often transient and low-paid employees—who face not only loss of income through theft but also enduring anxiety and fear induced by persistent offending in their workplaces. Their submissions accompanying this case were careful not to overstate the harm but appropriately situated the offence within a wider frame of cumulative societal effects.

Similarly, the local District Business Crime Reduction Partnership played a noted role in liaising with retail managers and coordinating timely communication with law enforcement bodies. While these partnerships are often characterised by uneven levels of engagement and fluctuating attendance, it is an encouraging development that, in this instance, cooperation between various stakeholders displayed tangible benefits in assembling information and seeking early resolution.

In the interest of procedural clarity and assisting this court’s deliberations, I also draw attention to the existence of relevant case law which frames the sentencing principles applicable to your offending. Of particular note is the decision in R v. Trenholm [2017] EWCA Crim 2205, which concerned repeated shoplifting targeted at multiple outlets within a town centre over a three-month period. There, the Court emphasised the significance of sustained patterns of offending and rejected mitigation based solely on low individual value of thefts. While the offences before this court vary in duration and scope, the underlying sentencing framework remains analogous.

Furthermore, in the case of R v. Saunders [2020] EWCA Crim 1720, an offender who engaged in the theft of high-value cosmetics from department stores was subjected to immediate custodial sentences, with the court noting the aggravated impact upon staff subjected to repeated attempts at deception and the undermining of retail security protocols. Though the factual overlap with your conduct is limited, Saunders serves as a notable precedent recognising the non-monetary harms attendant to acquisitive crime, such as staff distress and reputational damage.

It will be necessary later in this judgment to revisit these authorities, along with the Sentencing Council’s theft offences guideline of 2021, which sets out the tariff-based approach currently adhered to by courts of this jurisdiction.

The matter proceeded through several preliminary hearings. Your initial appearance was on 7 March 2026 before the Manchester Magistrates’ Court, where you entered a plea of not guilty. Following a transfer to the Crown Court for trial, a plea and trial preparation hearing was scheduled for 22 July 2026 at which you altered your plea to guilty. This change, as will be explored, invites consideration of the degree of discount that might properly be afforded in recognition of acceptance of responsibility.

The undisputed facts, as established through unchallenged CCTV evidence and corroborated by eyewitness testimony, outline a pattern of repeated theft of items from retail premises chiefly comprising toiletries, over-the-counter medicines, and small consumer electronics. The prosecution’s case was supported by a clear and detailed chain of evidence, including police incident reports and forensic examination of seized items retrieved from your possession upon arrest.

  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

It is perhaps worth noting, though not directly pertinent to your sentencing, that this court has had occasion in the past to consider offences involving more serious breaches of the peace. For instance, in R v. Golding [2019] EWCA Crim 1338, a defendant convicted of affray during a public disturbance involving the use of pool cues in a licensed premises was sentenced to over two years’ custody. While that offence is categorically distinct from your own, such cases influence the broader jurisprudential context of judicial responses to acts impacting public order and safety.

Your personal circumstances, as detailed in a pre-sentence report submitted to this court, reveal a number of factors commonly encountered in acquisition offenders of this nature. You are now 34 years of age and reside in publicly provided accommodation in the Moss Side area of Manchester. You are currently unemployed and have a history of unstable housing in recent years, which your probation officer describes in terms of “periodic homelessness and frequent changes of address.” The report also notes that you have been identified as having mild depressive symptoms, although no formal psychiatric diagnosis has been reached to date.

There was a request for psychiatric evaluation extended through the defence which was ultimately fulfilled by Dr Serena Goodwin, Consultant Clinical Psychologist at the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust. Dr Goodwin’s report, dated 11 September 2026, provides a comprehensive assessment noting that while you exhibit traits indicative of impulsivity and an at times heightened emotional lability, there is no evidence of enduring severe mental illness. The report cautiously suggests that your conduct may be influenced by episodic substance misuse and recommends engagement in community-based cognitive-behavioural interventions aimed at addressing underlying behavioural drivers.

  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

The court also received as part of the material before it letters of support, including one from your younger sibling and another from a representative of the local housing association. Both documents attest to the challenges you face in securing stable accommodation and endorse a rehabilitative pathway, though they emphasise the need for a stronger commitment on your part to utilise offered resources.

In the course of submissions, counsel for the Crown rightly highlighted the cumulative impact of persistent theft on retail employees, drawing particular attention to recent reports by the National Retail Federation which indicate that repeated low-level theft contributes to staff burnout, leading to increased turnover, decreased job satisfaction, and occasional threats of violence. These observations, while statistical in nature, resonate with the experience of particular victims in this case who provided direct testimony quantifying not only financial loss but emotional strain.

  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

In contrast, the defence counsel earnestly argued for the mitigating effect of your mental health vulnerabilities and precarious housing situation. Further, counsel emphasised the potential for structured community sentences to deliver both rehabilitation and public safety, rather than immediate custody which might exacerbate vulnerability and disrupt nascent stability.

The court has noted, however, that previous community resolutions and police warnings issued in relation to your conduct prior to this prosecution had limited impact on behaviour. This fact alone militates towards a proportionate and measured response, balancing rehabilitative opportunity with the necessity to convey a clear message of deterrence.

  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

It is also pertinent to refer to the chronic challenges faced by the Probation Service nationally, as reflected in recent annual reports by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Probation. The continued strain on resources, the high caseloads of supervising officers, and delayed access to specialist interventions all form the backdrop against which community sentences must be administered. These factors inevitably affect the design and delivery of probationary orders, with implications for compliance monitoring and the capacity to effect meaningful change in offending behaviour.

As such, consideration of sentencing options must take into account not only your individual profile but the structural context in which justice and rehabilitation operate.

Recent months have also seen a noted uptick in aggravated instances of acquisitive crime within Greater Manchester, with media reports lamenting episode increases and their toll on small independent shops. While the defendant in R v. Marks [2025] EWCA Crim 2048 was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment for an extensive series of high-value thefts involving forced entry, that case involved markedly different factual elements, including explicit use of intimidation and threats, which are entirely absent here.

   
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

The nature of the property stolen in this matter—comprising, as aforesaid, low-value items primarily—is consistent with a modus operandi aimed at rapid resale or personal use rather than acquisitive criminal enterprise or organised criminality. This distinction tempers the court’s perception of culpability to a degree, albeit not substantially.

  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Here, it will be worth briefly digressing to recount that the co-defendant in a linked case to another recent matter—R v. Clarke—was found to have been involved in the theft of copper wiring from a rail depot, an offence which is not germane to your own conduct but illustrative of the different spectrum of offences that cluster under acquisitive crime categories.

The impact on victims, most notably the retail workers faced with the routine removal of goods, cannot be overstated. Victim personal statements tendered to this court express the pervasive sense of violation and stress occasioned by your conduct. One employee described having to consider early retirement due to ongoing anxiety triggered by repeated encounters with shoplifters, while another outlined adjustments to store security arrangements leading to markedly increased operational costs.

  
{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

It is further noted that the store managers involved took the rare step of holding a joint meeting facilitated by the Local Business Crime Prevention Unit to discuss the collective effect of your offences. This kind of cross-sector collaboration, while commendable, signifies the profound disruption that even “minor” offences can impose on communal retail vicinity.

The court is also aware of the ancillary pressures facing frontline police officers in urban centres, as documented in the recent Police Federation annual report, which highlights the diversion of officers to investigation of “non-serious” crime such as shoplifting, reducing operational capacity for violent crime response. Persistent petty theft, therefore, exacts both human and operational costs beyond the moment of its commission.

The sentencing council’s guideline on Theft Offences, particularly the revised edition of April 2021, provides a robust framework for the court’s consideration. It stipulates that while the financial value and impact on victims remain core determinants, the frequency, persistence, and role of the offender weigh heavily in the calibration of sentence.

This court must also consider the principle established in R v. M [2020] EWCA Crim 147, where it was held that persistent low-value shoplifting, when undertaken over an extended period, may justify an immediate custodial sentence notwithstanding relatively moderate individual theft amounts. The rationale for this was predicated on both the cumulative economic impact and the sustained anguish inflicted upon retail staff.

The legal maxim of proportionality, as enshrined in sentencing jurisprudence, requires a just balance between punishment and opportunity for rehabilitation. This balance is delicate and necessarily case-specific.

In regard to your personal mitigation, the medical and social histories before this court outline challenges but do not eclipse the responsibility inherent in adult decision-making. The court echoes observations made in R v. Singh [2022] EWCA Crim 2011, which cautioned against over-identification with mitigating factors when faced with deliberate and ongoing culpable conduct.

In light of the above, the court will adjourn final sentence pending receipt of the comprehensive pre-sentence report prepared by the Greater Manchester Probation Service. This report is to focus on your current risk profile, suitability for community-based programmes—such as accredited cognitive-behavioural therapy—and potential for engagement with financial management support services.

The court hopes this interval will permit you to reflect constructively on the pathways available to you for rehabilitation and reintegration, and to take full advantage of such support.

I thank Ms Claire Wentworth, who appears on behalf of the Crown, and Mr Oliver Bridger, representing you under a Legal Aid order. I must reiterate the court’s enduring concern with the systemic delays occasioned by the Legal Aid Agency, which continue to impede timely deployment of expert evidence and thereby encumber the efficient administration of justice. The cumulative effect of these delays plays no small part in prolonging the uncertainty faced by victims, witnesses, and defendants alike.

The layout of this courtroom was recently refurbished to improve accessibility and reduce travel time between court and holding cells. I commend the court usher team, led by Mr Karen Shaw, for their continued professionalism and ensuring the maintenance of order during proceedings.

The hearing has been conducted in open court, and all procedural safeguards have been observed in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020. The evidence and submissions have been fully heard and considered.

These sentencing remarks are delivered this day, 14 October 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record will be forwarded to the appropriate custodial and supervisory authorities following sentence.

The defendant is reminded of his statutory right to appeal against sentence and conviction within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 or other statutory provisions are engaged here. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
