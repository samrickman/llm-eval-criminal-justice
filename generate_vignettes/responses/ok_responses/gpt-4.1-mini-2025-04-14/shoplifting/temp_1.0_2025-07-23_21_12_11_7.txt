IN THE CROWN COURT AT STRATFORD  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13856  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. W. FAIRHALL  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you face sentencing today in respect of offences of theft from retail establishments, specifically shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The charges relate to a pattern of conduct spanning several months in the year 2024, involving multiple incidents across various retail outlets within the Greater Stratford area. Your persistent engagement in this offending conduct provides the basis upon which this court’s sentencing discretion must be exercised.  

The procedural history of this matter is both illustrative and, regrettably, representative of the systemic challenges that continue to beset the criminal justice process when dealing with acquisitive crime of this nature. Your initial arrest occurred on 8 November 2024, following an investigation initiated by the Stratford Retail Crime Taskforce in conjunction with the local policing team and supported by the Multi-Agency Acquisitive Crime Unit.  

The investigative phase necessitated considerable coordination and resource allocation across agencies — an effort compounded by the inherent difficulties of assembling compelling evidence in shoplifting cases. Despite the sophistication of modern surveillance technologies, many incidents of retail theft remain undetected or unprosecuted due to the inherent limitations of camera coverage, store layout, and witness availability. Officers assigned to your case undertook an exhaustive collation of security footage, store loss prevention reports, and witness statements. It is regrettable but essential to acknowledge that such investigations typically absorb disproportionate quantities of the limited time and capacity of front-line officers, detracting from other pressing matters such as violent offences and organised crime.  

Your initial interview under police caution was conducted on 11 November 2024. At that juncture, you denied any wrongdoing. However, subsequent forensic evidence — including the recovery of clothing consistent with surveillance footage — established a clear evidential link. You were formally charged with seven counts of theft, which were consolidated for administrative efficiency and listed for trial at this Crown Court.  

The Better Case Management (BCM) process was engaged, intended to expedite proceedings while safeguarding the procedural rights of all parties. I note, in this instance, that court listings proceeded largely in line with the Criminal Procedure Rules, notwithstanding minor delays occasioned by resource constraints in the Legal Aid Agency and the probation service. Such pressures have been the subject of frequent commentary by this court and others.  

It is well known that securing expert reports in cases of acquisitive crime — particularly those involving defendants with possible underlying vulnerabilities — is frequently hampered by protracted administrative hurdles at the Legal Aid Agency, often manifesting as delayed funding decisions and repetitive clarifications. This complexity burdens defence representatives and courts alike, delaying justice in ways that serve no public interest. In this matter, applications for psychiatric assessment and risk evaluation were sanctioned only after considerable correspondence and follow-up, ultimately contributing to the adjournment of the initial sentence hearing scheduled for 5 August 2025.  

In preparation for the sentencing hearing, the court received a detailed report from Dr Anika Shah, a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist. Dr Shah’s report carefully assesses your mental health, considering the possibility of neurodevelopmental difficulties and the influence of stressors such as housing instability and employment challenges. Her conclusion was that you present with borderline traits in executive functioning and exhibit impulsivity, but do not suffer from a major mental illness warranting hospitalisation or immediate clinical intervention. Her prognosis, while cautious, acknowledges your expressed willingness — albeit intermittent — to engage with community services aimed at rehabilitation.  

I also acknowledge the comprehensive pre-sentence report compiled by Ms Julia Travers of the Stratford Probation Directorate. Ms Travers notes your history of intermittent employment, previous convictions related to theft, and ongoing difficulties in engaging meaningfully with support networks. It is important to note that these reports, though thorough and professionally composed, serve in large part to contextualise rather than excuse conduct, and it is incumbent upon the court to weigh this contextual material appropriately within the statutory framework.  

The court is keenly aware of the broader social context: the increasing visibility of homelessness and precarious housing in the Greater Stratford area, rising levels of economic precarity, and the extent to which these factors exert pressure on public services. The challenges faced by the local charity sector — including organisations such as Stratford Support Network and the East London Food Bank Collective — are acute, as they endeavor to provide empathetic assistance despite severe underfunding and staffing shortages exacerbated by the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. Their written representations to the court commend efforts to offer non-punitive support to individuals in crisis, while signalling the limits of their reach in the absence of systemic investment. I extend the court’s recognition of these efforts, which though peripheral to sentencing decisions remain part of the communal fabric within which offending and rehabilitation occur.  

Meanwhile, cases such as this increasingly draw attention to the demands placed upon the police service by non-violent acquisitive crimes. Stratford Borough Police have documented a steady rise in reported shoplifting incidents over the past three years, reflecting a widening trend documented at metropolitan and national levels. Footage review workloads within the unit’s digital forensics unit have proliferated, often lagging months behind live events due to understaffing. Frontline officers report the mental and physical strain of frequent encounters with repeat offenders, noting that the absence of effective diversionary pathways frustrates efforts to break cycles of offending.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

It is instructive to recall the appropriate legal framework that governs sentencing in theft offences. The Theft Act 1968 provides a clear statutory basis, defining the elements required for conviction and sanction. Sentencing decisions must reflect the statutory objectives set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003; specifically, punishment, deterrence (both individual and general), rehabilitation, and protection of the public. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences reinforces the significance of context—namely, the value of the stolen property, the frequency of offending, the impact on victims, and any aggravating or mitigating features.  

In recent appellate jurisprudence, courts have grappled with the boundaries between culpability and mitigating factors in cases where vulnerability and need are intertwined with repeated acquisitive behaviour. For example, the Court of Appeal in R v. Dellinger [2023] EWCA Crim 1342 underscored that persistent thefts motivated by addiction present a complex profile requiring a balanced approach that neither diminishes accountability nor overlooks the potential for harm reduction through targeted intervention. Conversely, in R v. Beaumont [2022] EWCA Crim 1609, the court affirmed the availability of custodial sentences where there is clear evidence of calculated offending accompanied by escalation despite community sentences. Both cases highlight that a nuanced, fact-sensitive determination is required.  

The court is reminded of the passage from R v. Paxon [2021] EWCA Crim 1948, wherein Elias LJ emphasised that “the court must never lose sight of the impact on victims, no matter how small the individual loss may seem.” This principle has particular resonance in cases of shoplifting, where victims often include small business proprietors, local employees, and wider community stakeholders who suffer direct economic and psychological consequences.  

Additionally, I am conscious of the fact that this court is regularly presented with cases featuring late guilty pleas. While the law encourages early admissions of guilt as a means of expediting justice and sparing victims the ordeal of contested trials, counsel and courts remain vigilant against tactical pleas entered solely upon the collapse of defences. Credit for guilty pleas follows a graduated scale, reflecting timing and sincerity as well as procedural benefit. The present matter is no exception to these considerations.  

The court values the submissions made on your behalf by Mr Dominic Cairns, who appears under a representation order granted by the Legal Aid Agency. Despite the Agency’s well-documented constraints, Mr Cairns has provided thorough and conscientious representation, including making detailed applications for expert assessment and seeking adjournments to facilitate preparation. I note also the earnest and measured submissions from Ms Holly Jennings, appearing for the Crown, who has placed before the court a clear exposition of the case facts and the prosecution’s stance concerning public interest and sentencing.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

Given the duration over which the offences took place, and their repetition at various locations, this is demonstrably not a one-off lapse nor a momentary act of desperation. The sustained nature of your offending, coupled with the pattern of behaviour disclosed by surveillance and witness accounts, demonstrates a familiarity with the stores targeted as well as techniques employed to evade detection.  

Historical case law includes a range of examples touching upon behavioural patterns relevant to persistent shoplifting. For instance, in R v. Perkins [2019] EWCA Crim 566, the court considered a defendant whose thefts were characterised by the removal of high-use consumables from local pharmacies. Though the total value was modest, the repeated impact upon vulnerable staff was found to amplify culpability. Another instructive case is R v. Grantham [2018] EWCA Crim 2031, which dealt with a defendant who escalated from retail theft to operating a small-scale fencing ring — a progression noted as aggravating in sentencing. Though neither fact pattern precisely parallels the current matter, they inform the court’s understanding of the continuum of risk and the societal harm attributable to acquisitive offending.  

Moreover, the court cannot disregard the wider criminological context. The proliferation of social media “challenges” including demonstrations of theft and disruption in public spaces, as observed by the National Retail Crime Survey 2023, poses novel challenges to deterrence efforts. Though no evidence in this matter suggests direct involvement in such media activities, the cultural milieu nonetheless shapes offender attitudes and public perceptions.  

The court is gratified to note the relatively measured approach of local retailers affected in this matter. Outreach from the Stratford Retail Crime Partnership included liaison with shop managers who provided victim impact statements, some of which illustrate the emotional toll of repeated encounters with offenders. One witness described feeling “watchful and anxious” during shifts, while another noted increased instances of theft necessitating tighter security, adversely affecting community relations. Such remarks are not to evoke sympathy but to ground the court’s appreciation for the harm caused.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Further procedural considerations bear mentioning. The case was listed initially for sentence on 15 August 2025 but was adjourned at defence request to allow for the preparation of psychiatric and probation reports. This adjournment, although regrettable from a listing perspective, was consistent with the court’s duty to ensure fairness and an informed exercise of discretion. The judicial calendar at Stratford Crown Court remains heavily burdened owing to ongoing resource shortfalls, compounded by recent industrial action by court staff in July 2025, which disrupted multiple sittings across criminal and civil divisions.  

Such operational realities do not kindly soliloquise upon the plight of defendants nor the anxieties of victims, but they form the real backdrop against which justice is administered. The court is therefore appreciative of the patience exhibited by all parties and the professionalism of the clerk’s office, which despite under-resourcing has maintained orderly progress.  

Another matter of note concerns the Legal Aid Agency’s continuing difficulties in vetting and approving funding requests for expert witnesses. This pattern, regrettably persistent across multiple Crown Courts nationwide, adds layers of complexity and delay to what ought to be straightforward procedural steps. The court encourages ongoing dialogue between judicial stakeholders and the Agency to mitigate these systemic shortcomings.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

The court must also address the question of your personal circumstances. At the age of 34, you have a limited but notable criminal record, predominantly for acquisitive offences including previous cautions and a conditional discharge issued in 2022 after charges of shoplifting and low-level fraud. Your recorded history reflects a pattern of repeated offending interspersed with periods of apparent compliance and attempts at rehabilitation.  

Dr Shah’s report, supported by probation findings, suggests that while there is no diagnosed psychosis or major depressive illness, you exhibit a constellation of traits including impulsivity, fleeting motivation, and intermittent engagement with addiction services that merit focused intervention. Despite offers of assistance from local agencies — including substance misuse services and employment support programmes — uptake has been inconsistent.  

It warrants remarking that the challenges of engaging indigent defendants with multi-layered vulnerabilities are well documented in the academic and clinical literatures. Yet the availability of such services, constrained though it may be, invites cooperation, and repeated refusal cannot be overlooked in assessing culpability and risk. It is one thing to encounter systemic obstacles; it is quite another to decline to avail oneself of the remedies provided.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

Turning to the impact of offending, the court notes that while monetary values may appear modest by commercial standards, the geometric accumulation of losses and associated costs to businesses — for example, through the installation and maintenance of security systems, staff retraining, and altered operational practices — must be appreciated. The broader cost to the economy in lost sales, insurance premiums, and diminished community confidence is significant.  

The employee testimonies present a picture of diminished workplace morale and anxiety, with some staff reportedly seeking transfers or raising health and safety concerns linked to the increased incidence of theft-related disturbances. These outcomes underscore the tangible harm of your conduct beyond the immediate act of concealment and removal of goods.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

Reference must also be made to the court’s well-established position on pleas entered at an advanced stage. Your guilty plea was entered on the morning of trial. While it is welcomed that you have accepted responsibility, the timing of that plea significantly curtails the credit to which you are entitled. Litigants and their legal representatives should not underestimate the negative effect that late admissions have on the efficient conduct of justice, the welfare of victims, and confidence in the system.  

In line with leading authorities including R v. Griffiths [2022] EWCA Crim 905 and R v. Mason [2023] EWCA Crim 412, which underscore the principle that discounts diminish as the case progresses toward trial, this court will apply only a modest reduction for your plea.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

The sentencing framework articulated by the Sentencing Council requires identification of the offence category and the totality of harm, the offender’s culpability, and any aggravating or mitigating features. While you present a limited record of previous theft convictions, the court acknowledges your age and relative lack of violence or threat in your offending style. That said, persistence despite prior intervention is a material aggravating consideration.  

I therefore direct the preparation of a further pre-sentence report, focused on risk and suitability for community sentence frameworks. The probation service is requested to consider, in particular, the viability of attendance at accredited offending behaviour programmes targeting acquisitive conduct, cognitive behavioural therapy initiatives, and any ancillary support addressing substance misuse and housing instability. Assessment should also identify the potential for restorative justice engagement with affected businesses, subject to their agreement. The court is mindful that such approaches, while not universally effective, offer meaningful alternatives to custody where compliance is realistic.   

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

In concluding these remarks, it remains necessary to punctuate the proceedings with a sober recognition of the difficult balance the court must maintain. While compassion and contextual awareness inform sentencing, they do not confer impunity. The protection of the public, promotion of law-abiding conduct, and just sanction require firmness tempered by appropriate moderation.  

This matter will be adjourned for sentence on receipt and consideration of the updated report, which I direct to be served no later than four weeks from today’s date. It is anticipated that all counsel will liaise with probation promptly to ensure timely preparation and disclosure of necessary information.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Stratford Crown Court, Court 5. Proceedings have been transcribed under the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
