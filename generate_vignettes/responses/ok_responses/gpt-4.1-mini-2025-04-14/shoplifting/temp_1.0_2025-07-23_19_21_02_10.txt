IN THE CROWN COURT AT BOW CHAMBERS  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/15499  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. MONTGOMERY  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence upon a charge of theft—specifically, persistent shoplifting—from multiple retail premises over an extended period, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct, as the prosecution alleges and as the admitted facts clearly demonstrate, occurred intermittently from late 2023 through the spring of 2025 in various retail settings across the North London area. The case has traversed procedural complexities, including multiple pre-trial hearings, expert report submissions, and significant inter-agency collaboration.

Procedural History and Court Administration Context  
Your initial police interview took place on 12 May 2025, following a prolonged covert inquiry coordinated chiefly by the North London Metropolitan Police’s Anti-Acquisitive Crime Unit, supplemented by input from the Commercial Crime Division and Crime Scene Investigators attached to the Operational Support Group. This investigation was triggered by repeated complaints from a cluster of medium-sized and independent convenience stores broached by the North London Crime Prevention Partnership, a multi-agency forum consisting of local policing representatives, retail security managers, community safety officers, and council enforcement units. The works of the Partnership, while formally well regarded, have come under recurrent scrutiny for their variable efficacy owing to resourcing constraints and attendance irregularities.  

It bears mention, for the record, that the Partnership’s annual report of February 2025 highlighted a 12% uptick in retail thefts in the boroughs under its remit, despite incremental gains in community outreach programs and the advent of targeted deterrence patrols run jointly by police and local council wardens. Moreover, the digitally enabled witness campaigns—though conceptually promising—have suffered from insufficient integration with traditional policing data systems, leading to occasional lapses in intelligence sharing and operational coordination. Notwithstanding these bureaucratic hurdles, the case before this court does present a relatively well-documented record, largely attributable to the diligence of the investigating officers and the persistence of affected retailers.  

Following your arrest on 30 April 2025, you were charged on 8 June 2025, and the matter was transferred to this Crown Court under the auspices of the Better Case Management (BCM) framework—a procedure aimed at expediting case progression while reducing the burden on litigants and the judiciary. The BCM designation prompted the listing of prompt case management hearings (CMH), status conferences, and evidence disclosure deadlines, which although generally complied with, occasioned some delay owing to the late commissioning and submission of a psychiatric report requested by the defence.

It is necessary to express, with some reservation, the court’s dissatisfaction with the protracted timeframe in which authority to instruct an independent psychiatrist was obtained. Despite multiple reminders issued by this court and defence counsel’s persistent efforts, the application lodged with the Legal Aid Agency was not approved until late July 2025, resulting in adjournments that could have been avoided with more timely administrative responses. These procedural inefficiencies, while regrettably endemic in the current climate, nonetheless place defendants in a state of limbo and risk undermining confidence in the justice process. That said, the court acknowledges the professionalism of the appointed expert, Dr Josephine Faraday, whose report was critical in informing the sentencing exercise.

Prior to your plea, a contested pre-trial review was arranged on 22 August 2025. At that hearing, you intimated a firm acceptance of responsibility and entered a plea of guilty to the representative count, which amalgamated multiple alleged incidents for sentencing purposes. Such a late plea is not uncommon in cases of this nature, although it necessarily tempers the degree of judicial credit that may be afforded, given the inefficiencies imposed on victims, witnesses, and the administration of justice.

It is an unfortunate but densely documented feature of contemporary criminal justice that defendants often await the point of overwhelming evidence before conceding guilt, basing the decision less upon remorse or moral reckoning and more on pragmatic calculation. In this respect, the court regards the principles amplified in R v. Dacres [2021] EWCA Crim 1331 and R v. McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145 as notably instructive. Both authorities endorse a cautious approach to plea discounting where admissions are tactical and belated, notwithstanding the inevitable procedural economy they secure.

I also take opportunity here to acknowledge the distinction drawn in R v. Haswell [2021] EWCA Crim 1754, which clarifies that even in cases involving complex forensic evidence and contested issues, a plea entered after significant pre-trial preparation cannot attract the full reduction otherwise available.

Victim Impact and Community Service Observations  
The court has considered detailed victim impact statements received from a number of retail managers and employees who endured not only direct financial loss, but also consequential stress, decreased workplace morale, and a pervasive sense of insecurity. Of note, one manager at the Lilac Co-operative store described having had to tighten security protocols considerably, leading to a reduction in the store’s operating hours and a reallocation of staff duties to minimise lone working. This adjustment, while unfortunate, was necessary in response to your repeat presence on site and the associated apprehension staff felt.

In parallel, correspondence received on behalf of the North London Retail Workers Union underscores the cumulative emotional toll placed upon shopfloor employees by persistent, low-level retail crime, situating these incidents within a broader discourse on occupational hazards and mental health vulnerabilities in front-line retail employment. While such representations are often ancillary, they are valued for providing the court with a fuller appreciation of the human dimension beyond abstract monetary losses.

There has been some attention paid to the work of the Retail Restoration Support Network, a voluntary organisation offering practical and emotional assistance to businesses and employees affected by shop theft and related disruptions. Their submissions, while not directly determinative, highlight ongoing challenges faced by the sector, including rising insurance costs, increased staff turnover, and the erosion of community trust.

It should be noted as well that the defendant’s letter to court, submitted in advance of sentencing, reflects an awareness of the distress his conduct has caused and expresses tentative regret; the handwriting is neat, legible, and carefully arranged, suggestive of genuine though cautious engagement.

Legal and Sentencing Context  
The charge before this court falls squarely within the ambit of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, a statute which, since its enactment, has been subject to numerous interpretive refinements and supplementary jurisprudence. Though an old statute in origin, it remains the fundamental legal instrument for prosecuting theft, encompassing the appropriation of property belonging to another with requisite dishonest intent and an intention to permanently deprive.

Statutory and advisory sentencing guidance recognises the wide spectrum of offending behaviour encompassed under “theft,” requiring a fact-sensitive approach that accounts for the value of goods stolen, the vulnerability of victims, and the defendant’s antecedents and culpability.

The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft emphasises the aggravating impact of repeated offending, the exploitation of vulnerable premises or persons, and the disruption caused to small independent businesses.

In this case, though a single representative charge is proceeded upon, the court sentences for the series of incidents it encapsulates, taking account of the sustained nature of the conduct.

While the court finds analogy in cases involving low-value but persistent dishonesty, it has also considered the wider jurisprudence addressing the calibration of custody in property offences. The benchmarks established in R v. Latimer [2021] EWCA Crim 947—which involved coordinated self-checkout manipulations—bear some tangential relevance to the principle of deterrence in retail theft, albeit the factual details differ.

Equally, the Court’s approach in R v. Blackwell [2020] EWCA Crim 1129 on aggravated trespass and its psychological impact on vulnerable victims resonates in the present matter concerning the emotional harm to retail employees.

It is permissible also to note the contrast with regulatory offences under the Environmental Protection Act, such as R v. Pendry [2017] EWCA Crim 2080, where repeated unlawful waste disposal, albeit non-violent, drew custodial sanctions by virtue of the cumulative harm and disregard for social norms. Such cases remind us that patterns of recurrent minor breaches can yield significant public costs, a principle that finds echo in acquisitive crime.

Similarly, while wholly unrelated to this offence, the robust sentences upheld in drug importation cases such as R v. Haslow [2021] EWCA Crim 1754 sustain the broader principle that the scale, timing, and context of conduct dictate sentencing severity.

It is clear from the caselaw that the court must balance the competing objectives of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection, and that multiple prior opportunities for intervention or diversion weigh heavily in the sentencing calculus.

Treatment of Late Guilty Pleas and Procedural Credit  
As rehearsed, your plea was entered late in the proceedings, at a stage when the evidential case was well established and the trial date imminent. The approach to credit in such circumstances is well-settled, as affirmed in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, where the Court emphasised the reduced mitigation afforded for pleas emerging from tactical considerations rather than genuine contrition.

The court also notes, with approval, the procedural rigour undertaken in the Better Case Management stages, notwithstanding challenges posed by Legal Aid delays and evidential assembly. The diligence of Crown Counsel, Ms. Eleanor Rigby, and defence Counsel, Mr. Jacob Fry, in navigating the procedural complexities is appreciated.

While the prosecution sought a community impact statement from the Safer Neighbourhoods Team, the constraints of the multi-agency workload meant that only a brief report was possible. This was nonetheless relevant in underlining the broader communal concern regarding acquisitive crime trends in this locality.

Criminal Intelligence and Policing Resources  
In addition to the investigation specifics, it is necessary to note the wider pressures confronting policing resources in this jurisdiction. The North London Metropolitan Police have reported increased demand on their commercial crime units, arising from a confluence of factors including rising acquisitive offences, reductions in workforce numbers, and the growing complexity of digital investigative methods required to process evidence.

This is not a unique circumstance, and similar strains have been documented nationally, as chronicled in the Home Office’s annual crime statistics report for 2024.

The intensive CCTV review, including facial recognition algorithms trialled in pilot schemes though the subject of public debate regarding privacy concerns, underscore the resource intensiveness of contemporary retail crime prosecutions.

The court is conscious that while the costs incurred for this investigation are quantifiable, the opportunity cost in terms of diverted resources from other public safety priorities is less easily measured but equally significant.

Expert Psychiatric and Probation Assessments  
Dr Faraday’s psychiatric report provides a considered evaluation of your mental health status. While no major psychiatric disorder was diagnosed, there are noted features suggestive of personality traits associated with impulsivity, emotional lability, and a degree of cognitive distortion regarding risk and consequence. Importantly, she remarks upon mild depressive symptoms and a stated history of episodic substance misuse, though this is not considered severe or enduring.

While mental health support could be beneficial, the report emphasises that the relationship between your psychological presentation and offending behaviour is not straightforward. There is no indication of diminished responsibility. Your engagement with voluntary services has been inconsistent, and you have declined previous opportunities for structured intervention.

Informed by this report and the pre-sentence assessment by Ms. Nicola White of the Probation Service, it is clear that your offending poses a moderate risk of harm, primarily to commercial interests, with limited indications of escalation or violence.

The probation report also outlines your lack of stable housing, periods of unemployment, and weak social support networks, factors that may augment vulnerability but are not, in themselves, mitigating for the purposes of sentencing.

These assessments serve as a reminder of the multifaceted nature of offending. They indicate potential avenues for rehabilitation, including cognitive skills training, substance misuse counselling, and housing support referrals, though they counsel circumspection due to historic non-engagement.

The court recognises the efforts made by local charities, including HopeAhead and ShelterNet, whose caseworkers have written in to confirm continuing willingness to assist you post-sentence, particularly in the domains of housing and financial advice.

Prior Convictions and Community Impact  
Records reveal that you are a 33-year-old male with a history of acquisitive offending, including three previous convictions for shoplifting and one conditional discharge imposed in 2022. This pattern, regrettably, demonstrates persistence despite prior opportunities for diversion or rehabilitative intervention.

I am mindful of the court’s obligation to consider the cumulative community harm occasioned by such persistence, as underscored in R v. McArthur [2020] EWCA Crim 822, where custodial penalties were upheld for repeat acquisitive offending given demonstrable erosion of public confidence and retail worker wellbeing.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

The offence conduct has inflicted wider economic damage through increased inventory losses, higher insurance premiums, and ancillary security expenditure. The societal cost extends beyond immediate victims, affecting local jobs, consumer choice, and the fabric of community retail provision.

Furthermore, victim impact statements affirm the psychological toll on shop staff, some of whom have resorted to early retirement or relocation owing to the repeated offences and resulting anxiety.

Sentencing Principles and Options  
This court is guided by the Sentencing Council’s guidelines on theft offences, applying the principles of proportionality, public protection, deterrence, and rehabilitation.

Custodial sentences remain available and appropriate where offending indicates deliberate, premeditated behaviour, especially when coupled with failure to heed previous interventions.

Nevertheless, the court recognises the potential utility of community sentencing options, including rehabilitation activity requirements, unpaid work, and cognitive skills programmes, as mechanisms to address underlying causes and facilitate desistance.

The court will require a comprehensive pre-sentence report to evaluate the suitability of these options, including a risk assessment and an analysis of the feasibility of community-based interventions within your current circumstances.

Consideration will be given to the potential for restorative justice engagement, in so far as this is consistent with the interests and wishes of victims.

These remarks have been prepared in open court, at Bow Chambers Crown Court, Courtroom 5, on this day, 14 September 2025. I thank counsel for their submissions—Ms Eleanor Rigby for the Crown and Mr Jacob Fry on behalf of the defence—for their diligent work in this matter.

A fully transcribed record has been made pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. You are reminded of your right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing, under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions engaged pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.

I will adjourn sentencing to allow the probation service time to compile the pre-sentence report and any further relevant submissions from either party.

These are the orders of the court.
