IN THE CROWN COURT AT MIDDLESBOROUGH  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/15429  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. P. Astbury  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before the court today for sentencing on a charge brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, pertaining to a series of shoplifting offences committed across several retail premises in the Middlesbrough and Redcar areas over a protracted period spanning from mid-2023 until February 2025. The indictment represents a consolidated charge for what the prosecution alleges to be a repeated and deliberate course of conduct involving the misappropriation of goods without payment.

Procedural History  
Your arrest took place on 2 March 2025 after a coordinated operation involving officers from the Cleveland Police Retail Crime Team, the Middlesbrough Business Crime Reduction Group, and specialists from the Regional Digital Forensics Unit. The investigative efforts were precipitated by a spike in reported thefts from convenience stores and pharmacies within a relatively confined radius. It was initially difficult to establish links between the incidents. However, over the course of several weeks, the collation of CCTV footage, witness statements, and loss prevention records progressed to reveal a consistent pattern of offending, culminating in your detention.  

It is worth reflecting, in passing, on the historical development of retail crime enforcement in this jurisdiction. The establishment of the Middlesbrough Business Crime Reduction Group in 2014 sought to bring together retailers, law enforcement, and local authorities in a proactive and collaborative manner. Its efficacy has been variable, often dependent on staffing availability, priorities, and funding streams subject to local government austerity. While the Group has recorded some success in addressing organised retail crime and violent incidents, low-level repeated acquisitive offending remains a persistent challenge. This case is emblematic of those difficulties.  

At the hearing on 14 March 2025, you reserved your plea. The matter progressed to a plea and trial preparation hearing on 15 May 2025. It was at that stage, following further evidential disclosure and consultation with counsel, that you entered a plea of guilty to the sole charge. This plea, though ultimately accepted, was entered significantly later than is generally encouraged in cases seeking early resolution benefits.  

There was an application on your behalf for the instruction of an independent psychiatric expert, which precipitated some delay. The Legal Aid Agency’s handling of that application was less than exemplary. Despite repeated requests and supplementary submissions by your instructing solicitors, the authorisation was granted only on 25 July 2025, some six weeks after initial application. This impeded the timely preparation of expert evidence and ultimately the court’s ability to proceed without adjournment. Such delay is regrettable but, sadly, a recurring theme across the legal aid landscape in recent years. Courts, counsel, and defendants all bear the consequences of this protracted procedure.  

These matters aside, the case conformed generally to Better Case Management (BCM) protocols. Evidence disclosure, witness statements, and necessary pre-trial briefs were exchanged within the timeframes prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Rules. I acknowledge the cooperation of both prosecution and defence teams in this regard, and in particular I commend the efforts of Ms Amina Salim, who appears for the Crown, and Mr Joshua Fairbank, representing you under a Legal Aid order.

By way of context, it may be helpful to locate these proceedings within the evolving landscape of sentencing law pertaining to acquisitive offences. The Theft Act 1968 remains the primary legislative instrument governing offences of this type, with section 1 articulating the fundamental parameters around dishonest appropriation. However, over the past decades, various amendments and statutory instruments have complicated its operation, particularly in respect of threshold values, repeat offending, and diversionary options. The Sentencing Council’s Theft Guideline, last comprehensively revised in 2021, provides a framework that balances culpability, harm, and mitigating factors in cases of acquisitive crime. This court applies that framework diligently, mindful that the guideline itself also embeds the domestic and international legal principles articulated under the Crown Prosecution Service’s guidance.  

Notably, the case law reviewed in preparation for these remarks includes the seminal decisions in R v. Smythe [2018] EWCA Crim 907, which addressed the proportionality of custodial sentences for repeat shoplifters, and R v. Edmonds [2022] EWCA Crim 467, which underscored the importance of addressing underlying factors contributing to offending such as substance misuse and chaotic lifestyles, when weighing sentencing options. Although the facts vary in detail from Mr H’s case, these authorities assist in the calibration of an appropriate response.   

It is necessary to recall, too, the cautionary observations made in R v. Culpepper [2019] EWCA Crim 1153. There, the court emphasised that the mere presence of a psychiatric diagnosis does not, in itself, justify mitigation or obviation of custodial penalties, particularly where the offending demonstrates a marked disregard for societal norms or recidivism despite available interventions. That principle has relevance here in light of the reports received.  

We find ourselves, at present, in an environment characterised by heightened awareness of acquisitive crime’s corrosive effect on community cohesion and local businesses. While the monetary values involved may seem modest on their face, the cumulative impact over time – particularly in small, independently-run shops – is disproportionately damaging, both economically and psychologically. Retail workers report heightened anxiety, staff turnover increases as morale falters, and some businesses face closure due to unmanageable shrinkage and reputational harm. This is not an abstract concern but one that touches the fabric of neighbourhoods directly. It is within that reality that the court must situate the facts herein.

In several respects, the operational challenges faced by law enforcement parallel those encountered by the retail sector. The Cleveland Police South Tees Division has endured repeated funding cuts over recent years, notably since the austerity measures introduced in 2010. Frontline officers, crime analysts, and community liaison officers find themselves stretched between responding to serious violent crime, antisocial behaviour, and the increasing volume of acquisitive offences. The investigative work underpinning your arrest necessitated the reallocation of valuable staff from other priority areas, underscoring the systemic cost of what might otherwise be regarded as “minor” crime.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

Yet, as is well-recognised, the threshold between “minor” and “serious” offence is not solely one of monetary value but of cumulative social effect. The disruptive potential of persistent shoplifting touches upon neglected corners of public safety and social trust, as elaborated in recent contemplations on neighbourhood policing by the Home Office Research Unit.  

Of course, this court is not equipped to adjudicate wider social policy, nor to critique budgetary decisions of government. Nonetheless, awareness of these contextual pressures frames the sentencing task.  

A co-defendant in the same investigation, who is not before the court today, was charged with unrelated offences of affray following an altercation at a public house in Redcar, involving multiple patrons and pool cues. That matter proceeded separately at the magistrates’ court and resulted in a community order with unpaid work. It is proper to acknowledge that, in multi-defendant investigations, charges may diverge significantly, even where temporal or geographical overlap exists.

Turning now to the victim impact statement and related evidence, accounts from staff at several targeted premises detail heightened stress and procedural adjustments necessitated by your offending. One manager noted that, following your repeated shoplifting incidents, staff shifts were altered to provide increased oversight of vulnerable aisles, and security measures intensified — including installation of additional CCTV and electronic article surveillance.  

Correspondence from the Middlesbrough Retail Support Network, a voluntary group supporting shopkeepers, highlights the strain placed on small businesses, many already grappling with post-pandemic economic recovery and rising insurance premiums. Their representatives commend the police for their proactivity but stress that persistent offending undermines community safety perceptions as much as financial bottom lines.  

The court is mindful of the important role played by organizations such as the Retail Support Network in providing victim liaison services and advocating for retailer interests. Their balanced and principled approach deserves recognition, addressing harms honestly without escalating alarm.

In addition, a letter submitted by an outreach worker from HopePath, a local charity specialising in assisting individuals with substance misuse and housing instability, provides perspective on your circumstances. The letter describes your history of intermittent engagement with support services, including brief attendance at a community-based addiction recovery programme, although long-term adherence was not sustained. HopePath staff commend your expressed intent to stabilise your lifestyle but note the ongoing challenges posed by episodes of homelessness and occasional drug relapse. They advocate for intensive case management post-sentence to support reintegration.

The psychiatric evaluation commissioned on your behalf was undertaken by Dr Emelia Foster, consultant forensic psychiatrist. Her comprehensive report dated 18 August 2025 concludes that while you do not meet criteria for a primary psychotic disorder or major affective illness, there is evidence of a borderline personality disorder with marked impulsivity and emotional dysregulation. Dr Foster notes that these traits contribute to your risk profile for acquisitive offending. The report recommends that any custodial sentence be accompanied by structured mental health interventions, ideally within a residential rehabilitation setting.  

Although Dr Foster’s observations are medically sound and professionally presented, they do not, in principle, preclude custodial sanctions given the nature of the offences and your personal history. The court accepts that mental health factors should be considered sympathetically but balanced against the principles of deterrence, punishment, and community protection.  

Several recent cases provide helpful jurisprudential context. In R v. Bate [2024] EWCA Crim 825, the appellant, diagnosed with borderline personality traits and a history of substance misuse, was sentenced to 18 months’ custody for repeated thefts from supermarkets. The Court of Appeal emphasised that clinical vulnerabilities, although relevant to sentencing, do not in themselves eradicate culpability or diminish the need for public protection. Similarly, in R v. Kajani [2023] EWCA Crim 594, the court upheld a nine-month sentence for repetition of shoplifting, despite the defendant’s significant engagement with community psychiatric services.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Turning to recent probation service correspondence, probation officers highlight systemic challenges in supervision workloads and resourcing. The increased demand arising from low-level acquisitive offenders, many with complex psychosocial needs, strains an already overstretched system. Reports indicate that probation teams managing caseloads in the Cleveland area have average projections exceeding recommended limits, resulting in reduced capacity for intensive engagement.  

Given these limitations, the court underscores the importance of a tailored pre-sentence report that evaluates not only your criminogenic needs but also practical arrangements for effective rehabilitation within available service parameters. Any proposed community-based sentence must be supported by a credible plan demonstrating realistic prospects for compliance, which probation should assess rigorously.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

From a historical perspective, it is prudent to recall the judgment in R v. Thomas [2017] EWCA Crim 1058, where the Court of Appeal upheld a lengthy custodial sentence for repeated theft and criminal damage, noting the cumulative impact on victims and community morale. Although the present case does not involve damage or violence, the Court’s approach to repeated acquisitive offending remains relevant, particularly regarding the weight given to deterrence and denunciation.  

To elucidate further, the court recognises that sentencing guidelines intend to balance the competing aims of punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and the protection of the public. This fluid balancing act is invariably complicated by the specifics of individual cases—particularly where vulnerability and hardship are present alongside deliberate and sustained offending.  

It is, regrettably, a frequent feature of such cases that defendants delay admission of guilt, often well into the pre-trial or trial window, thus diminishing the potential for significant reduction in sentence credit. A plea entered at the eleventh hour—while mitigating to a degree—cannot be equated with early acceptance of responsibility, as was debated by the Court of Appeal in R v. Galloway [2022] EWCA Crim 1014.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Finally, it is relevant to note, tangentially, the challenges faced by ancillary public services in the region. The local mental health trust reports waiting times for adult psychiatric assessment exceeding 12 weeks in many cases. Housing services operate under substantial demand, with temporary accommodation placements stretched thin. Such systemic factors are beyond the court’s remit to resolve but form the backdrop against which individual offending and rehabilitation occur.  

The courtroom itself, recently refurbished at significant public expense, remains a marker of commitment to maintaining procedural dignity and public confidence. The court thanks ushers and court clerks for their unwavering professionalism in managing the often-overburdened list and logistical demands inherent in cases of this nature.  

It is recognised that shoplifting, while sometimes dismissed by the public as victimless, inflicts genuine harm upon individuals and communities—both tangible and intangible. The staff at the affected stores in Middlesbrough and Redcar have endured stress, altered routines, and diminished feelings of safety. These effects aggregate, undermining community resilience in subtle yet consequential ways.  

Sentencing will be adjourned pending receipt of a pre-sentence report prepared by the Probation Service, which is to include an updated assessment of your personal circumstances, risk of reoffending, and suggestions for constructive interventions. The report should evaluate the feasibility of a rehabilitative community order incorporating cognitive behavioural programmes, mental health support, and any suitable activity requirements. Consideration may also be given to alcohol and drug treatment provisions and housing stability.  

I reserve for that hearing the question of whether immediate custody or suspended sentence is appropriate, guided, as always, by the principle of proportionality. The probation report will be instrumental in assisting this court to identify the sentencing disposition most aligned with the goals of justice, rehabilitation, and public protection.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2025, in Court 4 at Middlesbrough Crown Court. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be submitted to the appropriate authorities. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days of sentence under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply in this matter. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
