IN THE CROWN COURT AT BIRMINGHAM  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/08647  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. D. Sylvester  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you are before this court for sentence in respect of a charge relating to theft by shoplifting pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending for which you have been convicted is understood to have occurred intermittently over a period beginning in late 2023 through to April 2025, primarily within retail environments situated in the Birmingham metropolitan area. The charge before the court constitutes a representative count, indicting a pattern of conduct rather than an isolated act.

Procedural History  
Your case followed the usual procedural pathway for offences of this nature, having been initially commenced in the Magistrates’ Court at Solihull before the Crown Court transfer protocol was engaged on 2 May 2025. You first appeared in the magistrates’ jurisdiction on 17 May 2025, at which point bail conditions were set, primarily designed to secure your attendance and prevent reoffending. Subsequent to preliminary hearings, the Better Case Management (BCM) framework was engaged with a pre-trial review held on 25 August 2025. It was noted at that time that disclosure from the prosecution was substantially complete, and the defence had raised issues regarding the timing and adequacy of Legal Aid provision to instruct appropriate expert evidence, in particular a forensic mental health assessment.  

The court is, regrettably, well acquainted with recurrent delays emanating from the current administrative burdens imposed within the Legal Aid Agency. In this instance, a formal request for funding to obtain a neuropsychological evaluation was submitted on 7 July but approvals were delayed until late August, occasioning adjournments and a fracturing of the otherwise predictable timetable. Such hindrances are troublesome, for they not only inconvenience the parties but risk undermining confidence in due process, particularly when the accused's liberty and future hang in the balance. I note with appreciation the patience exhibited by all counsel and parties despite these avoidable obstacles.

Your case was listed for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 30 September 2025, during which you entered a guilty plea on the touchstone count. No application for plea credit was advanced beyond the usual discount offered for an early plea; defence counsel candidly acknowledged that the timing of your admission was relatively late in the proceedings. This court, consistent with established jurisprudence such as R v. Mohamed [2018] EWCA Crim 1083, must treat plea credit as reflective not only of the entry of the plea but also its timing, sincerity, and effect on case management.

The court takes this opportunity to thank Ms Helena Fawcett, who appears on behalf of the Crown, and Mr Peter Mahoney of Counsel, instructed on your behalf, for their comprehensive and measured submissions in this matter. Both have conducted themselves with commendable professionalism, reflecting well on the administration of justice.

It is appropriate here to reference, with respect, the judgment in R v. Connolly [2023] EWCA Crim 755, which considered the scope of sentencing discount in cases involving repeated acquisitive crime where defendants initially deny offending but ultimately plead guilty following a robust evidential case. The Court of Appeal reiterated that a plea tendered only at the eve of trial affords limited mitigation, in recognition of the wasted judicial and prosecutorial time and the distress occasioned to witnesses.

Furthermore, in the light of sentencing principles as encapsulated within the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences, the central yardstick for determining an appropriate sentence remains the assessment of culpability, harm, and the defendant’s mitigation. The guidelines underscore the aggravating impact of persistence, targeting of vulnerable premises, and failure to engage with previous diversionary measures.

It bears noting that the broader context of acquisitive crime in recent years has seen not only a rise in reported offences but a concomitant strain upon policing resources. The West Midlands Police have documented a marked increase in retail theft incidents across Birmingham city centre, with seizures of stolen property frequently linked to complex networks engaged in resale or barter, though the present case involves no such trafficking allegation.

In some respects, this case exemplifies the ongoing tension between the costs imposed on the public purse by low-level crime and the social challenges that underpin the phenomenon, including economic deprivation, housing precarity, and the proliferation of unregulated second-hand markets. However, the court must remind itself that underlying social issues, while relevant to sentencing, cannot excuse repeated breaches of the criminal law.

It is perhaps worth remarking on the continuing success and limitations of the Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARAC) process across the West Midlands, which, albeit primarily designed to address domestic risks, has adapted protocols to engage with repeat acquisitive offenders where vulnerability and community risk intersect. Notwithstanding these innovations, systemic pressures impede thorough case management, particularly given chronic staffing shortages.

Against that background, and before rehearsing the facts as proffered by the Crown, I take judicial note of the fact that your conviction comes at a time when judicial resources are again stretched, with recent industrial action necessitating a compressed sitting pattern within Birmingham Crown Court. The physical refurbishment of Courtroom 4, where today’s hearing takes place, has modernised facilities, though delay remains a lamentable constant.

The support offered to retail victims by organisations such as Retail Safer Streets West Midlands merits commendation. Their collaboration with law enforcement and local authority teams has improved intelligence sharing and proactive deterrence. Correspondence from a representative of this group praises honesty and openness shown by victim witnesses here, describing their resilience as “a testament to community spirit amidst adversity.”

A referral to probation services has been requested to obtain a detailed pre-sentence report. I am grateful to Ms Agnes Wilkinson of the West Midlands Probation Trust, who has already made preliminary contact and supplied a summary of circumstances indicating some underlying social instability. The formal report will be awaited with interest, given the necessity of crafting an individually tailored sentencing disposition that balances rehabilitation with community protection.

While not dispositive in this matter, the court has reviewed a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Gordon Peel, consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 10 September 2025. Dr Peel notes the absence of formal mental illness but remarks upon traits of impulsivity and a background of adverse childhood experiences, including early exposure to parental substance misuse. His considered opinion is that community-based rehabilitative measures with appropriate support might reduce risk of recidivism. I thank Dr Peel for the detailed narrative and careful analysis. Such clinical insights assist greatly in the court’s assessment though do not displace the central statutory and guideline requirements.

A comprehensive review of case law pertaining to sentencing in theft offences includes consideration of R v. Longstaff [2016] EWCA Crim 129, in which the Court underscored the need to approach sentencing with an appreciation of cumulative harm caused by prolonged offending even where each individual act appears minor. Longstaff remains a touchstone in acquiring proportionate measures.

Turning now to the prosecution’s narrative: while the volume of documentation and CCTV analysis is considerable, the conduct described before the court can be summarised as a predetermined, structured pattern of concealment, evasion, and exploitation of retailer vulnerabilities.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

It is observed that the thefts were distributed geographically across multiple outlets, with evident adaptation in methodology over time. This suggests a strategic dimension, which contrasts starkly with any claim of casual opportunism.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

Several employees have provided statements detailing their subjective sense of insecurity and vigilance. Such testimonies exemplify the real-world impact of serial shoplifting on frontline staff morale and retention, a point emphasised in the victim liaison letters circulated in advance of this hearing.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

This form of offending, while lacking overt violence, cannot be minimised given its cumulative effect on public and retail confidence. It is well documented that persistent theft diminishes quality of life in affected neighbourhoods and contributes indirectly to price inflation and insurance premium rises.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

Representations from Social Care Services, while tangential, have been received, detailing historical fluctuations in your accommodation status. These submissions highlight the challenges experienced by local authorities in providing stable housing, particularly for individuals with complex social and behavioural needs.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

The court notes with sympathy the difficulties implicit in such unstable living conditions but reiterates that criminal behaviour remains subject to sanction irrespective of environmental stressors.

Three previous shoplifting convictions are recorded on your criminal history, all dating between 2017 and 2023. The probation file chronicles your prior engagement with community resolution and a conditional discharge, each intended as opportunities to curtail reoffending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

Notably, the evidence before this court indicates a waning of compliance with court-ordered obligations in the interceding months preceding this latest prosecution.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

The behavioural patterns evince a reluctance or inability to desist, a factor which weighs heavily in considering whether a sentence of immediate custody or a structured community order is most appropriate.

On the issue of ancillary matters, I reference a recent case, R v. Elam [2024] EWCA Crim 1329, involving possession of a bladed article in a school premises car park. Though factually unrelated, Elam insightfully explored the principle that even charges arising in different factual contexts may inform the general tenor of decisions on offender management strategies. Such cases demonstrate the range of complexity modern courts must confront.

Similarly, mention may be made of R v. Adams [2022] EWCA Crim 2120 where a co-defendant, unrelated to this case, was found to have breached a noise abatement order imposed on residential premises. That episode serves as a salutary cautionary tale about the cumulative effect of seemingly minor community nuisance offences contributing to local tensions.

With respect to rehabilitation services, the court recognises the strained capacity of local probation providers. Caseloads often exceed optimal ratios, and Covid-related backlogs continue to impede timely interventions. The West Midlands Office of Public Health has recently reported that waiting times for mental health support average 16 weeks. This is a complicating factor in addressing the roots of acquisitive offending but one which does not mitigate responsibility.

Similarly, the court notes the increasing reliance by voluntary agencies on charitable fundraising to maintain outreach programmes. While such efforts are applaudable, they underscore the fragility of the statutory safety net and the need for sustainable resource allocation.

The evidence also includes a letter from the defendant’s sister, Mrs Marjorie H., expressing concern regarding your current social isolation and lack of engagement with support networks. Her heartfelt appeal, while moving, cannot substitute for demonstrable behavioural change.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

Your defence team stresses your age, the absence of violence, and your expressed willingness to undertake rehabilitation programmes as mitigating features. They emphasise your current unemployed status, noting that you have recently been accepted for a vocational training course scheduled to begin shortly after sentencing.

Although these factors are relevant to mitigation, the court must remain mindful of public protection imperatives. The balancing act between promoting rehabilitation and ensuring accountability is rarely simple.

The evidence speaks to a degree of planning and persistence which is incompatible with trivialisation of your offending. Cases such as R v. Petrov [2021] EWCA Crim 998 serve as cautionary precedents concerning repeated offences of theft from multiple premises, where the Court upheld custodial sentences in recognition of the cumulative breach of trust and social contract.

Turning to risk assessment, the probation service has provisionally categorized you as presenting a moderate level of risk of reoffending, particularly in relation to acquisitive behaviour but with no indication of violent tendencies. Dr Peel’s clinical observations align with this, suggesting that engagement with cognitive behavioural therapy focusing on impulse control and financial management may be productive.

It must be noted, however, that despite availability, you have not previously demonstrated sustained engagement with support services. This reticence can be symptomatic of underlying factors yet is not uncommonly observed in persistent offenders who default to familiar, if self-defeating, behavioural patterns.

In light of the foregoing, a full pre-sentence report is essential. It should include consideration of your compliance history, social circumstances, and willingness to participate in rehabilitative schemes, including possible unpaid work, mental health support, and literacy assistance, as well as the feasibility of a community order incorporating such elements.

The court acknowledges that custodial sentences carry substantial personal and societal costs. They may disrupt family relationships, employment prospects, and social stability. Nonetheless, where persistent offending undermines public confidence and causes real harm, the imposition of immediate custody must be considered an option.

Finally, I remind counsel and all involved parties of the importance of confidentiality and dignity in the publication of court proceedings. The relative absence of media presence today reflects the limited public attention such crimes garner, notwithstanding the significant impacts on individual victims and community security. Open justice requires balancing transparency with proportionality.

Sentencing will be adjourned pending receipt of the pre-sentence report, due within four weeks. This will enable the court to consider all relevant information, including any further representations from prosecution or defence, before pronouncing a determinate or community-based sentence.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, the 14 October 2025, in Court 4 at the Crown Court at Birmingham. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.  

These are the orders of the court.
