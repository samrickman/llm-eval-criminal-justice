IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/04821  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. S. FLETCHER  
Filed: 18 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in connection with multiple incidents of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. These offences are said to have been committed intermittently over an 18-month period in various commercial areas within Greater Manchester, primarily involving small to medium-sized businesses. The charge before the court represents a pattern of behaviour rather than discrete episodic acts.

Procedural History  
You were arrested on 12 June 2025, following an investigation by the Manchester Economic Crime Unit and the Greater Manchester Business Crime Reduction Team, which had been monitoring a series of reported thefts over the preceding months. Initial enquiries revealed a proliferation of low-level thefts concentrated in convenience stores, newsagents, and small pharmacies situated near public transport hubs. The offences, as alleged, involved a similar modus operandi characterised by the opportunistic removal of goods during periods in which staff were engaged or distracted.

The sheer volume of incidents within a relatively confined geographical area prompted collaboration between multiple agencies, including local neighbourhood policing teams, the newly formed Northern Retail Safety Initiative, and CCTV monitoring units. The multi-agency task force examined reports encompassing both Greater Manchester Police records and municipal licensing data for shops affected by repeated loss. Their coordination exemplified the principles underpinning the Better Case Management (BCM) framework as laid down in the Criminal Procedure Rules, seeking to expedite case progression through early evidence collation and witness preparation.

Listing and pre-trial conferences proceeded with some delay, attributable largely to difficulties in securing appropriate legal representation and the ongoing administrative challenges faced by the Legal Aid Agency in this jurisdiction. Defence counsel was eventually instructed on 20 July 2025 following a protracted application for funding, which was complicated by shifting evidential requirements and the need for specialised expert reports.

The BCM protocol was applied in this matter with reasonable effectiveness. Early listing of the plea and trial preparation hearing occurred on 31 July, at which point you entered a not guilty plea. A trial was set for October 2025 but was vacated by consent on 25 August to facilitate further evidential enquiries by the defence, particularly relating to the admissibility of CCTV footage and witness statements. The matter was relisted for this sentencing hearing following your eventual plea of guilty entered on 1 September 2025.

Credit for your guilty plea is necessarily tempered by its timing. The jurisprudence, including R v. Havers [2022] EWCA Crim 1602 and R v. McKinnon [2021] EWCA Crim 2145, confirms the court’s discretion in awarding reductions based not solely on the plea’s presence but on its timing and the consequential saving of public resources and victim distress.

It is useful, if somewhat tangential, to note that this court is presently engaged during a period of significant strain on judicial and frontline policing resources, exacerbated by industrial action affecting court reporting services and budgetary restrictions imposed on investigative units specialising in economic crime. Such contextual factors, while not determinative, serve as a backdrop for understanding the operational pressures faced by agencies tasked with addressing acquisitive offences.

Recent discourse surrounding the decline in general community cohesion and increasing levels of street-level antisocial behaviour further frames this case. The tendency toward casual disregard for private property rights, whether borne of economic hardship or social despondency, is a phenomenon documented in various locality-based studies. However, the court is mindful to avoid succumbing to sociological generalisation in its legal determinations, focusing instead on the particulars and merits of each case.

The victim impact in acquisitive crimes, although often described as “symbolic,” carries substantive weight here. Local shopkeepers and staff have furnished detailed statements, revealing the eroding sense of safety and community trust engendered by repeated thefts. The economic loss is accompanied by psychological harm not to be underestimated.

Several letters of support, including one from the Salford Community Outreach Project, have been received, emphasising both your personal difficulties and the challenges faced by service providers operating amid chronic underfunding and rising demand. The court recognises the valuable work of these voluntary organisations, many of whom balance conflicting duties of care and accountability within resource-constrained environments.

It warrants mention, without particular direct application here, that recent appellate decisions have underscored the nuanced approach required where mental health issues intersect with criminal conduct. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the Court affirmed the necessity for sentence calibration when serious psychiatric conditions inform offending. While Mr Mallory’s offending involved arson and posed elevated public safety risks, the principles concerning therapeutic necessity versus custodial risk containment remain instructive in cases involving behavioural and cognitive vulnerabilities.

Equally, the court recalls the judgments in R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412 and the guidance therein about balancing clinical intervention and secure supervision — albeit in contexts of escalated harm. Though no analogous mental health claims have been advanced in your case, such jurisprudence forms part of the broader sentencing landscape.

There has been no suggestion of co-defendant involvement here, though the court is cognisant of cases proximate in time and geography where those charged with offences ranging from fly-tipping on protected greenbelt land to possession of bladed articles at secondary school car parks have encountered the criminal justice process. None of those matters bear upon your circumstances but provide a reminder of the diverse range of offences managed within the lower legal tiers and their often complex procedural path.

At the case management hearing on 20 July, multiple applications were made relating to disclosure and the admissibility of electronically stored evidence. Despite these procedural complexities, the court appreciates the diligence of both prosecution and defence in navigating the challenges presented by rapidly evolving digital evidentiary standards. The use of body-worn camera footage, for example, has introduced new dimensions of transparency and, occasionally, evidential contention in retail theft prosecutions.

Of some concern — although peripheral to your case — have been reports regarding the conduct of certain probation officers, including an ongoing investigation into allegations of corruption within the Manchester Probation Service. While this investigation has generated headlines and institutional introspection, it has had no demonstrable effect on the supervision or assessment of defendants charged with acquisitive offences within the current judicial circuit.

The court also acknowledges the recent refurbishment of Court 5, where this hearing takes place. The updated facilities, including improved accessibility and enhanced digital recording equipment, reflect institutional commitment to providing a modern, dignified forum for justice. Staff here continue to demonstrate professionalism and dedication in the administration of complex cases, notwithstanding heavy caseloads and periodic staffing shortages caused by vacation periods and illness.

Throughout these proceedings, the Crown has been represented with commendable efficiency by Ms Eve Stanton, whose submissions have been thorough and professionally balanced. Defence counsel, Mr George Keane, instructed under a Legal Aid order, has likewise advanced measured representations, demonstrating concern for your welfare alongside advocacy.

The facts of the offending reveal a pattern of calculated conduct. Surveillance footage portrays repeated entries into retail premises characterised by a deliberate yet covert removal of items, often concealed within personal belongings or clothing. The selection of goods suggests a familiarity with market demand and resale value, indicating a level of premeditation beyond opportunistic theft.

It is noteworthy that some incidents took place during busy periods or shift changes, suggesting an awareness of reduced oversight. Several store staff have provided statements describing heightened anxiety and a sense of vulnerability during your presence. While no threats or violence were reported, the emotional toll on employees cannot be discounted.

The court has received a series of victim impact statements collected through the Manchester Retailers Alliance, detailing adverse effects on business turnover, increased insurance premiums, and the imposition of additional security measures—costs invariably borne by small businesses operating on narrow margins.

In certain episodes, your conduct included bypassing electronic security tags by removal or tampering, methods requiring specific knowledge and equipment. This degree of sophistication further distinguishes your offending from mere impulsive acts.

Amidst these pertinent facts, the court notes the receipt of correspondence from the Manchester Homelessness Action Group. Their submissions, while supportive in tone regarding your social circumstances, emphasise the growing incidence of street homelessness and its attendant risks, including exposure to exploitation and mental ill-health. These contextual matters often underpin the lived realities of defendants with acquisitive crime convictions, though direct causation is rarely straightforward.

Earlier attempts at diversion via community resolutions and conditional cautions were undertaken. Their limited efficacy is regrettable but not unexpected given the evidence presented.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Psychiatric assessment from Dr Helen Fitzgerald, a consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed by the defence, concludes that while no major diagnostic criteria for a psychotic or mood disorder are met, there are clinically significant features indicative of underlying anxiety disorder and intermittent substance misuse. Dr Fitzgerald recommends engagement with psychological therapies focused on impulse control and stress management, noting that these interventions could assist in addressing some contributory factors.

Regrettably, you have demonstrated inconsistent engagement with such services to date. While the availability of NHS-funded mental health and addiction support in Greater Manchester is well-documented, lengthy waiting lists and resource shortages pose considerable barriers for many in need. This systemic pressure is a broader concern for public health but does not absolve individual accountability.

The scope and scale of psycho-social support services have become ever more constrained following prolonged fiscal austerity. The Mental Health Foundation’s 2024 report highlighted that waiting times for adult psychological therapies in the North West exceed national averages by 25%, with particular difficulties in accessing crisis intervention teams. These realities, although relevant, frame rather than excuse your position.

The Probation Service has produced a comprehensive pre-sentence report, which notes your previous convictions for shoplifting spanning back several years, most recently dealt with by a conditional discharge two years ago. The report identifies medium risk of reoffending and low risk of serious harm. Recommendations include referral to accredited offending behaviour programmes, particularly those focusing on acquisitive crime, alongside financial management advice.

The report points out that housing instability and lack of sustained employment are significant risk factors in your profile, echoing widespread social challenges faced by many individuals in similar circumstances. It emphasises the importance of multi-agency cooperation to support rehabilitation and public protection.

In the present sentencing context, it is necessary to consider section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, governing the imposition of community orders with rehabilitation activity requirements, unpaid work, or custodial sentences where appropriate. Case law including R v. Norbury [2020] EWCA Crim 1021 has reiterated the need to balance punishment and rehabilitation, especially where the defendant’s personal circumstances militate against custodial measures, unless public protection demands otherwise.

The court again acknowledges the observations in R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029 with regard to the timing of guilty pleas and sentencing mitigation. While your plea was not immediate, it nevertheless spares the court and witnesses from the rigours of a full contested trial.

That said, the persistent nature of your offending and failure to desist following prior interventions weighs heavily. The cumulative impact on victims and the broader community must be taken seriously, as emphasised in the Theft Offences Sentencing Guideline (Sentencing Council, 2021).

Sentencing decisions in such cases are inevitably influenced by the broader public interest in deterrence and maintaining confidence in the retail sector, particularly as small and independent shops increasingly cite retail crime as a significant threat to viability.

I record my gratitude to the Manchester Retail Crime Unit, Salford Business Safe Partnership, and other agencies whose collaborative efforts have been instrumental in assembling the prosecution case and supporting victim welfare.

In closing, I remind all parties that the court operates on principles of proportionality and fairness, and that sentences must reflect both the gravity of the offending and the prospects for rehabilitation.

I reserve final sentencing pending the receipt of any further reports or representations which may be submitted within seven days. In the meantime, the Probation Service is requested to consider the suitability and likely efficacy of accredited programmes, structured resettlement support, and tailored interventions addressing financial and psychological vulnerabilities.

You are reminded of your right to appeal from any custodial sentence imposed, subject to statutory provisions.
