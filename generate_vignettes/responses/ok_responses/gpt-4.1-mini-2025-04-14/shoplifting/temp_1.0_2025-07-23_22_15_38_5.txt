IN THE CROWN COURT AT ROTHERHAM  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14309  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M.J. Conroy  
Filed: 18 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for offences under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, specifically involving shoplifting from multiple retail premises across the South Yorkshire area. The offending spans a protracted period, commencing in the final quarter of 2023 and continuing into the spring of 2025. This court recognises the underlying seriousness of such conduct, given both its frequency and the cumulative impact upon shop employees, business proprietors, and, more broadly, community morale.  

Before addressing the facts of your offending and the relevant sentencing framework, it is pertinent to record the procedural genesis of this matter. Your initial arrest was effected on 1 April 2025 by officers from the South Yorkshire Police Retail Crime Unit, following an extended investigation that engaged not only local policing resources but also involved input from Rotherham Borough Council's Business Crime Reduction Partnership and regional specialist crime analysts. Intelligence suggested a pattern of thefts characterised by consistent modus operandi and temporal clustering, focusing on food stores and high street chemists within a defined radius.  

Such investigations, while by no means unusual in current practice, illustrate the significant resource allocation that acquisitive crime, even at relatively low individual value, demands from law enforcement. It is well documented that retail theft offences impose a disproportionate administrative and operational burden, necessitating hours of recording review, witness liaison, and evidential collation. The Rotherham operation reflected these known burdens. 

Indeed, as noted in a recent Home Office study on retail crime, these offences absorb frontline policing effort that could otherwise support the investigation of more serious crimes, underscoring the systemic impact of persistent shoplifting on public protection models.  

At the outset, the court must acknowledge the support provided by the Rotherham Business Crime Reduction Partnership. Their facilitative role in collating stores’ loss data, compiling CCTV evidence, and assisting victim liaison has undoubtedly advanced the prosecution’s cause. This is aligned with the protocol established under the Multi-Agency Business Crime Strategy 2023, which aims to create streamlined responses to such repeat offending patterns. The court is conscious, however, that notwithstanding clear policy frameworks, substantive application often relies heavily upon the commitment of operational staff confronting chronic capacity constraints across policing and local government bodies alike.  

It is no secret that the Legal Aid Agency’s processes have, regrettably, occasioned delay in this case. The defence’s initial application for funding to instruct a clinical forensic psychologist was submitted promptly after arraignment but faced protracted adjudication. Several rounds of correspondence addressed questions concerning scope and cost estimates before approval was granted only in early September 2025. This delay inevitably postponed timely assessment and risk evaluation, reflecting persistent systemic difficulties within legal aid administration which continue to attract judicial criticism, both locally and nationally.  

The case proceeded through the Better Case Management (BCM) pathway, with hearings held on 14 May and 29 July 2025. The July listing included a plea and trial preparation hearing, at which you entered a not guilty plea, later changed to guilty on 15 September 2025 following the provision of further evidence including witness statements and forensic linkage. 

There is nothing novel in the pattern of delayed guilty pleas in offences such as shoplifting, a phenomenon recorded and analysed in recent case law and judicial reviews. For instance, the Court of Appeal in R v. Cassim [2023] EWCA Crim 637 reaffirmed that credit for a guilty plea should correspond proportionately to its timing and the consequent saving to the court and witnesses. Late pleas, particularly those tendered shortly before trial, attract reduced mitigation.  

It is against this contextual backdrop that I proceed to consider the circumstances of your offending.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

Your offending involved multiple incidents across a range of retail venues, marked by methods aimed at evasion—such as concealing items within clothing and utilising distraction techniques to divide staff attention. Such tactics evidence a degree of premeditation inconsistent with occasional lapse, instead reflecting sustained and targeted behaviour. 

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

A number of those premises were operated by small independent traders, some part of consortia backing local charity initiatives. The impact of your repeated conduct extended beyond direct financial loss; statements from shop managers describe increased anxiety, staff turnover, and in several cases the reduction of opening hours due to perceived risk. Localised neighbourhood cohesion suffers where trusted commercial spaces are disrupted by ongoing offending.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

While violence or threats were absent, it cannot be ignored that the emotional toll on employees arguably exceeds that attributable solely to the value of stolen goods. This court takes note of the Crown Prosecution Service’s published An Acquisitive Crime Strategy for England and Wales (2024) which reaffirms the need to address victim impact actively and meaningfully when structuring sentences for theft offences.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

Regrettably, it appears you have previously been subject to community resolutions and conditional cautions for like conduct, with little long-term effect. That, coupled with your failure to engage with voluntary sector support organisations—despite multiple attempted referrals—raises serious concerns regarding your attitude to compliance and rehabilitation.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

In this regard, the report prepared by Probation Officer Ms Sarah Linton, dated 9 October 2025, is instructive. While comprehensive, it underscores your current disengagement from services addressing financial instability and substance misuse, and highlights neurocognitive considerations including impulsivity and limited executive functioning capacity. Ms Linton prudently notes the absence of severe mental illness but points to the importance of targeted interventions to address criminogenic needs.  

The NHS Trust’s psychiatric addendum, prepared by Dr Anthony Mukherjee, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 11 October 2025, offers corroboration in these respects. The report explains that your behavioural profile aligns with features often encountered in cases of chronic acquisitive offending, shaped partly by socioeconomic factors but also by deficits in self-regulation. Importantly, while comorbidities such as substance dependence were assessed, no psychotic or major mood disorder was identified. The report recommends cognitive behavioural therapy and structured community supervision incorporating rehabilitative activity requirements.  

It is important to place these clinical assessments in NHS context. Mental health services in South Yorkshire, as elsewhere, face substantial pressures, reflected in extended waiting lists for secondary care psychological therapies. The resource limitations inevitably complicate timely access to specialist interventions, a factor considered in sentencing deliberations and community supervision planning alike.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

This court is increasingly aware of the strain under which such support services operate: overcrowded caseloads, funding shortfalls, staffing turnover, and the ripple effects of broader public health crises. Nevertheless, they remain indispensable pillars of offender rehabilitation strategies designed to balance risk reduction with opportunities for personal development.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Turning to the legal framework which governs sentencing for theft offences, the principal guide remains the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2021). This emphasises that sentence length and type should reflect deterrence, protection of the public, and the offender's culpability as well as mitigating factors. While the low financial value of goods may point to less severe penalties, aggravating factors such as repeat offending, victim impact, and prior warnings weigh heavily towards a custodial threshold in persistent cases.  

Consideration must also be given to the comprehensive revised principles set out in R v. Staddiscombe [2024] EWCA Crim 289, where the Court clarified that persistent acquisitive offending—though non-violent—may warrant immediate custody where community options have been tried and failed, and where the offender displays minimal engagement with available support.  

It is necessary to acknowledge that while you have pleaded guilty, the timing of your plea—well into the preparatory phase—reduces the extent of credit available to you. Your plea does, nevertheless, avoid the need for a contested hearing and reduces the burden on witnesses.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Before concluding, attention is drawn to the wider societal and procedural context. Across the nation, shop theft consistently accounts for a significant portion of police and court workload. The repeat nature of such offences exacerbates the pressure on already stretched service providers ranging from local authorities to voluntary organisations. For instance, the Rotherham Citizens Advice Bureau, which submitted a letter of representation dated 7 October 2025, describes increased presentations of financial crisis among clients entangled with the criminal justice system. These clients often oscillate between homelessness risk, addiction issues, and limited employment prospects, a cocktail that perpetuates offending cycles.  

On the matter of previous jurisprudence cited in submissions, the court reflects briefly on cases which, while unrelated in factual particulars, have contributed to shaping the sentencing approach to acquisitive crime. For example, R v. O’Dowd [2021] EWCA Crim 876—an appeal concerning theft from an out-of-town electronics retailer—reiterated that even thefts involving goods primarily of technological provenance carry weight beyond their monetary value by virtue of their role in facilitating organised crime networks through fencing operations. That case, while distant in context, underscores the differentiated impact of theft depending on the objects concerned.  

Similarly, R v. Baines [2019] EWCA Crim 1332, upheld a suspended sentence in the context of fly-tipping offences involving hazardous waste, noting that the public harm hydra has multiple heads. While environmental crimes—such as illegal dumping of asbestos or chemical by-products—are not pertinent here, they serve to remind us of the broad spectrum within which harm must be understood. Indeed, the court acknowledges that regulatory offences, even when technically administrative, can entail significant risk to public health and safety.  

Of tangential note, the plea on behalf of a co-defendant in a separate case, R v. Wilkinson [2024] EWCA Crim 1120, involved offences connected to affray and possession of offensive weapons at licensed premises. Such incidents, though bearing no connection to the present case, form part of the broader mosaic of criminality encountered in the community, and their separate treatment illustrates the importance of contextualising and not conflating individual responsibility within cases sharing procedural proximity.  

It is equally relevant to observe that a neighbour of yours, unrelated to you in any legal sense, currently faces domestic abuse allegations under case number T2025/14632. That matter remains in preliminary stages, unrelated to your circumstances save for the incidental proximity of addresses recorded in police files.  

Returning to immediate matters, I thank counsel on both sides for their thorough and measured submissions today. Ms Carlina Byrne, for the Crown, and Mr Anthony Kimble, representing you pursuant to a standard Legal Aid order, have conducted themselves with professionalism and courtesy despite procedural hurdles, particularly those attendant on securing expert evidence. Such professionalism should be lauded in an era where judicial business faces increasing demand and shrinking resources.  

Finally, I note the indispensable contributions of court staff, including our ushers and registry officers who have managed the recently refurbished courtroom 12A with admirable efficiency. The seamless conduct of these hearings here serves the interests of justice and public confidence alike.  

At this juncture, it is the practice of this court to reserve sentence pending receipt of a detailed pre-sentence report that will consider your current personal circumstances, the risk of reoffending, and appropriate rehabilitative interventions. That report will also address pertinent factors including your accommodation stability, employment history, and compliance with statutory supervision regimes.  

Until then, I cannot pronounce the precise nature or length of sentence but expressly direct that the probation service explore possibilities including community order options with accreditation, unpaid work, and therapeutic programmes targeting impulsivity and offending cognition. The role of structured support addressing housing insecurity and substance misuse, if present, is also to be considered.  

I remind you, Mr H, that the sentencing court’s paramount obligation remains the protection of the public and the delivery of justice in a proportionate and reflective manner.  

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 October 2025, in Court 12A at the Crown Court at Rotherham. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate authorities in due course. You are hereby advised of your right to appeal the sentence within 28 days as provided under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged in this instance. Any issue regarding costs is reserved for subsequent determination.  

These are the orders of the court.
