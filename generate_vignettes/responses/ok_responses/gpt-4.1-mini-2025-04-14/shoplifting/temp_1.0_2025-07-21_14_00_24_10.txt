IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHBANK  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14376  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L. GREAVES  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this Court having been found guilty of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending in question arose over the course of a protracted period from October 2022 through to February 2025, and involved multiple incidents within the Southbank and neighbouring boroughs.

Procedural History  
You were initially arrested on the 29th of February, 2025, as part of an intensive investigation conducted by the Southbank Metropolitan Police’s Acquisitive Crime Unit in collaboration with the Southbank Retail Safety Alliance. This alliance includes representatives from retail security teams, local licensing authorities, and the Crown Prosecution Service’s shop crime unit. The investigation was initiated following repeated reports from various retailers concerning suspicious activity and frequent losses allegedly linked to you, or a person matching your description.

Interagency cooperation, while lauded in principle, often struggles in practice. The Local Business Crime Prevention Partnership, operating under the wider banner of the Southbank Business Safety Board, has endeavoured to coordinate real-time information-sharing among retail establishments, but such systems are no cure-all. The degree to which participating retailers actively engage varies widely, with some larger chains investing heavily in loss prevention measures and others, notably smaller independent shops, lacking the resources to do more than report incidents sporadically. This disparity has regrettably hampered consistent intelligence-led responses across the borough—and is a pattern endemic to many urban centres facing constrained operating budgets.

Your case was listed for a Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing on 21 March 2025 after you entered an initial not guilty plea. Discovery included a voluminous evidential bundle comprising CCTV footage, staff statements, and forensic reports. Subsequent developments, including further video evidence and a detailed GIS analysis of shoplifting hotspots within the borough, culminated in the acceptance of a guilty plea on 19 August 2025. This late plea conforms to a familiar, and, one must say, unfortunate trend in retail theft matters—where defendants exercise their procedural rights to test the prosecution’s case until evidentiary certainty renders resistance futile.

The Court recognises the strain such delays place on judicial resources, retail victim-staff morale, and the wider community’s confidence in the criminal justice system. It must, however, be borne in mind that the availability of procedural protections is a cornerstone of due process, and that the ultimate duty of the Court is to ensure all decisions are informed by law and fact. The sentencing regime accordingly must balance the interests of justice and the legitimate mitigation that a plea of guilt may bring, mindful of public policy concerns as reflected in the relevant guidelines and case law.

The saga of this case is further complicated by regrettable delays in the processing of legal aid applications. Your solicitors made an early application in March 2025 for the funding to instruct a forensic psychologist experienced in behavioural assessments of repeat acquisitive offenders. The Legal Aid Agency’s protracted review process stretched over three months, during which time assessments and case preparation were necessarily dormant. Such systemic inefficiencies are well-documented in reports by the Criminal Bar Association and the Sentencing Council, with the resulting bottlenecks exerting adverse impacts on case timeliness, professional morale, and ultimately, the delivery of justice to defendants and victims alike.

Surrounding this delay was an unfortunate coincidence of court scheduling pressures, exacerbated by industrial action within court support services, resulting in the adjournment of several key procedural hearings. The Southbank Crown Court is currently managing a significant backlog of cases. While the involving parties have shown commendable diligence in meeting deadlines when permitted, the interconnectedness of administrative challenges cannot be overlooked. These procedural delays amplify the burden on all participants and underscore the increasing complexity and fragility of contemporary case management frameworks.

Strategic defence submissions emphasised your history of traumatic childhood experiences, including episodes of neglect and instability within the foster care system. These factors, while undoubtedly shaping your life-course, do not exempt you from accountability but are relevant to individualised sentencing, as recognised in R v. Sinclair [2023] EWCA Crim 1453, where the Court reaffirmed the importance of weighted mitigation reflecting personal history without diminishing culpability.

The Court is cognisant that the Public Health England’s 2024 report on the accessibility of mental health services cited significant gaps in community provision within the Southbank area, especially for adults aged 25 to 40, exacerbated by staff attrition and rising demand. This context is pertinent, as defence medical submissions suggest that your behaviour may be influenced by untreated anxiety and intermittent substance use disorder. Consultation with Dr Harriet O’Connell, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, included a review of your case, resulting in a detailed report appended to the pre-sentence documentation.

Dr O’Connell’s report describes you as presenting with symptoms indicative of moderate chronic anxiety disorder, compounded by periods of alcohol misuse, though without psychotic features or significant cognitive impairment. The report recommends structured engagement with community mental health teams but expresses reservations about the likelihood of sustained compliance, given your historical patterns of non-engagement. The probation officer’s assessment likewise reflects concerns regarding impulsivity and financial instability as persistent criminogenic factors.

This case unfolds against the backdrop of increasingly precarious housing markets. Your current residence is temporary, arranged through the Southbank Homelessness Prevention Service following an eviction prompted by rental arrears. The Service’s annual report highlights the systemic challenges facing families in housing need, notably rising waiting lists and the toll on social services. Your own interactions with the housing authority have been intermittent and at times fractious, complicating consistent support delivery.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

The multi-agency approach to retail crime, incorporating the Business Crime Reduction Partnership’s data-sharing protocol, has proven patchy. The partnership’s semi-annual audit in 2024 acknowledged persistent gaps in information flow, especially concerning smaller retailers who lack formal loss-prevention staff. Nonetheless, for the present case, store managers from two medium-sized retail chains provided detailed victim impact statements expressing significant disruption and staff anxiety resulting from your actions.

Of note, one victim impact statement from the manager of a local pharmacy records alterations to staff rotas and refusals to permit lone working during early morning shifts—a measure taken explicitly on account of fear arising from your repeated visits. This intangible harm reflects the broader psycho-social effects of your offending beyond mere financial loss.

The Court further acknowledges a written submission dated 12 August 2025 from the Southbank Retail Worker’s Support Network, a charitable organisation offering frontline assistance to employees affected by workplace crime and intimidation. Their commentary notes a national rise in workplace-related stress linked to acquisitive offending and advocates for greater resource allocation to victim support schemes.

In considering the sentencing framework applicable in this case, the Court is guided principally by the Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2020, amended 2023). The Guideline obliges sentencing courts to evaluate the culpability of the offender, the harm caused (both economic and personal), and any aggravating or mitigating factors.

Relevant aggravating factors here include the repeated and persistent nature of the offending, the targeting of vulnerable premises, the impact on staff wellbeing, and the failure to desist despite prior warnings and community disposals. Mitigation includes your plea of guilty, albeit late and following inevitable evidential pressure, your personal difficulties and unstable housing status, and the absence of any prior violent offending.

I have noted with interest the jurisprudence extrapolated from cases such as R v. McTavish [2022] EWCA Crim 1785, where it was emphasised that whilst pleas of guilty attract a discretionary discount, the timing and sincerity of such pleas are pivotal. Late pleas, delivered only when the weight of evidence can no longer be challenged, typically warrant more modest reduction. Mr McTavish’s case, which involved sustained repeated shoplifting offences across multiple stores, was considered instructive during these proceedings.

Similarly, the principle articulated in R v. Carney [2019] EWCA Crim 2021, concerning the cumulative harm arising from ongoing theft offences, bears relevance. In that case, the Court recognised that even low-value thefts, when part of an orchestrated pattern, produce disproportionate communal impact, meriting a proportionate custodial response.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

The evidence illustrates that on various occasions you employed a range of concealment tactics, ranging from the use of layered clothing to apparent distraction methods targeting staff attention. This calculated behaviour not only demonstrates heightened culpability but reinforces the premise that the offending was neither opportunistic nor impulsive, but carefully directed.

The Crown correctly submits that such conduct erodes the sense of safety and trust within retail environments, fostering a climate in which workers must remain perpetually vigilant, with attendant psychological costs. This Court accepts those submissions. The fact that no physical threats or violence occurred does not diminish the seriousness of this impact.

In parallel, records from the Southbank Social Services Department, included in documentary evidence, describe your prior engagement with youth outreach programmes and early interventions attempted during your teenage years. While not directly related to the instant offending, they provide useful background concerning your developmental history and social milieu.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

The Court has reviewed the probation officer’s comprehensive pre-sentence report dated 31 August 2025. The report highlights a complex profile, including histories of educational underachievement, interrupted employment, and multiple instances of non-compliance with community sentences for similar offences. It further indicates missed appointments with support programmes designed to reduce recidivism and improve life skills.

The report recommends consideration of a community order incorporating requirements tailored to address offending behaviour, mental health engagement, and potentially unpaid work. Given your housing status, the report also flags the need for liaison with local housing support services to mitigate immediate risk factors.

It must be stated, without hesitation, that short custodial sentences for offences of this nature have a limited rehabilitative effect and impose substantial costs on the wider community. Indeed, sentencing decisions are increasingly influenced by the imperative to deploy alternatives to custody where safely possible.

However, this must be balanced against the clear societal expectation that repeat offending, with demonstrable harm, is met with an appropriately robust deterrent—both to the individual and the public at large.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

Parallel to case management, the Court notes the voluntary sector contributions to the sentencing process. Letters received from the Southbank Community Outreach Project, a non-governmental organisation providing support to vulnerable adults, commend your belated engagement with their counselling services, while cautioning that progress remains fragile.

Such inputs are invaluable, speaking not only to your capacity for change but also to the resources that must be marshalled effectively to support sustainable desistance.

While commendations exist for these small steps, they do not yet ameliorate the seriousness of the offences and their repeated nature. The Court similarly notes, with regret, the prolonged waiting times currently experienced in accessing services through the Southbank Addiction Recovery Unit. The waiting lists for triage appointments often exceed six months, a factor outside your control but illustrating the resource constraints facing public health.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

I must also refer to the legislative context. The Theft Act 1968 has remained the keystone statute concerning property offences for over half a century, yet society’s understanding of acquisitive crime and its drivers has evolved markedly in that time. Parliamentary debates in 2023 on amendments to sentencing provisions sought to reflect this evolution, acknowledging the complex nexus of mental health, socio-economic factors, and community impact.

Notwithstanding these changes, the core principle remains clear: theft is a breach of trust and an affront to the communal fabric.

In this vein, R v. Faraday [2024] EWCA Crim 1238 reaffirmed the Court of Appeal’s stance that the criminal justice system must calibrate responses to theft carefully, applying custodial sentences sparingly where possible, but decisively where repeat offending with material harm is evident.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

Further to the specific matter of your case, the Court must register its concern that, despite previous interventions, including warnings and non-custodial disposals, offending continued unabated. This pattern diminishes the mitigating weight that might otherwise be accorded to factors such as social disadvantage or mental health difficulties.

That said, the Court remains mindful that protection of the public includes not merely retribution and deterrence, but the encouragement of rehabilitation and reintegration. The delicate balance between these imperatives will be central to the forthcoming sentencing determination.

It is necessary, in conclusion, to place on record the Court’s appreciation for the professional conduct displayed by all parties throughout these proceedings. Ms Lucy Grant, leading counsel for the Crown, presented the prosecution case with clarity and measured restraint. Mr Daniel Elms, representing the defence, provided diligent and conscientious advocacy despite the well-known pressures imposed by legal aid resourcing constraints.

The seamless order maintained by the court staff, combined with the dignified bearing of all those in attendance, reflects the enduring commitment of the judiciary and supporting personnel to the administration of justice under challenging conditions.

Sentencing will be adjourned pending receipt of an updated pre-sentence report incorporating any further medical or psychiatric evaluations and submissions from probation. The court requests that the Probation Service consider recommendations relating to potential community rehabilitation requirements, unpaid work, mental health support, and housing liaison.

These sentencing remarks are issued on this 14th day of September 2025 in Court 5 at Southbank Crown Court. Proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Criminal Procedure Rules Part 5. Mr H is advised of the right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. There are no reporting restrictions in force pursuant to section 49 Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
