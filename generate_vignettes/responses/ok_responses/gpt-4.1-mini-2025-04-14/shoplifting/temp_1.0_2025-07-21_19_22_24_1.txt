IN THE CROWN COURT AT MIDDLESBOROUGH  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/15347  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. P. NICHOLLS  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear today before this court for sentence in relation to the charge of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, representing a pattern of offending over an extended period in the district of Middlesborough and adjoining retail precincts. The offending conduct in question, as charged and now admitted, involves multiple incidents occurring between late 2023 and the early part of 2025, predominantly in small to medium-sized retailers specializing in pharmaceutical and personal care products.

Procedural History  
You were first arrested on 12 March 2025 after a targeted investigation by Greater Cleveland Police in collaboration with the Middlesborough Business Crime Liaison Unit. The investigation followed a crescendo of concern raised by local shopkeepers who, over several months, reported loss of stock not easily accountable by natural wastage or administrative error. The Middlesborough Retail Crime Partnership coordinated efforts to collate and analyse CCTV footage, inventory shrinkage reports, and staff accounts, leading to your identification as a suspect. 

The process of assembling the evidence was, as is often the case, fraught with logistical and administrative hurdles. Retailers volunteered their time and commercial data, which had to be juxtaposed with police intelligence that in some instances suffered from missing timestamps and overlapping video frames. The video imagery frequently displayed the defendant wearing hooded attire, obscuring facial features, or footage was compromised due to camera angle limitations. These challenges necessitated a painstaking, iterative review of hours of material accompanied by relevant expert statements prepared by crime scene specialists analysing point-of-sale discrepancies and security sensor disruptions. 

Early investigative efforts benefitted from a limited, though comprehensive, community policing operation deploying ‘plain clothes’ officers to observe and record typical patterns of footfall and suspected activity in the targeted retail areas. In parallel, a partnership was established with local volunteer organisations concerned with retail staff welfare and workplace safety, responding to the emotional toll on personnel repeatedly subjected to loss investigations and alarmingly frequent incidents of intimidation from recidivist individuals.

An initial interview under caution was conducted on 14 March 2025, during which you declined to admit guilt. Following forensic analysis of clothing seized from your residence—a dark green parka notably consistent with that worn in surveillance footage—corroborative evidence was assembled, enabling the Crown to proceed with charging you on 22 March 2025. The matter was then transferred to this Crown Court as part of the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme, with the objective of effecting an efficient progression to trial or plea.  

The BCM regime, introduced under the auspices of the Criminal Procedure Rules, is designed to expedite the handling of cases, reducing unnecessary delay and ensuring that evidential clarity is established at an early stage. The court acknowledges that in the present instance, despite typical pressures arising from court listing congestion and, notably, a short adjournment caused by procedural irregularities with service of prosecution disclosure, all parties endeavoured to adhere to timelines, culminating in the listing of a plea and trial preparation hearing on 22 May 2025. 

At that hearing, you entered a not guilty plea, but following receipt of further evidence and additional witness statements from shop managers, you changed your plea to guilty at the early stages of a trial listed for 5 June. It is appropriate at this juncture to reiterate the well-established judicial position concerning discounts for guilty pleas, as underscored in R v Bennett [2023] EWCA Crim 1203. The Court of Appeal reiterated therein that the utility and fairness of plea credit rest heavily upon timing and sincerity, with late pleas, particularly those entered after overwhelming evidence arises, meriting only limited reduction in sentence.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

While the facts of Bennett concerned a more serious fraud-related offence, the principle that the sentencing discretion is diminished by delayed admissions of guilt is equally applicable to theft offences such as this one. The court also draws reference to R v Penman [2022] EWCA Crim 978, where repeated minor acquisitive crimes committed over several months, coupled with an absence of prior engagement with rehabilitative services, led to a custodial sentence reflective of public protection needs. The cited authorities underscore the judiciary’s duty to ensure proportionate sentencing that balances punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, and community protection.

Turning to the broader context in which this conduct occurred, I find it necessary to record the immense strain on public services tasked with addressing such offences. The Probation Service for Cleveland reports chronic staffing shortages, with caseloads frequently exceeding recommended limits, thereby impeding robust supervision of low and medium-risk offenders. This systemic challenge is compounded by significant waiting lists in mental health services, notably the Psychological Therapies Access Pathway, which has seen a 30% increase in referrals over the past year, due in large part to pandemic-related backlogs and resource constraints. I have received a letter from the Head of Probation, Ms Fiona Melrose, emphasizing these constraints and the consequent impact on efforts to engage repeat acquisitive offenders in meaningful support.

Moreover, retail workers, many of whom are part-time employees with limited employment protections, have voiced persistent concerns over heightened anxiety and diminished morale caused by recurrent thefts, occasionally accompanied by verbal abuse. The Retail Staff Welfare Alliance, a voluntary sector organisation, has submitted representations outlining the emotional and psychological ramifications on employees, including instances of increased absenteeism and reluctance to work alone during closing hours. These factors, while not directly altering legal culpability, form an important backdrop to the impact of your conduct.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

This court is cognisant of the delicate balance between recognising the pressures individuals face and upholding the rule of law. Previous judicial pronouncements have acknowledged the multifactorial nature of criminal behaviour, but caution against conflating explanation with excuse. Indeed, as noted in R v Henderson [2019] EWCA Crim 583, societal and economic hardships, while relevant to mitigation, cannot absolve persistent opportunistic offending that undermines community cohesion.

I must also comment upon an unfortunate but recurrent operational concern: the delays occasioned by Legal Aid authority decisions. In this matter, applications to instruct a forensic psychiatrist experienced in impulsivity-related disorders took over six weeks to process, despite the time-sensitive nature of preparatory reports. Defence counsel, Mr Simon Cranley, drew the court’s attention to this issue, which regrettably contributed to adjournment of sentencing from the originally scheduled date of 29 July 2025 to today’s listing. The Legal Aid Agency’s slow response is emblematic of a broader systemic malaise. It is a matter the judiciary continues to monitor closely, mindful that access to expert evidence is fundamental to fair adjudication.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

To provide further context on the assessment of risk and potential for rehabilitation, I wish to summarise the conclusions reached in the psychiatric evaluation conducted by Dr Anita Fowles, consultant forensic psychiatrist. Dr Fowles notes an absence of any major mental disorder but reports traits consistent with impulsivity, dysfunctional coping mechanisms with respect to stress, and a mild history of alcohol misuse. The report highlights that your engagement with voluntary support systems has been minimal, despite repeated opportunities to participate in financial counselling and substance misuse programmes. Dr Fowles opines that this lack of engagement diminishes prospects for rehabilitation absent enforced intervention.

On a related note, the probation officer’s presentencing report observes that you have a history of residential instability, having experienced multiple interspersed periods of temporary accommodation and brief stays with friends. While the immediate cause of your offending appears linked to economic difficulty, your refusal to engage with debt management initiatives and inconsistent cooperation with probation appointments undermine the efficacy of community-based sentences. There is also documentation noting your failure to comply with an earlier community resolution following an incident in 2022, which may give rise to concerns about compliance and motivation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

The court has also been provided with victim impact statements from two local pharmacy managers and a small convenience store owner. These attest to significant disruption caused by your offending, including financial loss, the need to increase staff training on loss prevention, and a discernible reduction in staff confidence. One victim described heightened fears of confrontation and a palpable increase in workplace stress.

Mr Cranley, on your behalf, submitted a letter detailing your personal circumstances, including the pressure of caring for a dependent family member with a chronic health condition and the disruption caused by the breakdown of your previous accommodation arrangements. While such matters may inform mitigation, they do not diminish the seriousness of your decisions to repeatedly appropriate goods without payment.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

In reviewing the overall landscape of acquisitive offending in this jurisdiction, the court is mindful of recent statistical trends indicating a modest increase in shoplifting incidents over the past two years, exacerbated by post-pandemic economic pressures and inflationary cost-of-living rises. It is also noted that the regional Business Crime Crime Reduction Group has implemented a stage-based intervention scheme designed to flag repeat offenders earlier and link them to support, but resourcing gaps have limited its reach.

It may be instructive at this point to refer to the decision in R v Marlow [2020] EWCA Crim 541, where a sentence of twelve months’ custody was imposed for repeated thefts from retailer premises involving thefts of goods used in drug consumption paraphernalia. While your offending is not linked to illicit substances, the principles of assessing harm and the need for deterrence remain analogous.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Separate from your individual history, the court notes an unrelated case in which your co-defendant from a previous matter was convicted of affray during a street disturbance proximate to a community event. That conviction, while separate and not attributable to you, has nevertheless added complexity to the local policing operations and shed light on fragmented peer group influences. It further underlines the challenges authorities face in disentangling overlapping social and criminal networks.

In addition, the environmental context of some incidents bears noting. The premises targeted include two independent stores that had previously been the subject of local authority noise abatement orders due to activities unrelated to the offences with which you are charged. While these administrative actions have no bearing on your culpability, they illustrate the complexity of community environments where low-level crime and civil regulatory enforcement intersect.

Turning to previous case law, R v Collins [2018] EWCA Crim 2123 addressed possession of a bladed article in a school playground car park. While entirely distinct in subject and gravity, Collins highlights how the sentencing framework accommodates the presence or absence of aggravating factors such as potential for harm to vulnerable groups. This is reflective of sentencing principles that weigh the totality of circumstances rather than a narrow view of the predicate offence alone.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

In arriving at an appropriate sentence, the court observes the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline (effective from 2022), which categorises offending based on factors including the value of stolen goods, the level of premeditation, the presence of aggravating circumstances such as targeting vulnerable victims or repeat offending, and the offender’s criminal history. The guideline emphasises the importance of considering the impact on victims and on public confidence.

In your case, the frequency and deliberateness of the offending, the choice of relatively vulnerable retail premises, and the prior entreaties of the criminal justice system to desist cumulatively frame the offence as more serious than an isolated, one-off theft. Mitigating factors such as the late guilty plea and your stated personal difficulties are noted but must be balanced against public protection imperatives.

This court is grateful for the detailed input received from Crown Prosecutor Ms Nia Patel and defence counsel Mr Simon Cranley, whose submissions were courteous, professional, and thorough. I also acknowledge the presence of the court usher, Mr Andrew Bridges, whose management of court staff and administration ensured the smooth running of today’s hearing despite a brief delay in the arrival of the interpreter services.

Although this court operates within the Crown Court tier, pleasantly housed within the refurbished Middlesborough Justice Centre opened in 2019, space constraints continue to press on operational efficiency. Cases such as this, which require substantial evidential collation and expert involvement, remind us of the crucial role the Crown Court plays between the magistracy and the appellate courts in delivering proportionate justice.

In closing, I must reiterate the fundamental principle that while contextual realities and personal hardship inform judicial discretion, they do not provide immunity from lawful sanction where repeated criminality undermines social trust and the security of local communities.

Sentencing will be adjourned to allow for the preparation and consideration of a full pre-sentence report, which the probation service is instructed to compile. This report should particularly address the feasibility and appropriateness of community-based rehabilitative measures, including cognitive behavioural therapy tailored to acquisitive offending, engagement with financial advice services, and monitoring for potential substance dependency treatment pathways. The report shall also consider risk of reoffending and compliance prospects to inform any decision on custody versus a community order.

These sentencing remarks are made this 14th day of September 2025 in Court 6 at the Crown Court at Middlesborough. Proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal against sentence or conviction within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged herein. The question of costs is reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
