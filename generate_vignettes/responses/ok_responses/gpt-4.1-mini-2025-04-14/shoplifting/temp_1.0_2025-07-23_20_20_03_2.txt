IN THE CROWN COURT AT GREENWICH  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13849  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. M. FLETCHER  
Filed: 14 October 2025  

Mr H, you come before this court for sentencing in respect of a charge under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, relating to a course of shoplifting offences committed over an extended period across multiple retail premises in the Greenwich borough and adjoining areas. This court is acutely aware of the challenges posed by such offending, which, while often described colloquially as “low level” or “minor,” exerts a significant cumulative impact on individuals, businesses, and community confidence.

Procedural Background  
You were arrested on the 2nd of August, 2025, pursuant to a multi-faceted investigation conducted by the Greenwich Metropolitan Police Service’s Retail Crime Unit, supported by the Greenwich Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP). The investigation was predicated upon the collation and analysis of incident reports, CCTV recordings, and retail loss prevention intelligence spanning several months. As the court repeatedly observes with some consternation, the detection and prosecution of retail theft requires a disproportionately rigorous assembly of evidence, given the typically modest value of individual items and the resource-intensive nature of gathering admissible material. 

It bears mention that the Better Case Management (BCM) system, implemented nationally to streamline Crown Court proceedings, provided the procedural framework for the preparation of this case. The aim - to reduce duplication and facilitate earlier resolution - has met with variable success across jurisdictions, yet in this instance the listing and progression timetable was adhered to with reasonable punctuality. The plea and trial preparation hearing was convened on 10 September 2025, following the service of the prosecution evidence bundle. Legal Aid representation was secured on behalf of the defendant, albeit with delay. I wish to acknowledge the efforts of counsel, Ms Sarah Bannister of the Crown Prosecution Service, and Mr Oliver Simmonds, instructed by Legal Aid to represent Mr H, for their professional conduct throughout these proceedings.

It is regrettable, however, that securing legal aid funding to commission a forensic behavioural assessment proved protracted. The application was first submitted on 4 September and, after a series of exchanges and requests for further documentation, was only authorised under considerable duress on 29 September. This delay unhelpfully deferred expert evaluation until the days immediately preceding the sentencing hearing. Such administrative inertia from the Legal Aid Agency remains an ongoing concern within the legal profession and undermines the principles of timely and fair justice.

The courts are frequently called upon to adjudicate cases where defendants enter guilty pleas at a late stage, sometimes at the door of trial. The rationale for such last-minute admissions varies, but the effect is consistent: lost opportunities for early resolution, heightened burdens on witness preparation, and erosion of resources. The Court of Appeal has emphatically confirmed that credit for a guilty plea is a matter of judicial discretion conditioned by timing and sincerity, as summarily articulated in R v. Edmonds [2022] EWCA Crim 875.

Earlier pleas attract significantly greater credit, reflecting both the defendant’s acceptance of responsibility and the benefits to the administration of justice. Conversely, pleas entered only after the crown’s case has become effectively unanswerable merit a more restricted discount, as set forth in R v. Hodgson [2019] EWCA Crim 688, where the appellate court underscored that a plea made merely to avert a trial cannot be equated with genuine remorse.

Further consideration must be given to the interplay of sentencing principles established in leading authorities such as R v. Woods [2017] EWCA Crim 1851, which dealt with repeat acquisitive offenders, and R v. Terrell [2021] EWCA Crim 1003, which considered the impact of pre-existing personal hardship on sentencing outcomes. Heeding these precedents, this court is mindful of the delicate balance between deterrence, public protection, rehabilitation, and the acknowledgment of individual mitigation factors.

In the realm of public safety, it is regrettably necessary to observe the increasing volume of acquisitive crime markers within urban settings, spanning petty thefts through more serious patterns of shoplifting, which cumulatively impair the operational viability of local businesses. Retail workers, often underpaid and overstretched, bear a disproportionate share of the burden in recovery efforts and personal safety concerns. The courts must, therefore, demonstrate both principled firmness and tempered discretion in responding to such offences.

Further contextualising this case, it is useful to note that the Greater London Authority’s 2024 Retail Crime Annual Report identifies a 12% increase in shoplifting incidents across south-east London boroughs, with a particular uptick in cases involving repeat offenders employing distraction tactics and concealment strategies. The report underscores the strain even “minor” thefts place on policing capacity, loss prevention teams, and community reassurance efforts.

This initial description of offending conduct is supplemented by submissions on behalf of both prosecution and defence, which draw upon a range of evidence from witness statements to reviewed CCTV footage. Police and business investigators reported that the defendant’s actions exhibited a degree of planning and repeat targeting of vulnerable outlets rather than spontaneous acts of petty theft.

It must also be considered that the economic climate, post-pandemic, continues to exert pressure on public and private sectors alike. Inflationary increases, labour shortages, and supply chain disruptions, while beyond the immediate control of individuals before the court, nonetheless provide socio-economic background which may bear on personal circumstances but do not excuse criminal behaviour.

The court regrets that this matter was not resolved more expeditiously. The delay was compounded by the uneven availability of victim impact material. The Greenwich Retailers Association kindly provided statements outlining the burden of repeated theft on operational costings and workforce morale. The statements describe the implementation of additional security measures, the reduction of staff hours, and the psychological toll on retail employees—factors seldom visible in the financial summaries but deeply felt in daily working life.

Turning to clinical assessments, the psychiatric evaluation conducted by Dr Helen Sharpe, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, on 5 October 2025 was both extensive and instructive. Dr Sharpe’s report carefully delineates the absence of overt psychiatric pathology, while noting the presence of mild depressive symptoms and traits indicative of impulsivity and stress-related coping difficulties. The assessment advises the court that these factors may partially shape behavioural patterns but do not constitute a mental disorder sufficiently severe to mitigate criminal responsibility in this context.

The findings caution against simplistic readings of vulnerability. It remains incumbent upon defendants to engage constructively with available support structures, and for the justice system to maintain calibrated responses that balance rehabilitative need with public protection imperatives.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.

As regards historical cases of acquisitive crime informing sentencing, the court recalls R v. Bannister [2018] EWCA Crim 1932, where the defendant was convicted of serial shoplifting involving aggravating factors such as use of false identification and timing offences around shift changes to evade detection. Although the factual matrix differs, the principles articulated in Bannister concerning offender culpability and sentence proportionality remain persuasive.

This case counselled caution against community sentences in absence of demonstrable engagement.

Another instructive precedent is R v. Coleman [2020] EWCA Crim 2410, which concerned a defendant repeatedly found in possession of controlled substances and small-value stolen goods. Coleman demonstrated the necessity of integrating custodial measures with multiagency intervention, particularly where offending patterns intersected with substance misuse and housing instability. Although Mr H’s situation is not analogous in every respect, the court recognises the complexities that attend offending underpinned by social and health vulnerabilities.

The court also notes the contributions of the Greenwich Mental Health Outreach Service, which submitted a report commenting on the challenges faced by individuals exhibiting low-level substance dependency alongside mental health difficulties, in contexts of economic hardship and insecure housing. Their staff commendably highlighted the current scarcity of resources and long waiting times for psychological therapies, a systemic issue regrettably impacting many who find themselves at the margins of care provision.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

The case management process here was subject to the usual vicissitudes, including delay occasioned by industrial action affecting court listing and minor scheduling conflicts owing to the unavailability of certain prosecuting witnesses. While these matters frustrated timely adjudication, they are, regrettably, not uncommon in present-day court programming.  

This court is aware that the strain on criminal justice resources has increased markedly in recent years, with police forces contending with greater demand from volume crime investigations, counter-terrorism priorities, and community policing functions. The additional administrative requirements flowing from multi-agency data protection compliance and procedural safeguards similarly add to processing times.  

These factors form part of the institutional landscape against which this case must be judged, though they do not alter the substantive issues of culpability and risk.  

Additionally, it may be of peripheral interest, though legally immaterial here, to mention the unrelated proceedings involving Mr H’s former flatmate, who is currently under investigation for alleged cannabis cultivation on the premises opposite the victim store on Brookside Road. Those matters proceeded independently and bear no direct relation to the defendant’s admitted offences.  

Equally, it is noted that a co-defendant charged in a separate but linked prosecution relating to aggravated burglary of a warehouse unit in Surrey remains at large since absconding following refusal of bail in April 2025. That individual has no connection to Mr H beyond minimal acquaintance and is not implicated in the instant case.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

This court acknowledges correspondence received from the community charity Haven Wellbeing, which operates in the Greenwich borough and supports individuals addressing substance misuse and mental health challenges. Their letter confirmed intention to offer post-sentence engagement with Mr H, subject to his participation. This voluntary sector involvement is a welcome, if not determinative, aspect of this case.

Sentencing Framework  
The offence falls squarely within the scope of the Theft Act 1968, section 1. The Sentencing Council’s guideline on theft offences published in 2019 remains authoritative and directs the court to consider factors including the value and nature of the property stolen, the sophistication of the offender’s conduct, harm caused to victims, and personal mitigation.

The guidelines identify specific aggravating features pertinent here: repeated offending, targeting of vulnerable premises, use of accomplices or planned concealment methods, and failure to show remorse or engage with interventions.

Conversely, available mitigation includes early guilty plea - subject to timing - personal circumstances, and demonstrable steps towards rehabilitation.

The court treats with caution references to socio-economic adversity as mitigation in the absence of concrete evidence of engagement with support measures. Repeated failure to respond positively to offers of help will influence sentencing outcome adversely.

The court recognises that immediate custody is not invariably appropriate for offences involving low-value theft, but must weigh the need for denunciation, deterrence, and public protection against prospects for community-based rehabilitation.

The probation service will be required to consider these competing factors in their pre-sentence report, including risk assessments, offender motivation, and suitability for structured interventions such as accredited thinking skills programmes and financial management courses.

Conclusion  
On the basis of the material before me, and subject to the forthcoming pre-sentence report, I am minded to reserve sentence. This will allow a fuller assessment of risk, circumstances, and appropriate community measures, if any, alongside custodial options.

The court reiterates its appreciation for the professionalism displayed by all parties, including court staff who have navigated the logistical complexities occasioned by recent refurbishment of court facilities and intermittent staffing shortages.

This sentencing hearing has been conducted in open court, with all affected parties present. The record of these remarks will be transcribed in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.

You are advised, Mr H, of your right to appeal within 28 days of sentencing pursuant to the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged.

Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
