IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/14796  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. M. FLETCHER  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before the court today for sentence following your conviction on a representative charge relating to shoplifting offences, committed over an 18-month period within the Bristol North and Bishopston areas. The charge is brought under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, and concerns a pattern of dishonesty directed at retail premises ranging from independent grocery stores to larger high street chain outlets. The formal proceedings have been conducted with scrupulous adherence to the Criminal Procedure Rules and the Better Case Management (BCM) framework established to efficiently manage such cases.

It is, sadly, an increasingly familiar scenario for this court to address the rise of repeat theft offences impacting the retail sector. The recent report from the British Retail Consortium notes a sustained increase in retail shrinkage, citing theft as a leading contributor. While technological advances, including CCTV and electronic article surveillance (EAS) systems, have improved loss prevention, the sheer volume and perennial nature of shoplifting cannot be overstated. Instances of repeat offending impose considerable operational burdens on police, retailers, and the wider criminal justice system alike. They also have a profound albeit sometimes overlooked impact on staff well-being and community confidence. 

The Better Case Management regime was designed, among other purposes, to contain these systemic pressures by progressing cases with greater expedition and clarity. Within this framework, your legal representatives and the Crown have cooperated commendably to advance this matter, notwithstanding some noted hurdles. Those hurdles include delays occasioned by difficulties in authorising funding for expert reports through the Legal Aid Agency, which mirror, all too frequently, the systemic under-resourcing affecting this vital service. Such delays hinder not only case preparation but also the fair and timely administration of justice, and it is right to record this court’s ongoing concern about these endemic difficulties.

Your initial appearance before the magistrates’ court on 3 February 2025 was delayed beyond the usual statutory timeframes due to staffing shortages compounded by national court strike action—factors entirely outside your control but illustrative of the broader strains on the criminal justice system. The original listing for plea and case management was consequently adjourned, and this court, in its discretion, has sought to mitigate undue prejudice arising from these external events. Nonetheless, it remains incumbent upon the defendant and defence counsel to engage with the process diligently.

At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 15 July 2025, you entered a late guilty plea to the representative count. It is appropriate to remind you and all concerned that credit for an admission of guilt flows principally from an early acceptance of responsibility which materially aids the administration of justice. As reiterated in cases such as R v. Halvorsen [2023] EWCA Crim 1029, the lateness of a plea inherently diminishes the discount available. That ruling, whilst factually concerning arson offences, nonetheless articulates a broadly applicable principle: tactical timing does not equate to contrition. Your plea was entered only after the accumulation of compelling CCTV evidence, witness statements, and prosecution disclosure that rendered denial unviable at trial. Consequently, the court’s credit for your guilty plea will be moderated accordingly.

The issue of credit is one facet of sentencing. Equally relevant are the circumstances surrounding the offending, your personal mitigation, and the impact on victims and the community. This court is conscious of the challenges faced by individuals in precarious housing and employment, as well as the effect on those who labour daily in retail environments subject to persistent theft. 

It is germane at this juncture to note the interventions of local voluntary sector bodies who have provided both support and victim impact statements in this case. The Bristol Retail Support Network, for instance, submitted detailed representations outlining the detrimental effect of repeated shoplifting on community shops and their employees. Such groups operate under chronic funding constraints yet maintain vigilance against escalating acquisitive crime. Their input is invaluable in illuminating the lived realities behind often faceless statistics.

From the outset, it is clear that the offending was not spontaneous nor isolated but conducted with apparent deliberation and planning. Your use of specific tactics to avoid detection implicates a more sophisticated approach to gain maximisation than might be found in a one-off lapse of judgment.

The operational context likewise merits commentary. The case involved extensive collaboration between the Bristol Safer Streets team, the Metropolitan Retail Crime Unit, and local store detectives. Indeed, one cannot underestimate the multi-agency coordination required to compile the evidence base on which this prosecution was premised. The publicly funded analytical work conducted to link your actions across different venues illustrates the heavy investment that such investigations demand.

Your personal circumstances have been well-documented in pre-sentence and psychiatric reports. Notably, the clinical psychologist’s assessment by Dr. Matthew Ibbetson — submitted pursuant to the defence application for expert input — provides a nuanced view of your psychological profile. Dr. Ibbetson’s report, dated 12 August 2025, identifies traits consistent with intermittent explosive disorder and moderate anxiety, potentially influencing impulsivity though falling short of a full psychiatric diagnosis. This is significant insofar as it may bear upon treatment needs and risk management, but it does not absolve personal responsibility for your conduct.

In passing, it is necessary to record that decisions in reported appellate authorities hint at the parameters of psychiatric input relevant to theft offences. For example, R v Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, while factually involving arson committed in psychosis, establishes that psychiatric conditions do not preclude custody when public safety is paramount. This is echoed by R v Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412, which underscores the primacy of community protection even where mental health factors exist.

The court also notes that your engagement with available community support has been sporadic and mostly reactive. Outreach from organisations such as Bristol Housing Aid has been met with inconsistent cooperation. These agencies operate under immense strain, given escalating demand for emergency accommodation amidst a national housing crisis. It bears reminding that, while systemic failures contribute to individual hardship, voluntary and statutory bodies deserve some recognition for the resilience they exhibit amid such adversity.

The current evaluation includes consideration of your prior offending history. Your record indicates several prior convictions for similar offences, including a conditional caution issued in 2023. This repetition is concerning, particularly when viewed in light of multiple diversionary opportunities extended by police and probation services, all apparently without sustained behavioural change. I remind you that persistent acquisitive offending chips away at public confidence and diverts resources from more serious investigations.

This court’s sentencing approach is informed by overarching policy as articulated in the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences Guideline (2021). The guideline emphasises the need to balance individual circumstances with harm caused, public protection, and deterrence. Relevant aggravating factors include offending against vulnerable premises, abusing positions of trust, or operating within a pattern of repeated theft.

Similarly, mitigating factors tend to cluster around genuine evidence of remorse, early pleas, and demonstrable steps towards rehabilitation or engagement with support services. Your position is complicated by your delayed plea and the evident recurrence of offending following prior warning.

The Crown has made representations drawing attention to the impact on staff morale and commercial loss. Victim personal statements, submitted through the Bristol Retail Crime Partnership, testify to observable stress among employees, some of whom have experienced anxiety requiring adjustment to work patterns. Though your conduct involved no violence or threats, the ripple effects extend beyond direct financial loss.

In parallel, the probation service has produced a thorough report examining your overall risk and need profile. The report, dated 30 August 2025 and authored by Probation Officer Ms. Clare Downing, concludes that you pose a moderate risk of harm and a high likelihood of reoffending absent targeted intervention. The assessment recommends consideration of cognitive skills training, financial management courses, and close supervision via community orders.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

It is important to observe that advice from probation underscores the relevance of an integrated approach encompassing psychological support and practical assistance in relation to daily living. Whilst not relevant to the immediate question of sentence severity, it places an essential emphasis on addressing root causes of offending behaviour rather than solely imposing punitive measures. The court should not lose sight of this broader rehabilitative aim.

You are currently 34 years of age. The records reflect no affiliation with organised crime or gangs. There is no indication of coercion or exploitation in connection with these offences. Your family situation is described as complex but without immediate protective considerations.

The court is conscious that the administration of justice frequently occurs within a dynamic tension between public protection and individual rights, between punishment and rehabilitation. The unfortunate reality is that the persistent commission of offences such as these incrementally erodes the social fabric and the confidence of local businesses. It risks fostering a climate in which victims and witnesses are reluctant to engage with the legal process, fearing futility or escalation.

The NCCPS’s recent strategic report flags this risk explicitly, noting the cumulative impact of acquisitive offending on community cohesion. Such considerations, albeit intangible, must not be discounted amidst the formal sentencing calculus.

Of equal importance is the court’s continued concern over the operational pressures bearing on agencies engaged in this sphere. The local police units assigned to business crime investigations report a growing caseload, exacerbated by limitations in staffing and support infrastructure. The Bristol Safer Streets initiative, while successful in some respects, cannot substitute for fundamental investment.

Furthermore, the court acknowledges that while Legal Aid funding was eventually sanctioned to facilitate the commissioning of the psychiatric report, substantial delays were incurred. These delays, lamentably, reflect a persistent and systemic issue within the Legal Aid Agency’s administration, hindering timely access to expert assessments critical to fair trial preparation and sentencing.

Having considered all relevant factors, including the gravity and persistence of your offending, the available mitigating circumstances, and the public interest, I make no immediate order at this moment. Instead, I direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report to explore and recommend the most suitable sentencing pathway that balances retributive and rehabilitative aims, with due regard to public protection.

Such a report should include an assessment of suitability for community orders incorporating rehabilitation activity requirements, unpaid work, and any mental health interventions considered clinically appropriate. In the event the report determines that community disposal is unsuitable, I reserve the option of custodial sentencing.

These sentencing remarks are pronounced this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Bristol. The proceedings have been formally recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. A transcript of these remarks will be appended to the court record. You are advised of your statutory right to appeal this sentencing decision within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply unless otherwise ordered. Costs remain reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
