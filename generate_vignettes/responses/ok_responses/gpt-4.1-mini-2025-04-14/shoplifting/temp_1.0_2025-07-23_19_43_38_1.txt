IN THE CROWN COURT AT WINDSOR  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. K2025/04678  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. W. Mansfield  
Filed: 16 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction on a representative charge of theft, specifically shoplifting, in contravention of section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending is said to constitute a course of conduct extending over a significant period in 2024 and 2025, targeting various well-known retail premises within the royal borough of Windsor and nearby localities. The factual matrix before the court demonstrates a systematic pattern of acquisitive offending, with attendant disruption and consequence to the businesses and individuals affected.

Procedural History  
Your initial appearance was before Windsor Magistrates’ Court on 3 May 2025. The Crown Prosecution Service elected to commit the case for trial given the complexity and scale of the allegations. Listed initially for an early first hearing at Windsor Crown Court on 14 June 2025, the matter was subject to some delay, partly attributable to availability issues within the public defence office and later exacerbated by staff shortages in the court list caused by industrial action at the Royal Courts of Justice in London during July. These industrial actions, albeit unrelated to this case, illustrate one ongoing challenge faced by the judiciary and legal profession in managing caseloads in times of resource constraint.  
Notwithstanding such external factors, it is important to acknowledge that the overall progression of the case adhered largely to the framework envisaged under the Better Case Management Protocol (BCM), which provides a structured procedural timetable designed to facilitate expedition and early resolution where possible. The BCM initiative, now well established, aims to co-ordinate court listings, evidence disclosure, and pre-trial issues so as to avoid unnecessary delay and duplication of effort.

On 14 June, a Plea and Case Management Hearing was held. At that juncture, you entered not guilty pleas to the charges, and the case was listed for trial originally fixed for 20 September 2025. In the intervening months, there were further defence applications for additional disclosure including CCTV footage and retail staff statements, which were duly provided. The trial was ultimately rendered unnecessary by your late guilty plea at the afternoon session on 15 October 2025, which was accepted by the Crown. Whilst all pleas are received properly by the court, it is a noted and regrettable feature of many acquisitive crime cases that guilty pleas are frequently entered late—often proximate to trial or once the weight of evidence becomes overwhelming.

It is the court’s duty to remind parties that credit for a guilty plea is not a mechanistic entitlement fixed to the fact of admission but is instead a reflection of the timing of the plea and the extent to which it spares witnesses the trauma of contested proceedings and conserves public resources. In R v. McLeod [2023] EWCA Crim 1854, the Court of Appeal reiterated that full credit is reserved for pleas entered at the first reasonable opportunity, typically at the first hearing. Pleas entered once an evidential case is effectively unassailable attract significantly reduced discount.

This case similarly demonstrates the prudence of that principle. The timing of your admission, on the eve of trial, cannot pass without consequence.

The court notes that, in addition to the more immediate impact on retail businesses, shoplifting and other forms of acquisitive offending represent a substantial burden on law enforcement and judicial resources. Police officers regularly tasked with following up such matters are diverted from investigations of more serious and violent crimes, stretching already thin service capacities. This is underscored by data from the Thames Valley Police Department’s 2024 annual report, which highlights that 28% of recorded acquisitive crimes require investigative input but yield limited detection rates, often owing to suspect mobility and difficulties establishing proof beyond reasonable doubt.

Moreover, the administrative burden upon the Crown Prosecution Service is substantial. Disclosure packages in cases of this nature often run into multiple thousands of pages, encompassing CCTV footage, inventory logs, witness statements, and forensic reports. This places pressure not only on prosecution teams but also on defence representatives and the judiciary. It is in no one’s interest for cases to be protracted unnecessarily, yet the cumulative circumstances of disclosure, forensic examination, and legal advice inherently require due process to be respected.

The defendant’s right to effective representation is paramount but can be frustrated by procedural delays, particularly when applications for expert reports or psychiatric assessments depend on authorisations from the Legal Aid Agency. Unfortunately, as this court remarked in a recent sentencing of Rees [2025] EWCCR 422, the approval processes for instructing independent clinical experts have become increasingly labyrinthine, prone to delays that hinder timely case management. In this instance, the defence’s requests for forensic psychological evaluation were initially refused pending clarification of funding criteria, delaying access by over four weeks. The court reiterates the pressing need for streamlining these processes to avoid compounding the burdens of already stretched public resources.

Against this background, it remains appropriate for this sentencing exercise to balance the considerations of justice for victims, efficient administration of the courts, and the rehabilitation prospects of the offender.

Diversionary and rehabilitation initiatives have become a cornerstone of modern sentencing frameworks for acquisitive offending, recognizing that many such offences stem from complex social and psychological factors. The Sentencing Council’s guidelines for theft offences, last updated in 2020, highlight the importance of addressing underlying causes such as addiction, mental health difficulties, or socio-economic hardship, which may contribute to offending behaviour.

The Probation Service’s pre-sentence report, prepared by Officer Grace Pennington, is detailed and professionally prepared, but does not recommend immediate custodial disposal given the circumstances. It confirms the defendant’s current unemployment and acknowledges housing instability arising from recent eviction from council-provided temporary accommodation. The report observes Mr H exhibits limited engagement with voluntary support services and a pronounced reluctance to participate in structured rehabilitation programmes—an issue which undoubtedly informs risk assessment for reoffending.

The psychiatric report authored by Dr Philip Stannard, consultant forensic psychiatrist, is cautious but thorough in its analysis. Dr Stannard records no diagnosis of major mental disorder such as schizophrenia or bipolar affective state. However, he notes sub-clinical symptoms of anxiety and depressive affect alongside a tendency to impulsivity and poor frustration tolerance. His suggestion that these psychological vulnerabilities contribute to behaviour disinhibition is consistent with wider clinical understanding of acquisitive offending in vulnerable adult populations.

In the matter of statutory sentencing principles, the court remains bound to consider public protection, the seriousness of the offence, deterrence, and rehabilitation in accordance with section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and relevant pronouncements such as the judgment of Lord Woolf in Attorney-General’s Reference (No 5 of 2002) [2003] UKHL 68.

However, prior to entering substantive consideration of sentence, it is pertinent to review the factual backbone underlying your conviction.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

It is worth noting that your offending was not confined to random impulse thefts but bore hallmarks of calculation. CCTV footage and store records indicate repeated use of decoys and diversionary tactics, including simulated mobile phone conversations and deliberate selection of moments when staff were otherwise engaged. Such conduct evinces a disturbing and repetitive disregard for social norms and the law, amplified by the fact that you continued offending despite prior warnings and a series of community resolutions placed on record.  
This is reminiscent, in some respects, of behaviours condemned in R v. Conway [2024] EWCA Crim 342 where repeat acquisitive offenders employing distraction techniques received custodial sentences reflecting both recidivism and degree of planning. It is a salutary example of the court’s approach towards deliberate breach of trust and manipulation inherent in such offending.

While the general public may conceive of shoplifting as a victimless crime, the reality is starkly different. The individuals affected—the shopkeepers, staff, and local business owners—suffer financial loss, increased security costs, and often heightened anxiety. Employees recount feelings of vulnerability and reduced morale. For those working alone or unsupervised, there is a tangible fear of confrontation or escalation. The economic impact can also result in reduced store hours, job losses, or even permanent closure of small businesses, with wider social consequences for communities.

The Business Crime Reduction Partnership for Windsor provided a report to this court, reflecting on the cumulative impact of repeated retail theft. Their submission speaks of a gradual erosion of local market vibrancy and the added pressures on police patrol resources. It touches on the challenge faced by small and independent operators, many with limited capacity to invest in loss prevention technologies or additional staffing.

A witness statement from Ms Denise O’Leary, manager at one affected premises, was read earlier today. She described a cycle of harm extending beyond immediate theft: the cost of replacing stock, the non-monetary toll on staff confidence, and the continuing challenge of deterring repeat offenders.

The court acknowledges the efforts made by the Community Safety Partnership in Windsor to implement crime prevention initiatives, including work with retailers and local enforcement agencies. Their successful introduction of “ShopSafe” schemes has achieved some positive results, yet the persistence of offending in this case underscores ongoing challenges.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

Reference must also be made to co-ordination between agencies in handling investigatory and victim support work. Local police officers, despite the strains on front-line resources, have maintained engagement with affected businesses, keeping them advised and providing reassurance. The engagement of the Neighbourhood Policing Team is commendable, notwithstanding the upward pressures on demand caused by seasonal fluctuations and broader social unrest.

Separately, it is noteworthy that a business located within Eaton Gardens was subjected to arson damage in March 2025 during a dispute unrelated to this case. Although irrelevant to Mr H’s offending, the incident further compounded the challenges experienced by local retailers in the period preceding your arrest.

Mr H, you were arrested on 24 July 2025 following a coordinated operation by Windsor Borough Police, utilising intelligence-led surveillance and corroborative evidence gathering. Your movements were monitored using an amalgam of CCTV networks, passenger transit card usage records, and digital forensics on a mobile device seized during your apprehension. The operation, while successful, demanded extensive deployment of officers and analysts over weeks.

It bears repeating that such resource-intensive investigations, though sometimes targeting what might be described superficially as “minor” crimes, nevertheless represent significant public expenditure. Given the competing demands faced by police forces nationally—from organised crime groups to violent offences—policing acquisitive crime remains a delicate allocation of scarce resource.

The court regrets, however, that delays at various administrative interfaces meant that the forensic psychological evaluation, pivotal to sentencing considerations, was obtained only weeks after your referral—constrained by Legal Aid procedural requirements and the availability of appropriately qualified practitioners. Such systemic issues were generously highlighted in the Ministry of Justice’s recent review of legal aid for criminal defence experts.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.

Continuing with legal context, the Theft Act 1968 section 1 remains the seminal instrument for offences of dishonesty. The threshold for conviction rests on demonstrating appropriation with intent permanently to deprive, combined with dishonesty as defined by the Ghosh test—later supplanted in part by Ivey v Genting Casinos [2017] UKSC 67, refining the objective standard of dishonesty.

Sentencing for theft offences is calibrated according to the harm and culpability. The Sentencing Council’s Definitive Guideline on Theft Offences (2020) provides a structured approach, considering factors such as the value of the stolen goods, the degree of premeditation, and the effect on victims.

Recent appellate authority also reiterates that the repetition of offending is itself an aggravating factor, reinforcing public interest in proportional custodial penalties as deterrence.

Of note is R v. Winters [2025] EWCA Crim 510, involving a defendant who committed multiple shop thefts over a two-year period and who demonstrated a calculated modus operandi. There, a sentence of 14 months’ immediate custody was endorsed on appeal, with the court emphasising the need to deter similar patterns of acquisitive offending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Further, it is important to acknowledge that sentencing must be individualised and proportionate, reflecting not only the offence but also the defendant’s personal circumstances, including previous convictions, potential for rehabilitation, and engagement with supportive measures.

Probation input also suggests a degree of guarded optimism that, with enhanced engagement and a structured rehabilitative framework, the risk of reoffending can be reduced, mitigating longer-term harm.

It is the court’s intention, therefore, to impose a sentence reflective of both the seriousness of persistent shoplifting and the potential for constructive intervention. Pre-sentence reports will be critical in shaping this approach.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

In closing, I convey my thanks to Ms Amina Zayed appearing for the Crown, whose submissions were measured and focused, and to Mr Eliot Frank, solicitor advocate for the defence, whose client care and diligence are evident notwithstanding the tensions inherent in such cases. Credit is given for the guilty plea, albeit entered late, thereby preserving public resources and sparing witnesses the rigours of contested trial.

I must nonetheless record dissatisfaction with the persistent delays encountered in obtaining funding for expert reports and the impact of external factors such as labour disputes affecting court listings. While not solely attributable to any party, these elements exacerbate the strain on the justice system and underscore the need for reform.

This sentencing hearing is conducted in open court, consistent with principles of transparency and public accountability enshrined in the Criminal Procedure Rules.

I shall therefore adjourn for a short period to receive a pre-sentence report, directed to encompass a full assessment of risk, amenability to rehabilitation programmes—particularly those targeting acquisitive offending behaviour—and considerations relating to your personal circumstances and support network.

Once the report is received, the court will re-convene to pronounce sentence with due regard to all relevant information.

These are the sentencing remarks of His Honour Judge L. W. Mansfield, delivered in Court 5 at Windsor Crown Court on 16 October 2025. The transcript is recorded under the provisions of Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You, Mr H, are reminded of your right to appeal against sentence within 28 days pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
