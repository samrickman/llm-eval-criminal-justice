IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. MR H  
Case No. M2025/13877  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge P. G. WINTERBOTTAM  
Filed: 15 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentencing on a charge related to dishonesty by way of shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending conduct spans multiple occasions over the past 18 months within various retail establishments in the Greater Manchester area. This court is tasked with determining an appropriate sentence, balancing the needs of justice, public protection, and your rehabilitation.

Procedural History and Case Management  
The case was initiated following your arrest on 12 June 2025, subsequent to a series of intelligence-led operations conducted jointly by Greater Manchester Police and local retail security teams forming part of the Manchester Business Crime Alliance. These partnerships routinely collate and analyse data from multiple stores, aiming to identify repeat offenders and patterns of acquisitive crime. The endeavour is reflective of ongoing efforts to curtail retail theft, a form of offending that, while often proximate in harm, entails considerable cumulative impact upon affected businesses, employees, and broader community confidence.  
It bears mentioning that the Business Crime Alliance, although geographically limited, functions within a mosaic of wider regional and national partnerships, including cross-boundary information sharing platforms and the National Retail Crime Intelligence Hub. The complexity of these networks underscores the resources and administrative effort dedicated to responding to what, in isolation, might appear minor infractions. Yet, it is precisely the aggregation of such incidents that catalyses concerted enforcement action.  
Your initial appearance was scheduled before the Manchester Magistrates’ Court on 19 June 2025, at which you entered a not guilty plea. Proceedings were subsequently committed to this Crown Court jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, owing to the volume and nature of evidence disclosed, as well as the potential for a custodial sentence.  
The defendants’ legal representation shifted mid-way, resulting in a short adjournment on 4 August 2025 to permit familiarisation with case documents and facilitate the securing of expert reports. Of significance, the initial Defence solicitor withdrew citing a conflict arising from a concurrent civil matter, a circumstance which is regrettably not uncommon in public law practices operating under Legal Aid constraints.  
Also notable were procedural delays connected to the Legal Aid Agency’s authorisation of funding to instruct a forensic psychologist—an application submitted on 10 July 2025, but only approved after prolonged correspondence and multiple escalations culminating on 22 August 2025. These recurring administrative bottlenecks generate challenges not only for the defence but halt timely progress of cases that would otherwise be ripe for resolution.  
The Better Case Management (BCM) regime, established in 2018 to expedite complex Crown Court proceedings, was engaged following your committal. Your case was listed for plea and trial preparation hearing on 28 August 2025, at which time you again maintained your not guilty plea, indicating reliance upon a contested account of the evidence. However, prior to the trial date fixed for 15 September, you entered a guilty plea.  
The timing of that plea—some seven weeks post charge and on the cusp of trial—engenders particular reflection. As established in authorities such as R v. McEnroe [2019] EWCA Crim 1742 and reiterated in R v. Simpson [2023] EWCA Crim 719, late pleas attract reduced mitigation given the additional burden they place upon witnesses, prosecuting authorities, and judicial resources.  
It is also prudent to recall the observations from R v. Faraday [2021] EWCA Crim 441 regarding the assessment of culpability when an offender engages a protracted defence strategy that ultimately yields to a plea only after overwhelming evidence is presented. Courts must be vigilant to ensure the credit accorded reflects genuine contrition and procedural economy rather than tactical manoeuvring.

The court is grateful to the prosecuting advocate, Ms Jennifer Malin, whose submissions were measured and premised on clear evidential grounds, and to Mr Liam Prescott, leading on your behalf under a Legal Aid representation order. I note the careful attention to case law and mitigating material advanced on your behalf, notwithstanding the constraints imposed by the procedural pressures and limited preparation time.  
Before turning to the facts of the offending, a brief commentary on retail crime trends is warranted, given its salience in contextualising the harm and societal impact.  
The recent annual report issued by the National Retail Security Council highlights an aggregate increase of 12% in recorded incidents of shoplifting across England and Wales during 2024, with an accompanying rise in offences involving repeat offenders. The report further notes the strain placed upon retail staff, many of whom face anxiety, stress, and, in some cases, trauma when confronting theft—especially where confrontation or aggressive behaviour arises. While your conduct did not involve overt aggression, the indirect and cumulative consequences resonate beyond financial loss.  
Similarly, the ongoing pressures experienced by the Probation Service, stemming from staff shortages and increased caseloads, underscore the need for efficient, proportional sentencing—balancing public protection with the pragmatic realities of service delivery. This court acknowledges the tireless work of probation officers such as Ms Amina Khalid, who prepared the present pre-sentence report with both thoroughness and sensitivity.

As with many cases proceeding through the Crown Court, there exists a certain disjunction between the legal categorisation of offence and the human stories intertwined. The management of lower-level acquisitive crime remains a vexed challenge, not least given the frequent overlap of substance misuse, housing insecurity, and mental health difficulties within offending populations. Nonetheless, sentencing must be anchored in established principles and statutory provisions, of which I now turn to.

Legal Framework and Relevant Authority  
Under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, theft is defined as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. The entrenchment of this provision in common law jurisprudence has prompted a voluminous body of appellate decisions refining notions of dishonesty, intent, and culpability.  
More recently, the Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences, promulgated in March 2021, sets out a graduated framework pivoting on the harm caused, culpability, and aggravating or mitigating circumstances. Although the present, geographically dispersed offending falls within the “low-value” category on individual counts, the cumulative scale elevates the overall harm classification.  
The guidance further emphasises that targeting vulnerable premises, employing concealment or deception, or causing psychological distress to victims merits elevated sentences. The thefts herein engaged numerous small retailers, some operating on narrow margins, and by persistent repetition, inflicted disruption disproportionate to mere financial loss.  
In passing, I acknowledge the decision in R v. Tranter [2022] EWCA Crim 1136, where the Court of Appeal upheld a sentence imposed on a defendant responsible for a series of thefts from charity shops. The reasoning there highlighted the adverse impact on trusts reliant upon donated goods, thereby amplifying harm beyond monetary calculation. While R v. Tranter is not binding precedent as to sentence quantum, it provides instructive context.  
Furthermore, R v. Keegan [2018] EWCA Crim 333 centred on the culpability associated with the use of distraction techniques in retail theft, affirming that such calculated methods demonstrate planning and dishonesty of a higher order than spontaneous or opportunistic acts.

Turning now to the facts underpinning the conviction:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}  

The evidence presented comprised detailed CCTV footage, multiple independent witness statements, and forensic examination of possessions recovered at arrest that correspond to stolen items.  
As is often the case in episodes of acquisitive crime, absence of violence is a mitigating factor, yet the deliberation and repetition exhibited do not support minimisation of culpability.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}  

Sophisticated concealment was evident, with items hidden beneath clothing and within shopping bags, alongside occasional manipulation of security labels and tags, consistent with offences seen elsewhere in this jurisdiction.  
Notably, multiple staff members from distinct premises reported increased anxiety and a degree of fear in their work environment—a phenomenon corroborated by surveys conducted by the Retail Workers’ Union.  
Similarly, the defendant made use of tactical timing, choosing moments when staff were distracted or during shift changes. Such conduct reflects a calculated approach rather than impulsive misjudgment.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}  

Statements from retail workers portray a pattern of behaviour that undermined morale and, in some cases, prompted changes to staffing rotas and security protocols.  
While no physical altercation occurred, the emotional toll is acknowledged as real by both victims and support networks.  
This court recognises the efforts of the Manchester Retail Support Group, a voluntary organisation that provided victim impact statements outlining business losses and human costs arising from persistent theft.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}  

The cumulative financial loss from the thefts, while arguably modest individually, amounts to several thousand pounds when aggregated, factoring in loss prevention costs, staff hours diverted to monitoring, and security investments.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}  

Despite prior interventions, including police cautions and attendance at diversionary workshops under the auspices of the Greater Manchester Police’s Shopwatch Programme, the offending persisted, indicating a failure of less formal sanctions to deter.

The court is reminded of the encouraging integration of rehabilitation-focused sentences, as manifested in examples such as R v. Sterling [2023] EWCA Crim 884, which support the deployment of targeted community orders with accredited cognitive skills and financial management modules.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}  

Your personal circumstances feature prominently in the assessment of risk and culpability.  
The probation report references a history of unstable accommodation and sporadic employment, further complicated by documented periods of substance misuse and mental health difficulties.  
Yet, engagement with available support services has been limited and inconsistent, a pattern not uncommon but concerning given the potential for intervention to reduce recidivism.  
Considerations related to personal background and vulnerability, while relevant, do not absolve one from responsibility for criminal conduct, a principle reaffirmed in R v. Goldsmith [2020] EWCA Crim 1345.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}  

Your history includes previous convictions for similar offences, including two counts of shoplifting from 2022 and a conditional discharge imposed by Manchester Magistrates’ Court in late 2023.  
Despite this, there has been no substantive change in offending behaviour.  
This pattern underscores the imperative for sentencing that combines accountability with opportunity for effective rehabilitation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}  

Expert Psychiatric and Probation Assessments  
I have had the benefit of reading the detailed psychiatric report prepared by Dr Serena Miah, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist.  
Dr Miah notes the absence of a major psychiatric disorder but highlights traits consistent with borderline impulsivity and symptoms indicative of an underlying mood instability.  
The report suggests that while these factors may contribute to your general pattern of behaviour, they do not negate moral or legal responsibility.  
The consultant also recommends continued psychological monitoring, coupled with structured community support for substance use issues.

Equally, the probation officer’s report authored by Ms Khalid is comprehensive, reflecting an understanding of both your criminogenic needs and the wider social context.  
It outlines the potential benefits of a community order incorporating a rehabilitation activity requirement, unpaid work, and tailored cognitive behavioural interventions.  
The report advises against immediate custodial sentence given the lack of violence and your stated willingness to engage with services post-conviction.  
However, it cautions about the medium-term risk if insufficient controls are put into place.

Reflections on Broader Context and Institutional Observations  
The court would be remiss if it did not comment on the wider systemic challenges pertinent to this case.  
The pressures facing local housing authorities, mental health services, and voluntary sector organisations all bear upon the effective management of persistent acquisitive offending.  
Waiting lists for adult community mental health teams in Greater Manchester currently exceed national targets by significant margins, a factor that may limit timely access to care for individuals such as yourself.  
Similarly, housing provision remains stretched, with thousands on waiting lists for social or supported housing.  
The interaction between these factors and offending patterns is complex and multifaceted, and the court acknowledges the ongoing efforts of agencies such as ShelterLink and the Manchester Outreach Partnership in mitigating homelessness and associated risks.  
However, as consistently highlighted, the effectiveness of such supports depends heavily on active participation by offenders themselves.

Of note, in a report published by the National Crime Agency in early 2025, a worrying rise was documented in acquisitive crime in the north-west region, including thefts from retail premises and fuel stations.  
The report identified emerging modus operandi involving use of “lookouts” and social media coordination, though, in this case, there is no evidence of such organised activity involving you.  
Nonetheless, the presence of such dynamics creates an environment in which repeated individual offending cannot be tolerated.  
The court further notes the strain such crime places on overstretched police resources, often diverting officers from investigations of more serious offences such as violent crime and trafficking.

A brief digression is warranted regarding evolving court procedures under the Crown Court Modernisation Programme, which has seen the introduction of digital evidence management systems and remote witness provisions across the Manchester Crown Court complex.  
While this case proceeded by conventional means, the infrastructure supporting timely listing, case tracking, and disclosure has undoubtedly improved since the establishment of the court in the 19th century as the County Assize.  
Yet, inevitable resource constraints, rising caseloads, and shifts in judicial staffing continue to present challenges.

It is also germane to remark upon the role of victim impact statements in cases of shoplifting.  
Though often underestimated, such statements are vital in reflecting lived experience and shaping judicial appreciation of harm.  
In this instance, several employees provided testimonies expressing the emotional burden arising from repeated thefts including anxiety and reduced job satisfaction, despite assurances that no physical threats were made.

The court must balance these considerations against submissions advanced on your behalf, including those referencing your efforts to secure employment and reports from social workers regarding family support.  
Your letter to the court, whilst carefully composed, must be tempered against the factual findings and prevailing sentencing principles.

Whilst we are concerned primarily with crime and punishment, the court cannot overlook the sociological lens through which recurring offending must be viewed.  
Incidents such as these occur within a social milieu marked by fluctuating economic fortunes, poverty, and, at times, social dislocation.  
That said, culpability and societal factors exist in tandem, not in substitution.  
Past case law, ranging from R v. Brewster [2017] EWCA Crim 1421 to more recent appellate rulings, confirm the judiciary’s duty to apply the criminal law firmly, while recognising mitigating circumstances as may be appropriate.

I am also cognisant of trends in social behaviour and discourse, as explored in academic reviews addressing the post-pandemic erosion of community bonds, increased reliance on social media influencers shaping youth attitudes, and the normalisation of minor rule-breaking.  
Courts must resist the temptation to moralise unduly on these broad themes but equally cannot ignore their imprint on offender psychology and public expectations.

In a somewhat tangential comparison, the Court of Appeal in R v. Trent [2022] EWCA Crim 726 dealt with an entirely distinct offence: the unlawful dumping of waste materials in a rural conservation area.  
Though unrelated, it is instructive for its explication of the cumulative harm concept and the role of community impact in sentencing.  
Likewise, it is worth recalling that co-defendants in unrelated assemblages have sometimes sought to deflect blame or minimise conduct, a tactic vigorously scrutinised by courts.

Turning back to this case, I note the presence of a supportive, if limited, network of family members who have provided letters to the court.  
Such representations, while appreciated, must be weighed against the reality of repeated offending and limited evidence of substantial personal change.

Sentencing Considerations and Conclusion  
In approaching sentence, I have carefully taken into account the principles enunciated in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, particularly those contained in sections 142 and 143 relating to the imposition of custodial and community sentences.  
The principles of proportionality, mitigation for plea, and the need to protect the public from harm inform this balance.  
I have also reviewed the Sentencing Council’s definitive guidelines on theft offences, and the associated case law.  
The circumstances warrant a sentence that reflects the persistence and premeditation underlying the offending, the impact upon victims and the wider community, and the necessity for deterrence.

Your late guilty plea will be reflected in the sentence, but only to a limited extent given the protracted nature of proceedings and the benefit derived by the prosecution and other parties from your initial denials and contest.  
Your prior convictions for similar offences weigh heavily against leniency.  
I am hopeful that through carefully designed community interventions, any custodial element, should one be imposed, could be limited, but that depends significantly on the findings of the probation service.

In line with usual practice, I reserve full sentencing until receipt of an up-to-date pre-sentence report, which will consider further the risks, rehabilitative prospects, and viable community or custodial options that suit your circumstances.  
Additional reports, including any further psychiatric or psychological assessments if warranted, will also be considered before final determination.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 15 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester.  
The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2020.  
The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the appropriate agencies.  
You are reminded of your statutory right to appeal against conviction and/or sentence, subject to the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and the relevant time limits.  
No reporting restrictions under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, section 49, are engaged unless otherwise indicated in subsequent orders.  
Costs are reserved pending sentencing.

These are the orders of the court.
