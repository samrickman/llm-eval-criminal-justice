IN THE CROWN COURT AT WATLING  
R v. MR H  
Case No. W2025/13456  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. RADCLIFFE  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today to be sentenced following your conviction for theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending spans a period of approximately eighteen months, during which you targeted multiple retail establishments within the Watling and surrounding boroughs. The Crown proceeded on a representative indictment consolidating a series of incidents under one charge, reflecting a course of conduct rather than isolated acts. 

Procedural Context  
This matter has traversed the criminal justice system with procedural precision, albeit not without delay. You were arrested on 2 April 2025 following an investigation coordinated between the Watling Metropolitan Police Service, local business security personnel, and the Watling Retail Crime Partnership. The investigative work was characterised by a concerted effort to collate digital evidence, with the police deploying advanced CCTV analytics alongside witness interviews to build a corroborative evidential picture. 

The arrest itself did not occur in isolation; it came after several weeks of targeted surveillance. Officers employed a combination of covert observation and data intelligence, which included metadata assessment of public transport usage coupled with fixed camera footage from retail premises. The operational commitment required for such investigations is notable, given the highly reactive demands placed on frontline officers at a time of significant resource constraints. The ever-increasing burden presented by non-serious crime constitutes a pressing challenge for policing agencies nationwide, and cases such as this one illustrate the tensions between finite personnel and the need for comprehensive evidential gathering.

It is necessary here to remark upon the Legal Aid Agency’s handling of the defence solicitor’s funding applications. Regrettably, there were repeated administrative delays in approving requests for independent psychological assessments, which elongated the timetable for the preparation of pre-sentence reports and defence mitigation submissions. Such delays are far from uncommon and continue to frustrate the timely progression of cases. The court holds serious reservations about the impact of these systemic inefficiencies on the equitable administration of justice.

The initial listing was for 16 June 2025 but was adjourned at the defence’s application to secure fresh medical evidence from Dr Eleanor Gilmore, Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist, whose report was ultimately received only in early August. This demonstrates the often unavoidable interaction between medical and legal timetables, especially in cases where assessment of mental health or cognitive function is relevant to sentencing options.

Notably, the Better Case Management (BCM) framework was engaged early in the proceedings, facilitating the exchange of evidence and reducing unnecessary adjournments. Such practice is by now standard but nonetheless worthy of acknowledgment amid concerns about the general pace of criminal proceedings. For this, I commend the prosecution and defence teams for their continued professional diligence.

The courtroom itself has recently undergone refurbishment. The layout now provides greater accessibility and improves acoustics, an important consideration given the length and complexity of some trials and sentencing hearings. Court officers have reported improved efficiency in case management, further contributing to the smooth conduct of proceedings.

Legal Principles and Precedents  
The analytical framework for sentencing in theft offences is well established. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 defines the offence with a clear focus on dishonesty and intent to permanently deprive the owner of property. Shoplifting sits within a spectrum of acquisitive crimes closely scrutinised by sentencing guidelines and appellate jurisprudence due to their common occurrence and cumulative impact.

Although your offences are non-violent in nature, the effect on victims — particularly small businesses and shop staff — is well documented. Repeated offending exacerbates the financial strain on proprietors already contending with increasing overheads and economic uncertainty.

The recent Sentencing Council guideline for theft, updated in late 2023, emphasises several factors pertinent to your case: the persistence of offending behaviour, the degree of premeditation, the vulnerability of victims and premises, the use of concealment or distraction tactics, and prior criminal history.

Reference is made to R v. Samson [2023] EWCA Crim 2785, where the Court of Appeal upheld a custodial sentence for a defendant found to have stolen electronic goods across multiple visits to various stores. The Court stressed that repetition and planning elevate culpability and that the psychological toll on staff — including anxiety and fears of confrontation — must be accounted for in sentencing. Similarly, R v. Eastwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1740 highlighted the aggravating role of offending targeted at independent retailers whose margins and resilience are particularly susceptible to theft.

It is also instructive to consider R v. McTavish [2021] EWCA Crim 1468, which addressed the limited availability of credit for late guilty pleas when pleas are entered only days before trial. The Court reaffirmed the principle outlined in R v. Lawrence [2022] EWCA Crim 1901 that the timing of the plea is critical to the assessment of remorse and mitigation. Given your plea was entered at this advanced stage, the sanction of reduced credit applies.

The court is acutely aware of the principle that sentences should be proportionate and individualised. The statutory aim remains the protection of the public, the punishment of offenders, and the reduction of reoffending through rehabilitative measures wherever possible.

The facts of the case are as follows:

Investigation and Evidence  
The initial trigger for investigation was a series of reports received between September 2023 and January 2024 by the Watling Business Crime Reduction Partnership, which maintains a live register of suspected shoplifters operating in the area. Retailers involved ranged from national chain outlets to smaller stores in district shopping centres. Incident data included descriptions, time stamps, and recordings from CCTV, many of which documented your presence and actions during periods of theft.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.

The prosecution relied heavily on video evidence and witness accounts from store employees. Some witnesses described you as adopting a methodical approach, deliberately selecting high-demand items such as cosmetics, over-the-counter medications, and confectionery, then concealing them beneath clothing or in bags. There was evidence you used distraction techniques, including feigning phone calls or engaging staff in conversation to divert attention while placing goods out of sight.

One store manager provided a detailed victim impact statement. They recounted the disruption to staffing arrangements caused by your repeated visits — including alterations in shift patterns, extra security measures, and increased stress among employees, some of whom requested transfers due to anxiety over potential confrontations. Though no physical violence occurred, the psychological impact was significant.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

Victim liaison officers and the local Retail Support and Recovery Network have been engaged throughout. These voluntary-sector organisations operate under severe budgetary pressures but continue to provide valuable assistance to both victims and perpetrators in seeking redress and rehabilitation. Their contributions to the sentencing process — including written submissions and support statements — are deserving of recognition.

Intriguingly, though unrelated to your charge, it is noteworthy that one of the co-defendants associated with a separate multi-count burglary case in the Watling region was found to have assaulted arresting officers with a makeshift weapon. That co-defendant’s trial was heard concurrently in another courtroom, without any intersection to your proceedings.

Psychiatric and Social Reports  
Dr Gilmore’s psychiatric report is comprehensive. She found no evidence of major mental illness or psychosis but noted traits of emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and a degree of evasiveness regarding personal circumstances. She commented on a pattern of low engagement with statutory support systems and expressed concern over your present levels of social isolation. While recommending no custodial psychiatric intervention at this stage, Dr Gilmore noted that community forensic liaison could be beneficial as part of a post-sentence support framework.

The pre-sentence report, prepared by Probation Officer Sarah Markham, provides context to your offending and personal circumstances. Ms Markham highlights your current lack of stable housing although there is no present evidence of substance misuse or involvement in gang activity. The report records your limited employment history and inconsistent engagement with previous diversionary interventions.

Ms Markham expresses concern at your refusal to engage with local housing support services, despite repeated opportunities and assistance from outreach teams. The probation outlook is cautiously optimistic, given the absence of violence or severe mental health issues, but emphasises the need for structured rehabilitative programmes aimed at decision-making, impulse control, and financial management.

It is germane to mention the increasing strain on the Probation Service nationally, which has suffered staff shortages and budget reductions over the past years. These pressures have been compounded by rising caseloads involving low-level acquisitive crime, putting further constraints on community supervision capacity.

Additional Observations  
The court takes note of correspondence from ShelterWatling, a local homelessness charity, acknowledging their ongoing attempts to make contact with you. Their letter emphasises the challenges faced by all agencies involved in supporting individuals caught in cycles of offending and unstable accommodation. It speaks to the broader societal context in which offences such as yours arise, reminding the court of the necessity — and difficulty — of integrating criminal justice with social care.

Beyond the immediate scope of your offending, it is pertinent to observe the continuing rise in street homelessness and beggary in the Watling area, contributing to a sense of unease in public spaces. While no direct link is established here, the court is mindful of the multifaceted challenges faced by vulnerable individuals, including intersectional deprivation, mental health difficulties, and marginalisation.

The Royal Institution of Retail Crime Prevention recently published a report indicating that shoplifting accounts for approximately 35% of all retail losses nationally, with the majority being low-value but repetitive offences. Their research underlines the disproportionate burden on small retailers, many of whom operate at minimal margins and lack the resources for enhanced security.

A further and unrelated note: the trial of D Simmons, charged with environmental offences at the nearby Greenbelt Conservation Area, currently occupies considerable court room resources. That case involves illegal fly-tipping and subsequent ecological damage, and has caused some administrative knock-on effects, including scheduling shortages that have impacted listing options across this court.

Sentencing Framework and Considerations  
At this juncture, the court must weigh a number of mitigating and aggravating factors before determining an appropriate sentence. The aggravating features include the sustained nature of the offending, the deliberate method employed, the psychological impact on victims and retail staff, and your previous convictions for like offences, including a community order breach in 2023.

Mitigating factors include your plea of guilty, albeit late in the process, the absence of any threats, violence or weapon use, and some history of attempts to engage with support services, even if inconsistently.

The court acknowledges the impact of social determinants in your circumstances — unstable housing, financial precarity, and limited employment opportunities. Nevertheless, these factors neither excuse nor justify a heading into a pattern of criminality; rather, they contextualise it.

As noted in R v. Brennan [2024] EWCA Crim 2123, a case concerning repeat low-level retail theft, a balanced sentencing approach must seek to promote rehabilitation while delivering deterrence and maintaining public confidence. That case endorsed the use of structured community orders with a focus on cognitive behavioural therapy and financial management training in appropriate cases. Custodial sentences remain justified where there is evidence of persistent disregard for the law and repeated failure to engage with diversionary measures. 

Your previous record, including a caution and two convictions for similar theft offences dating back to 2021 and 2022, demonstrate a regrettable pattern of recidivism. Attempts at community-based disposals have evidently not produced sustained compliance or desistance.

It is the duty of the court to protect local businesses and the public at large from the harm caused by such courses of conduct. Though your behaviour did not involve physical harm, the dimensions of economic loss, staff anxiety, and diminished retail confidence are material and must be reflected in the sentence.

The court is mindful also of the need to ensure any disposal balances public protection with the prospect of rehabilitation; this requires access to appropriate programmes and support mechanisms, which the probation service will be tasked to identify and recommend.

Conclusion and Directions  
In light of the above, I intend to defer sentence to allow receipt of a full and updated pre-sentence report incorporating the latest psychiatric findings and any further relevant information concerning your circumstances. This will enable the court to impose a measured and informed sentence calibrated to your risk of reoffending and prospects for rehabilitation.

I must reiterate my thanks to counsel for their submissions today. Ms Tara Jenkins has appeared for the Crown with professionalism and clarity, while Mr Declan Reeves has represented you diligently under a Legal Aid representation order, notwithstanding the inevitable challenges posed by delayed expert funding and support.

The hearing is conducted in open court. I trust that the judicial and administrative bodies involved in this matter will continue to work towards efficient, proportionate and just outcomes, not least in recognition of the substantial pressures facing all agencies involved — from policing and probation to voluntary sector providers and legal services.

The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal any sentence imposed within the prescribed period. There are no reporting restrictions engaged in these proceedings. Costs are reserved pending sentencing.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 17 September 2025, in Court 6 at Watling Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentencing hearing is scheduled for 5 November 2025, pending the receipt of reports and submissions.

These are the orders of the court.
