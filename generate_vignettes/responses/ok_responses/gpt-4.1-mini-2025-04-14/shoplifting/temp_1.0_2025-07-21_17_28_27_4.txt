IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHWARK  
R v. MR H  
Case Number: T2025/13429  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. E. Bramwell  
Filed: 14 August 2025  

Mr H, you appear today for sentence in relation to a charge of theft from retail premises, an offence contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. This prosecution concerns a series of shoplifting offences alleged to have taken place over a period spanning from late 2023 through to early 2025, largely in the SE1 and SE16 postal districts of London boroughs. The Crown relies upon a representative count before this court but invites sentencing to reflect the extended course of conduct indicated by the evidence.

Procedural History and Courtroom Process  
This matter was first allocated to Hertford Crown Court on 12 March 2025 following your arrest on 2 March 2025, arising from multi-agency collaboration spearheaded by the Southwark Business Crime Reduction Unit (BCRU) with operational input from the Metropolitan Police Service’s Retail Theft Task Force. The initial arrest followed a lengthy inquiry involving covert observation, local CCTV collation, and engagement with store managers across several retail units. On arraignment you were granted conditional bail and gave no indication of plea. The case was subsequently transferred here to Southwark Crown Court on 18 April 2025 for trial under the Better Case Management pilot scheme currently operating in the jurisdiction. 

The case management hearings proceeded as per the Criminal Procedure Rules’ indicative timetable, with some delay attributable to compounding Legal Aid application issues and defence counsel’s request for further disclosure of digital evidence. The court is, regrettably, all too well acquainted with such difficulties—the repeated administrative obstacles posed by the Legal Aid Agency in terms of expert funding applications having a disruptive effect on case progression. This is neither isolated nor exceptional and is a cause for ongoing professional concern.

At the plea and trial preparation hearing on 29 June 2025, you entered a guilty plea—albeit at a relatively late stage in the proceedings. It is well-established jurisprudence that such timing will temper credit accorded. The starting point must always be the recognition of genuine remorse balanced against the effect of delay on the resources expended by the prosecution, witnesses, and courts. As set out in the authoritative decision in R v. Jennings [2020] EWCA Crim 437, the court reiterated that the discount for plea is neither automatic nor without qualification, and remains within judicial discretion.

The wider social framework within which these offences occur should not be overlooked. The court is mindful that shoplifting, though frequently minimised by some as ‘victimless’ or ‘petty,’ entails real consequences for local businesses, employees, and communities—particularly independent retailers operating on tight margins. The cumulative effect of persistent retail theft contributes to an erosion of confidence, loss of income, increased security spending, and psychological distress among staff who are often among the most vulnerable in the workplace.

In addition to the evidential objectives pursued by law enforcement, the role of the Business Crime Reduction Partnership has grown in recent years as a vital bridge between the private and public sectors in combating acquisitive crime. Multi-agency meetings facilitate intelligence sharing, data analytics, and prioritisation of persistent offenders. The current prosecution is the product of such concerted efforts. However, the court is conscious that local authorities and voluntary bodies face relentless resource pressures, exacerbated by competing demands arising from increasing rates of street homelessness, antisocial behaviour, and the impacts of financial hardship on communities.

The case attracted considerable attention from the Southwark Integrated Substance Misuse Service (SIMS), which prepared representations detailing your historical and current engagement with alcohol dependency programmes. The report compiled by Dr Ami Patel, Consultant Psychiatrist, dated 10 July 2025, is notably detailed and professionally prepared. Dr Patel opines that while you show marked ambivalence to treatment, there remains potential for engagement should a suitable intervention be supported and enforced. However, Dr Patel emphasises that progress is contingent upon your active participation and warns that absent such engagement, the risk of reoffending remains elevated.

It must be noted that the clinical opinion was sought at the request of your defence team following a formal application to instruct an independent forensic psychiatrist with experience in acquisitive offending. Such expert evidence, while not determinative, plays an important role in providing the court with context for risk assessment and the appropriateness of community disposals versus custodial sentences.

It bears comment that the Legal Aid Agency’s delay in approving the instructions for Dr Patel’s assessment led to a necessary adjournment of sentencing hearings, impacting the overall court listing schedule. That such procedural hindrances persist in 2025 is cause for institutional reflection, given the Priority Areas listed by the Ministry of Justice for reform in the coming financial year.

In terms of statutory framework, section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the governing provision. The Theft Offences Sentencing Guidelines (2022 edition) provide an explicit framework for determining the gravity of the offending and the appropriate sentencing outcome, balancing culpability against harm. The guideline recognises levels of harm ranging from negligible to serious physical and psychological distress, and culpability levels that correspond to planning, premeditation, sophistication, or opportunism.

The Court must also bear in mind the guidance set out in R v Whitehead [2019] EWCA Crim 2365, which stressed critical importance of tailoring sentences to the offender’s antecedents, degree of persistence in offending, and the impact individual crimes have on victim communities. While Whitehead arose in the context of aggravated burglary, its principles on sentencing persistence and community impact have been held highly persuasive in acquisitive crime matters by subsequent courts.

It is also necessary to refer to the jurisprudence in R v Gallimore [2021] EWCA Crim 642 concerning the latency of guilty pleas. In that case, the Court of Appeal substantially clarified the limits of credit where pleas are handed in at a late juncture — particularly in cases employing extensive CCTV evidence and digital trilateration tracking. Whilst concessions for procedural economy remain lawful, the court retains full discretion to modify any such credit in consideration of wider public interest and the impact on victims and the court system.

The facts of the offending, carefully outlined by the Crown, depict a pattern not of random isolated incidents, but a course of conduct exhibiting elements of planning, concealment, and a deliberate targeting of regular, accessible retail businesses. The court received materials from independent retailers — often family-run or local to the community — reporting fluctuating staffing patterns and increased security expenditures as a direct consequence of the defendant’s conduct.

It is furthermore of note that victim impact statements tendered by several employees disclose a material reduction in workplace morale and increased feelings of vulnerability. One senior supervisor at a corner shop described the defendant’s return visits as “a source of dread,” noting palpable anxiety among part-time staff and newly recruited assistants, some of whom had contemplated resignation. It is often insufficiently appreciated that such offences bear psychological harm which, while lacking physical force, nonetheless disrupts normal routines and communities in tangible and harmful ways.

The Probation Service prepared a standard pre-sentence report, tendered in draft form to this court on 5 August 2025. Probation Officer Ms Rose Williams furnished an assessment that candidly addresses offending history, social circumstances, and prospects for rehabilitation. Ms Williams comments critically on your prior failure to comply meaningfully with community orders and expresses concern about the intermittent engagement with addiction support services. Furthermore, the report highlights ongoing housing instability and the impact this has on your risk profile, observing that transitory accommodation and lack of routine impede consistent participation in interventions. 

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

It is a tacit acknowledgement that many defendants presenting before the courts are caught within a nexus of complicating vulnerabilities, including unstable accommodation, disadvantage, addiction, and mental health challenges. Courts do not ignore these factors, but neither are they absolved from applying the law and protecting wider public safety. The balancing act remains delicate and difficult.

It is also relevant to mention that the court noted the presence of family support letters from your sister and aunt, dated 1 and 3 July 2025 respectively, which portray you as a person of goodwill but beleaguered by difficult circumstances. Whilst these are significant as emotive context, there remains no evidential suggestion that they impinge upon your personal accountability. Courts must weigh familial advocacy against the independent findings of professional assessments.

As alluded to earlier, the Business Crime Reduction Partnership convened a meeting on 15 May 2025 following a quarterly review of crime trends in SE16, which included detailed analysis of theft hotspots and repeat offender planning. The Partnership, despite facing chronic funding shortfalls, has continued to prioritise data-driven approaches and victim liaison—all of which have contributed meaningfully in shaping the investigation and focus of the Crown’s case.

On a procedural note, I commend court staff, ushers, and clerks here at Southwark Crown Court for their diligent efforts in managing the increasingly complex logistics of multi-defendant cases. While your matter is single defendant, the backlog across Crown Courts nationally has been exacerbated by industrial action among court reporting staff earlier this year, affecting listing timetables and availability of interpreters. We acknowledge and appreciate the commitment of all involved to maintaining the machinery of justice under such challenging conditions.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Turning momentarily to precedent of a tangential nature, the Court recalls R v Pratt [2017] EWCA Crim 2589, which concerned an aggravated affray occasioned following a pub dispute involving pool cues and other blunt instruments. While Pratt’s facts bear no direct relationship with shoplifting, the case is illustrative of the judiciary’s increasing sensitivity to the cumulative impact of low-level offences on community cohesion. It underscores the principle that even offences lacking in gravity when viewed discretely may collectively amount to significant social harm.

Similarly, the Court notes in passing the recent decision in R v Langley [2024] EWCA Crim 717, a case involving criminal damage to a church noticeboard and related public nuisance offences. Again, Langley is entirely unrelated to these proceedings; however, it demonstrates the judiciary’s consistent approach to recognising the wider ramifications of property offences beyond mere financial loss.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

I turn now to important considerations concerning suspensions, community orders, and custodial sentencing thresholds. The legal framework as articulated in the Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft contemplates a spectrum of disposals aligned to culpability, harm, and offender background. Custody is reserved for cases surpassing a defined seriousness level, whilst community orders remain viable where the court is satisfied of realistic prospects of rehabilitation and sufficient compliance likelihood.

Your record includes previous convictions for similar offences, some disposed of by community resolution and conditional discharge. The court is mindful of decisions such as R v Davies [2023] EWCA Crim 1012, where the Court recognised that repeat acquisitive offending is a serious aggravating factor meriting custodial sentences unless compelling mitigating factors are present. The persistence of offending despite prior interventions increases concern regarding risk of reoffending.

Experts presented evidence that your offending is linked to situational factors, including substance use and economic precariousness. The dual role of rehabilitation and public protection underpins the sentencing rationale. The court is conscious of the pressures upon the Probation Service and community providers, whose capacity to deliver effective intervention is often strained by rising demand and restricted resources.

To conclude, this hearing has proceeded in open court presence. I extend my formal thanks to Ms Caroline Edwards, who appeared for the Crown, and to Mr Nathaniel Greene, representing the defence pursuant to a Legal Aid representation order. Both counsel have conducted themselves professionally throughout.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 August 2025, in Court 9 of the Crown Court at Southwark. Proceedings have been recorded and transcribed as mandated by Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal sentencing hearing will be scheduled no sooner than 11 September 2025, to allow for receipt of updated reports and any further submissions. The defendant is reminded of the right of appeal under section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, within 28 days of sentence. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved. 

These are the orders of the court.
