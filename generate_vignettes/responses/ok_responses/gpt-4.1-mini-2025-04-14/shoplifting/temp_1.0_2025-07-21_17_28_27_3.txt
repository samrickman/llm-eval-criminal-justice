IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. B2025/17429  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. P. Calloway  
Filed: 27 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in relation to a representative count of theft by shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offending behaviour charged reflects a longer course of conduct throughout 2024 and early 2025, principally in retail outlets situated within Brighton city centre and adjacent seafront districts.  

Procedural and Investigative Overview  
The charges before the court stem from an investigation instigated by Brighton and Hove City Police’s dedicated Retail Crime Unit, working in conjunction with the newly formed Sussex Business Crime Alliance. The Alliance aims to improve coordination between law enforcement and local traders by fostering enhanced intelligence-sharing, rapid incident reporting, and joint targeted patrols. The origin of this inquiry lies in incident reports submitted by multiple retail outlets suffering consistent stock loss and suspicious customer activity believed linked to a common suspect. These businesses ranged from small independent chemists to larger chain convenience stores.

The investigation progressed through painstaking collation of photographic and video surveillance, inventory reconciliation, and detailed witness statements from store personnel. This extensive assembly of evidence was crucial, as the offences fall within the category of “low value but high impact” thefts, which present particular challenges for the criminal justice process. While individual dollar values at issue per theft were modest, their cumulative drain on business sustainability and staff wellbeing was far from negligible.

This court is well acquainted with the practical difficulties inherent in prosecuting retail theft. The volume of cases routinely exceeds frontline capacity, and the evidential standard required for conviction demands precision. CCTV footage often suffers from poor image quality, and subject identification can be impeded by variations in subject clothing or occlusions. This places considerable burden on prosecutors, many of whom must balance thoroughness against the competing demands of case preparedness for higher-profile matters.

The Brighton Business Crime Alliance, though only recently established, has demonstrated some degree of effectiveness according to internal reviews. Its capacity to bring together police officers, store security managers, local council licensing teams and community liaison officers remains constrained by fluctuating budgets and personnel shortages, but it has facilitated faster responses to recurring incidents and engendered modest improvements in proactive offender management strategies. It is hoped that such partnerships will continue to evolve with expanding remit and resources, though in many respects the day-to-day work remains largely painstaking and discrete.

In due course, police officers executing search warrants recovered personal effects belonging to you, as well as goods subsequently identified by victims as stolen property. Forensic examination matched fibres found in your clothing to those taken from a number of premises that had reported thefts during the material period. Owing to the accumulation of these investigative elements, bail was refused on the grounds of flight risk and potential reoffending, and your remand ordered forthwith.

The matter was first listed before the magistrates on 14 March 2025. However, owing to complexity and anticipated volume of evidence, the decision was taken to allocate the case for Crown Court trial under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme. This is in line with the procedural framework promulgated under the Criminal Procedure Rules, intended to promote early clarity and efficient progression of indictable and triable either-way offences.

The BCM hearings proceeded with an initial case management hearing on 21 April, and a subsequent pre-trial review on 18 June. Both hearings reflected the standard practice of addressing evidential readiness, disclosure issues, and any applications pertaining to expert evidence. Thereafter, the plea and trial preparation hearing was scheduled for 30 July, at which you entered a guilty plea to the single representative count. This late plea conforms with a pattern encountered all too frequently, whereby defendants avail themselves of the well-established mechanism to contest prosecution through protracted procedural avenues before acknowledging culpability once conviction is inevitable.

That your plea was not entered at the earliest opportunity necessarily tempers the extent of mitigation the court may consider. The Court of Appeal’s decision in R v. Lowther [2023] EWCA Crim 2030 makes clear that the timing and sincerity of guilty pleas remain determinant factors in assessing discount. Mr Lowther’s unsuccessful appeal concerned a burglary charge where the defendant pleaded guilty at trial, offering minimal assistance in expedition or procedural economy. The judgment unequivocally stated that late pleas, while lawful, ought not to be met with automatic leniency but rather subjected to judicial scrutiny and proportionate adjustment.

Further authority of note includes R v. Twining [2024] EWCA Crim 1174, which examined the impact of repeated reoffending in acquisitive crime contexts. The Court underlined the importance of confronting continued criminality with appropriately increased severity, particularly where prior warnings and diversion schemes had failed to yield desistance.

I would also make reference, however tangential, to the case of R v. Fenwick [2019] EWCA Crim 450, which involved aggravated trespass at a rural agricultural site. Though unrelated to the present facts, it serves as a judicial touchstone for distinguishing between offences that are straightforward breaches of property rights and those that carry broader implications for community safety or environmental harm. Fenwick reinforces the principle that courts must weigh carefully the public interest in safeguarding shared spaces from incursions, a consideration that, while unlikely to apply here, contextualises sentencing jurisprudence.

Beyond the criminal law, the procedural course has been complicated somewhat by administrative delays experienced in obtaining authority to instruct a forensic psychiatric expert. The Legal Aid Agency’s protracted response times, documented in correspondence dated 11 May and 7 June respectively, occasioned postponements in hearing dates and limited the defence’s ability to prepare mitigation material. It is regrettable that funding bureaucracy so frequently impedes litigant rights to timely assessments, a phenomenon lamented in multiple civil society reports and parliamentary inquiries.

A further complication arose with relation to continuity of representation; your initial solicitor withdrew due to conflict and was replaced on 3 July. While Ms Eleanor Strickland QC has since provided robust advocacy, the disruption occasioned by the transition understandably complicated defence preparation.

Victim Impact and Support Services  
The court wishes to record its appreciation for the written representations of the Brighton Retailers’ Association, as well as victim impact statements tendered by individual store managers across affected locations. These statements articulate not merely financial loss but the cumulative erosion of staff morale and the necessity of operational adjustments, such as shortened opening hours and increased security protocols. They highlight the psychological toll on employees, who described feelings of vulnerability and intimidation notwithstanding the non-violent nature of the offences.

Notably, the Brighton Support Network for Retail Workers (BSNRW) has provided evidence on the wellbeing consequences of such offending. The network emphasises the growing prevalence of stress-related absenteeism and burnout among shop staff consequent to persistent thefts. Their submission additionally noted the impact on recruitment and retention, with certain retail workers citing safety concerns as a factor in declining role continuation.

This is emblematic of a wider landscape in which retail offences, although categorised as “volume crime,” exert a disproportionate effect on vulnerable workers. The court does not underestimate these consequences and takes the views conveyed most seriously when calibrating an appropriate sentence.

It should be noted that staff interviewed during the investigation frequently remarked upon the pattern of offending as “methodical” and “opportunistic,” with particular targeting of aisles displaying toiletries, over-the-counter medicines, and high-resale-value consumables. Such deliberate conduct militates against any inference of casual or spur-of-the-moment theft.

Within the social context, Brighton continues to grapple with entrenched socioeconomic challenges, including rising homelessness, substance dependency issues, and constrained social services capacity. These broader factors are neither an excuse nor a justification for criminal activity, yet they intersect with offender profiles in complex ways. The present case, involving a defendant without stable accommodation and with sporadic engagement with voluntary support agencies, exemplifies these entanglements.

Mental Health and Forensic Psychiatric Reports  
Dr Alice Henshaw, consultant forensic psychiatrist instructed on behalf of the defence, provided a comprehensive report dated 21 August 2025. Her assessment concludes that while Mr H does not meet the threshold for a major mental disorder, he exhibits traits consistent with impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and mild substance use dependency.

Dr Henshaw emphasises the interplay between psychosocial stressors—namely financial hardship, unstable housing, and lack of structured daily routine—and your offending behaviour. Her recommendations advocate for enhanced mental health outreach and engagement with community drug and alcohol treatment programmes alongside cognitive behavioural therapy focusing on decision-making.

While the report is clinically detailed and professionally cogent, the court is mindful that mitigation arising from such findings must be balanced against the necessity to uphold public protection and confidence. In R v. Mallory [2008] EWCA Crim 1624, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the presence of mental disorder, in and of itself, does not preclude appropriate custodial sentencing where criminal conduct evidences persistent disregard for public safety.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

Historical social care records disclose intermittent contact with child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in the defendant’s teenage years, beginning at approximately age 14. While those records indicate episodes of anxiety and low mood, no sustained diagnosis or inpatient admissions were recorded, and there is no evidence of psychosis or substance-induced psychotic episodes.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

The social services department of Brighton and Hove City Council provided documentation indicating periodic involvement from housing support officers attempting to liaise with Mr H over the preceding 18 months. Regrettably, these efforts were met with limited engagement, highlighting the challenge of sustaining meaningful contact with individuals experiencing chaotic life circumstances.

Public Policy and Court Resource Considerations  
It is necessary at this juncture to acknowledge the broader context within which this court operates. Criminal justice practitioners today contend with a system under profound strain: rising case volumes, constrained budgets, and workforce shortages compound the complexity of delivering timely justice. 

The Sussex Probation Service, while committed to evidence-based rehabilitative endeavors, operates at reduced staffing ratios with prevalent caseload overspills. This often impedes proactive supervision and the thorough implementation of community sentences or diversionary orders. Correspondingly, the Legal Aid Agency struggles with procedural backlogs aggravated by shifting eligibility criteria and technology challenges, as observed in parliamentary committee reports from earlier this year.

Moreover, courts themselves face persistent obstacles such as intermittent industrial action impacting court clerks and judges, outdated physical infrastructure limiting capacity, and the ever-growing demand for digital case management platforms. These factors collectively influence the pace and thoroughness with which cases progress from charge to resolution.

In sentencing, these systemic pressures must never dilute the imperative for proportionate justice. However, they provide a backdrop against which decisions on sentencing type and length must be situated directionally, including choices to divert suitable offenders from custody where possible.

The court is grateful to the legal teams on both sides—particularly to Ms Imogen Yeats for the Crown and to Mr Daniel Grey for the defence—whose submissions were measured and professional. Court ushering and administration staff have conducted themselves with commendable efficiency amidst the occasional disruption.

Several organisational bodies contributed written statements or reports, including the Brighton Shopfront Safety Partnership and the Sussex Independent Retailers Forum. Their engagement is particularly noteworthy given the deep cuts experienced by local authorities in crime prevention and victim support funding.

The defendant’s written letter to the court, submitted by his counsel immediately prior to this hearing, was thoughtfully composed and expressed contrition, albeit in measured terms. It acknowledges the strain imposed on local businesses and the discomfort felt by staff. However, the letter also recounts instances of personal hardship without wholly connecting these to personal agency or responsibility.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

The court received a statement from a sister of the defendant, Ms Jemima H., detailing familial background and childhood instability. While such personal history may provide context, it must not be treated as excusing repeated criminal behaviour. As emphasised in R v. Calderwood [2022] EWCA Crim 1627, hardship and trauma, though real, are not synonymous with absolution.

Discussing broader criminal justice developments, it is worth noting that while the Court of Appeal has underscored the importance of early guilty pleas and engagement ("R v. Heatherton [2022] EWCA Crim 2253"), it has also clarified that repeated relapses into acquisitive offending attract enhanced custodial consideration ("R v. Gordon [2023] EWCA Crim 1402").

While some may regard shoplifting as a “victimless” crime, this court emphatically rejects such characterisation. The cumulative effect on small businesses—many already struggling amid economic downturn and rising rents—can be devastating. Furthermore, the erosion of retail worker morale and the proliferation of security measures to deter theft exact collateral costs that disrupt community cohesion.

No doubt there are wider societal forces at play: increased street homelessness and visible begging, an expanding informal economy, and the normalisation of low-level antisocial conduct in some public places. While these phenomena may inform policy discussions, they cannot dilute individual accountability.

I record appreciation for the work of volunteers at Brighton’s Haven Project, which provides outreach to vulnerable populations, many of whom are peripheral to but affected by criminal justice interventions. Their insights into behavioural drivers of acquisitive crime highlight the interplay between social marginality and offending behaviour.

The court also acknowledges correspondence from the UK Retail Crime Watch, which shares intelligence and best practice guidelines for managing repeat offenders. Their focus on “diversion and rehabilitation first” aligns with current best evidence but underscores the challenge posed by individuals who fail to engage despite available pathways.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

An updated probation pre-sentence report will be critical in the sentencing decision, and the court requests that the probation officer explore all viable community-based interventions including cognitive skills programmes, substance misuse treatment, and supported housing referrals. Consideration of a rehabilitation activity requirement is warranted where appropriate.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.  

It bears mention that although your previous criminal record includes convictions for theft and minor public order offences, there are no recorded instances of violence or weapons-related charges. There is similarly no suggestion of connection to organised crime groups or networks.

Sentencing Framework  
Section 78(1) of the Sentencing Act 2020 compels courts to impose sentences proportionate to the offending behaviour, with due regard to harm caused, culpability demonstrated, and personal mitigation.

Within the Theft Act 1968 context, the Sentencing Council’s guidelines encourage sentencing reflective of the pattern and impact of offending, with aggravated theft offences attracting higher sentences where offender sophistication or victim vulnerability is evident.

Community sentences must be considered where they are suitable and can be monitored effectively; custody remains a last resort but may be appropriate where repeated acquisitive offending shows little prospect of rehabilitation through less restrictive means.

Given these principles and the evidence before the court, final sentencing will not be passed today. Rather, the court will await the full pre-sentence report, supplemented by any updated psychiatric or welfare assessments.

The hearing today has been conducted in the presence of all parties, with full representation and proper procedure observed. I thank the court staff at Brighton Crown Court for their assistance in facilitating this sitting.

These sentencing remarks are issued on 27 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton, pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of the right to appeal conviction or sentence, within the statutory deadlines set out under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
