IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRIGHTON  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2026/03815  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. L. FOSTER  
Filed: 18 September 2026  

Mr H, you appear today before this court for sentence in relation to offences of theft committed on multiple occasions at retail outlets scattered across the Brighton and Hove area between late 2023 and early 2026. The charges have been brought pursuant to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, and concern the deliberate and repeated appropriation of property from retail premises without payment.

Procedural History and Preliminary Observations  
Your case was first listed before the Brighton Magistrates’ Court on 10 January 2026. Due to the accumulated seriousness and multiplicity of the allegations, the matter was subsequently transferred to this Crown Court. This transfer was governed by the Better Case Management (BCM) framework, a judicial case allocation scheme intended to ensure cases are dealt with at the appropriate level for disposition and that the administration of justice operates efficiently. The BCM protocol emphasises expeditious disclosure and clear identification of issues, and, on this occasion, I note some commendable adherence to the indicative timelines, notwithstanding certain procedural adjournments and delays discussed below.

In the months preceding the transfer, local policing teams, in conjunction with the Brighton Retail Crime Strategy Partnership, undertook an exhaustive and resource-intensive investigation. The case involved scrutiny of CCTV footage spanning numerous retail premises, collection of witness statements from various store personnel, and forensic examination of items retrieved from your person and immediate environment at the time of arrest. While the detailed evidential marches through this investigation are appropriately recorded in the Crown Prosecution Service’s file, the court recognises the substantial diversion of policing effort and public resources necessitated by a pattern of low-value but persistent offences.

The court further notes, with some regret, that the Legal Aid Agency's administrative processes introduced avoidable delay at key junctures of preparation. Applications for expert psychiatric input were subjected to extended internal review, with authorisation taking four weeks from initial submission despite the apparent relevance to the determination of culpability and sentencing mitigation. This frustration is compounded by the acknowledged strains on criminal defence practitioners and the wider public defence system, as documented in recent Ministry of Justice reports. While beyond the court's direct purview, it remains an area warranting reform for the sake of justice administration.

In the intervening period, two plea hearings were convened. At the first, you entered a plea of not guilty; at the subsequent hearing, shortly before trial listing, you elected to change your plea to guilty. The court is obliged to acknowledge this admission, albeit made relatively late in proceedings, and will take that into account in mitigation.

The cumulative nature of this offending, combined with the procedural history, provides the backdrop against which sentencing will be conducted.

Legal Context and Relevant Authority  
The offence of theft, as codified in the Theft Act 1968, is defined by the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner thereof. While individual instances of shoplifting may readily be dealt with in summary proceedings or by fixed penalty notices, persistent and organised courses of theft are rightly the subjects of Crown Court consideration and custodial sentencing where appropriate.

The Sentencing Council's guideline for theft offences (July 2021 edition) emphasises factors aggravating culpability, including repeated offending, targeting vulnerable victims or premises, use of disguise or deception, and the disturbance caused to retail staff. The species of offending here bears a clear relationship to those aggravating criteria.

Case law further informs the exercise of sentencing discretion. For example, R v. Bedford [2019] EWCA Crim 1472 established that cumulative courses of acquisitive crime warrant particular attention to deterrence and public protection, particularly when prior warnings and interventions have failed to effect cessation. In R v. Bashir [2022] EWCA Crim 115, the Court underscored the impact of repeated shoplifting on small businesses and the psychological fatigue suffered by staff, holding that even lower-value thefts, when persistent, could justify immediate custodial penalties.

In the present matter, it is necessary to balance the principle of proportionality with the imperative of addressing sustained offending that erodes retail security and public confidence.

It is proper also to observe that the court's remit does not extend to broader social policy or welfare provision. Nonetheless, it cannot ignore the realities of the operating environment in which this offending occurred, nor the complex web of contributing factors often attendant upon such conduct.

The investigation supporting the charges involved the co-ordination of multiple agencies. Officers from the Sussex Police Retail Crime Unit liaised closely with the Brighton Business Crime Reduction Partnership, a coalition of retailers, police, local authority officials, and community representatives. The Partnership aims to share intelligence efficiently, deliver targeted crime prevention measures, and support victims. While the system has improved in recent years, its effectiveness is sometimes hampered by fluctuating funding streams and stretched personnel resources. Nevertheless, in this case, suitable notifications were issued to all premises affected, and ad hoc patrols were strategically deployed.

In parallel, it is appropriate to comment on the efforts of the Local Victim Services provision. Victim impact statements have been provided by several of the stores from which goods were stolen. While the value of individual items may appear modest—sometimes only a handful of toiletries or confectionery products—the constancy and repetition of theft has caused tangible distress to retail staff. Many of these employees are part-time workers, often students, who experience heightened anxiety in the workplace, and some have altered their shift patterns or resigned early as a consequence. The statements demonstrate well the cumulative psychological toll, underscoring that victimhood in theft extends beyond financial loss.

As a procedural footnote, the matter was briefly delayed because of a nationwide Court staff strike on 12 May 2026, which resulted in the adjournment of several hearings scheduled for that week. The impact of such industrial action is regrettable, particularly insofar as it extends the uncertainty faced both by victims and defendants. This short disruption formed one of the several unavoidable setbacks in the case timeline.

It is necessary, at this juncture, to recall that during the investigation, forensic analyses highlighted a pattern of items linked to certain supply chains, and contact traces suggested possible association with third parties unknown to the defendant. However, enquiries did not establish any evidence implicating other individuals. The court is reminded, as ever, that responsibility in criminal matters is personal and distinct: co-conspirators or accessory parties not charged or proven responsible must not be conflated with the present defendant.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

The defendant’s representatives submitted several letters of support, including correspondence from family members and a housing support officer overseeing your present accommodation in temporary lodgings arranged through the local council’s homelessness prevention scheme. The letters describe your recent efforts to engage with employment services and make modest but consistent steps towards personal stability. The housing officer states that, notwithstanding financial setbacks and prior instability, you have not breached tenancy conditions, and your participation in tenancy sustainment courses is ongoing.

This positive engagement is noteworthy, though it must be acknowledged that the absence of a secure and permanent home continues to present challenges, both practical and psychological.

Additionally, a report from the City Mental Health Outreach Team was presented. The report, prepared by Dr Rosie Jameson, Consultant Psychiatrist, following a psychiatric assessment carried out in July 2026, noted the absence of significant mental illness but posited mild depressive symptoms and situational stress related to economic hardship. The report refers to subclinical markers of impulsivity and intermittent substance use, but no diagnosis of dependence or psychosis was warranted.

Dr Jameson's recommendation highlights the potential benefits of community-based support services, including cognitive-behavioural therapy and vocational rehabilitation. The report, while not excusing the offences, urges that these factors be considered when assessing appropriate sentence type and length.

It is a truism that many criminal proceedings in this jurisdiction reflect lives marked by adversity of one sort or another, including childhood deprivation, unstable family relationships, and periodic exposure to trauma. Those facts are neither cause nor justification of illegal conduct, but may inform discretionary sentencing decisions.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.

Reference is made here to the operation of relevant statutory provisions concerning mental health and criminal responsibility, including sections 35 and 36 of the Mental Health Act 1983 (as amended), which afford powers of hospital order and restriction order for defendants whose offending is associated with a diagnosed mental disorder posing risk to the public. On the evidence before the court, no such measures are indicated in this case. The matters raised in Dr Jameson’s report attract greater relevance to rehabilitation planning rather than to public protection through secure detention.

It is instructive to recall the analysis in R v. Kendall [2017] EWCA Crim 215, where a custodial sentence was imposed on an offender with diagnosed bipolar disorder who had committed aggravated burglary. The Court of Appeal upheld the sentence, observing that the presence of mental illness does not inevitably diminish culpability, particularly where the offender had demonstrated lucidity and planning.

Moreover, the sentencing guideline for theft offences expressly acknowledges the need to balance the mitigating relevance of personal circumstances against the aggravating features of offending behaviour and public interest.

I also take note of the defence's citation of R v. Lever [2020] EWCA Crim 711, a case involving low-level drug supply, in which the Court underlined the necessity of providing sentences that fit individual circumstances while maintaining deterrent force. The present case is distinguishable on both the nature of the offence and the profile of the offender.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

The police investigation was assisted by the timely provision of digital forensic evidence by the Sussex Cyber Crime Unit, whose dedicated officers examined mobile device data seized at the time of arrest. Such police forensic workloads, especially involving voluminous digital records, have risen steeply across many constabularies, stretching specialist capacity. The Cyber Crime Unit’s work was critical in corroborating the Crown’s evidence and identifying patterns of movement consistent with reported incidents.

Inter-agency liaison also extended to the Brighton City Council Environmental Health Department, who provided ancillary reports relating to the retail premises involved. One store had experienced an unrelated episode of fly-tipping at the rear of its property — discarded packaging and construction debris having been deposited illicitly by unknown persons. Though unrelated to the defendant's conduct, these factors contribute to an overall environment of disorder necessitating a robust response. The court is mindful, however, to keep such external matters distinct from the individual’s culpability.

Victim liaison officers from the Sussex Police Victim Care Unit assisted employees impacted by the thefts in accessing counselling and support services. These engagements impress upon the court the ongoing social effects of repeated acquisitive crime beyond straightforward economic loss.

Let me also record brief appreciation for the work of the Sussex Probation Service, despite chronic staffing shortages and case overload. Probation officers handling community orders in the Brighton area manage caseloads frequently exceeding the recommended maximums, impeding the capacity for intensive supervision. In this context, the prospect of securing tailored interventions must be viewed with cautious optimism.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

In the course of these proceedings, the court received an unsolicited letter from the Brighton Homelessness Action Group, a voluntary organisation supporting rough sleepers and those at risk of destitution. The letter emphasised the scale of housing insecurity in the area, citing a 23% increase in single-person temporary accommodation placements over the past year. While the letter did not address your case specifically, it offered an important societal perspective.

The court acknowledges the challenges facing statutory and voluntary sectors alike in responding to acute housing need. It is, however, incumbent upon individuals in receipt of such support to demonstrate personal commitment to lawful conduct. The system provides, but it cannot substitute for individual responsibility.

It is regrettable that in some cases, the court sees limited readiness from defendants to engage fully with available support, choosing instead to maintain a trajectory of offending which undermines both their own prospects and public confidence.

The trend also reflects the growing administrative complexity within multi-agency public protection arrangements. Coordination between housing authorities, law enforcement, health providers, and community services is essential yet often hampered by divergent priorities and limited resources. This complexity was noted in the 2025 report of the independent Public Services Oversight Panel, which cited Brighton as a microcosm of systemic pressures.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

I must comment on an aspect of administrative procedure which incidentally arose in this case. The scheduling of court hearings underwent forced revision due to the unavailability of qualified interpreter services for a late-arising witness statement, an issue not uncommon in multi-lingual urban settings. The court recognises the importance of ensuring comprehensive access to justice for all participants but acknowledges the logistical challenges inherent in securing timely interpretation support—a challenge compounded by the ongoing Covid-19 recovery phase.

Defence counsel, Mr Peter Goldsmith, is to be commended for his diligent representation and comprehensive submissions. The prosecution was ably conducted by Ms Lilian Marks, who maintained the Crown’s case with appropriate balance and fealty to evidential standards.

At the plea hearing, it became necessary to address the courts’ approach to credit for guilty pleas, particularly given the late stage at which yours was entered. As established in R v. Halliday [2019] EWCA Crim 953, the timing of plea is a key factor in awarding discount; an early plea, before extensive trial preparation, evidences genuine remorse and conserves court resources. Conversely, a plea entered at or near trial offers limited mitigation. These principles guide this court.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

Turning to the substantive facts: the offending conduct occurred over a sustained period within a handful of commercial premises, exhibiting a consistent modus operandi. Surveillance footage analysed by prosecution experts revealed deliberate concealment techniques, including layering of garments and the use of bags to obscure stolen items. The deliberate timing of actions to minimise staff attention reflects a calculated approach rather than impulsive conduct.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

While no threats or direct violence were involved, the psychological impact on store personnel is well documented, supporting the court’s assessment of harm extending beyond mere material loss.

The Crown has acknowledged your limited prior convictions, though it must be noted these include at least three previous theft-related offences, the most recent dating from 2022. There is no evidence that you were subject to any court-imposed supervision or community order at the time of offending.

Sentencing Considerations  
These offences, though individually of low financial value, form part of a persistent pattern affecting multiple retailers and staff. This repetition, despite prior warnings and intervention opportunities, renders the offending particularly concerning. The court must emphasise the protective and deterrent functions of sentencing alongside the aims of rehabilitation.

The court is mindful of the social and personal factors mitigating culpability to some degree, as detailed in psychiatric and probation reports. That said, these do not displace the overarching necessity to impose a sentence that reflects the gravity of sustained acquisitive crime and its corrosive effect on community confidence.

While community penalties incorporating rehabilitative requirements are to be favoured where practicable, the balance here may well tip toward a custodial term, albeit one calibrated to the defendant’s circumstances.

The pre-sentence report is awaited and will play a critical role in evaluating prospects for rehabilitation, risk of reoffending, and the suitability of community-based interventions. The report will also inform the question of appropriate credit for your plea.

I reiterate that, while the court notes your engagement with some support services forthcoming in recent months, prior reluctance to make use of available resources has not gone unnoticed.

This court cannot endorse a stance of intermittent or selective engagement that undermines the holistic approach required for sustained desistance.

The sentencing hearing has proceeded in open court. I record my thanks to the staff of Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton for their professionalism and patience in managing the case, especially following the recent refurbishment of the court facilities, which has improved accessibility and working conditions for all participants.

The assistant legal advisers, ushers, and clerks have likewise facilitated the smooth conduct of proceedings.

This court is ardently aware that shoplifting is often trivialised as a crime lacking victims or significant consequences. Nothing could be further from the truth. The fear, uncertainty, and instability engendered among vulnerable retail workers must not be underestimated.

Nor can poverty or housing insecurity be accepted as a shield against responsibility. Financial hardship might explain conduct but cannot excuse it.

Accordingly, after weighing all factors, I adjourn sentencing to allow for the pre-sentence report and any further representations from the defence. I expect the report to be completed promptly to avoid further avoidable delay.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 18 September 2026, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Brighton. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of the right to appeal within 28 days, pursuant to sections 108 and 109 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 respectively. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged unless formally imposed. Costs are reserved to the trial judge.

These are the orders of the court.
