IN THE CROWN COURT AT MIDDLESBOROUGH  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/15893  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. D. MURRAY  
Filed: 17 October 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court today for sentencing on a charge of theft, specifically relating to repeated shoplifting incidents occurring over a significant period in the Middlesbrough area. The charge reflects a singular count but arises from a course of conduct that spans multiple offences across various commercial establishments, primarily concentrated in retail premises within the city centre and suburban shopping districts. The offences are, as outlined in the indictment, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968.

Procedural History and Court Context  
This case was initially lodged at the Magistrates’ Court on 1 July 2025, subsequent to which a committal order was made, and the matter transferred to the Crown Court for trial or plea. The prosecution elected to proceed by way of indictment, reflecting the seriousness with which these offences are viewed. The case has followed the protocols under the Better Case Management (BCM) scheme intended to expedite Crown Court proceedings and streamline case progression through proactive listing and disclosure management. Listed for a trial preparation hearing on 22 August 2025, the matter was anticipated to proceed smoothly; however, it was adjourned at the request of the defence to allow for the commissioning of a psychiatric report into your mental health and decision-making capacity. That report was duly submitted by Dr L. Hetherington, consultant forensic psychologist, whose detailed observations will be addressed in due course.

The BCM framework represents an advance from prior case progression methodologies that were frequently criticised for inefficiency and delay. Since its implementation, this court has noted an increase in the timeliness of hearings and the improved quality of case papers. Nonetheless, the pressure on court resources remains intense, exacerbated by staffing limitations in court listing departments and fluctuating availability of Legal Aid funding. You will be aware, Mr H, that the system is strained—this case is no exception.

Notably, the Legal Aid Agency has once again demonstrated cumbersome administrative processes in this matter. The defence’s early plea for funding to instruct an independent mental health expert languished for over three months before resolution. This appears symptomatic of a deep-rooted dysfunction in the administration of justice support systems, particularly in cases involving suspected underlying vulnerability. The knock-on effect was to prolong the pre-sentence process, an outcome which neither serves public interest nor defendants’ rights.

Before turning to the facts and substance of the offending, I must record the efforts of local charities and community organisations who have submitted written representations on your behalf. In particular, the North Tees Food Justice Collective and Middlesbrough Homeless Action Group provided thoughtful commentary on the hardships faced by those in precarious housing, which, while not determinative, contribute to the broader context in which your offending took place. Such bodies operate under immense pressure, bereft of long-term funding and often reliant on volunteers who themselves face challenging circumstances. Their involvement highlights the intersectional difficulties present in many acquisitive crime cases and warrants commensurate recognition.

It bears mention that the Crown herein has been represented by Ms Emily Stanton, whose careful engagement with the evidence ensured a clear and coherent presentation of the prosecution’s position. On your behalf, Mr Gregory Ashford, instructed under a Crown Court Representation Order, conducted himself with suitable professionalism despite the constraints imposed by delayed funding and limited preparation time.

An adjunct to this hearing is the recent refurbishment of Court 5’s facilities, marking an investment into infrastructure aimed at improving judicial and public access. That such capital expenditure is undertaken, while welcome, contrasts sharply with longstanding under-resourcing of probation and rehabilitation services. One may not conflate these matters, but their juxtaposition is a reminder of competing priorities in criminal justice budgets.

Legal Framework and Appellate Guidance  
The charge before us invokes section 1 of the Theft Act 1968, which defines theft as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with intent to permanently deprive. The thefts here involved items generally characterised as consumer goods and pharmaceuticals, albeit with varied values.

The Sentencing Council guidelines for theft offences provide a matrix that accounts for factors including the value of the goods taken, the sophistication of the offending, and the impact on victims and the wider community. Mr H, the court must assess culpability and harm holistically, not merely as discrete isolated instances.

Several appellate authorities inform our approach. Notably, R v. O’Connor [2019] EWCA Crim 324 reflects on the relationship between repeated thefts, the onset of offending behaviour, and the court’s duty to tailor sentencing to an offender’s prospects for rehabilitation. Meanwhile, R v. Crawford [2022] EWCA Crim 1171 delineates the threshold for credit reduction where pleas are entered late; to the extent you admitted guilt at the plea hearing on 10 October 2025, Mr H, this court must consider the degree to which that admission facilitated the efficient administration of justice.

I would also draw attention to R v. Fountain [2020] EWCA Crim 2024, which concerned thefts from a single retail outlet’s charity bins. While factually distinct, the judgment underscored the psychological harm suffered by retail staff when theft was persistent and undermined workplace morale. Such intangible harm is sometimes overlooked but is no less a valid sentencing consideration.

Moreover, cases such as R v. Gills [2018] EWCA Crim 1433 shed light on the interplay between dependency disorders and offence causation. The Court in Gills affirmed that while addiction may inform sentencers’ understanding, it does not absolve responsibility or negate the need to impose deterrent sentences.

Operational Policing and Investigative Efforts  
You were apprehended on 14 September 2025 following a coordinated initiative between the Cleveland Police Retail Crime Unit and the Middlesbrough Business Crime Partnership. This partnership synthesises intelligence from local businesses, law enforcement, and social services, aiming to identify and disrupt repeat offenders swiftly.

The investigative phase incorporated the use of multi-agency CCTV analysis, covert observation, and mobile device seizure pursuant to judicial warrants. It is important for the record to note that such work demands significant resource allocation. Surveillance and forensic examination, even for low-value offences, place strain on digital forensics teams concurrently tasked with serious and organised crime investigations.

It is illustrative that while your conduct did not trigger emergency law enforcement measures, the cumulative burden — from officer time to victim liaison — is considerable given the serial nature of your offending. The public cost of such repeat shop theft, in aggregated losses to commerce and service disruption, cannot be lightly discounted.

Consideration must also be given to the fact that the Business Crime Partnership in this locale has faced personnel constraints, which have on occasion delayed real-time responsive efforts. This court acknowledges the professionalism shown by the officers involved despite operational strain.

Consumer Services Impact and Victim Statements  
Victim impact statements have been submitted from a variety of retail premises, including two national supermarket chains and the Middlesbrough Corner Pharmacy. The store managers provide testimony both to financial loss and emotional toll on their employees. Staff described anxiety, altered shift patterns to mitigate lone working, and an erosion of workplace confidence in the face of your repeated presence.

Although no direct threat or violence was recorded, these statements reflect a palpable atmosphere of apprehension. It is recognised that in numerous prior cases, such cumulative effects have led to decreased staff retention and increased overall operating costs.

Victim liaison officers have ensured that affected businesses were both supported and informed throughout the investigative and prosecutorial phases. It is proper to commend their unwavering efforts amidst increasing workloads exacerbated by national shortages of qualified detectives.

It should, however, be noted for completeness that the East Cleveland Chamber of Commerce suffered a separate incident of commercial damage unrelated to you, involving fly-tipping of construction debris in a greenbelt boundary area, which generated substantial local media interest. While unconnected, this episode contributed to a heightened sense of vulnerability within the business community at the time of your offending.

Defendant’s Personal Circumstances and Background  
You are 31 years old, residing in temporary accommodation provided through the Middlesbrough Housing Authority. You report a history of periods of unemployment and a complex relationship with family support networks. Your record discloses prior convictions for similar offences: two for shoplifting committed in 2021 and a community resolution in 2023 following an incident involving an attempted theft of mobile phone accessories.

A psychiatric evaluation commissioned by the defence, dated 5 October 2025, has been submitted by Dr Hetherington. While no severe mental illness was diagnosed, the report highlights traits consistent with impulsivity and low mood, possibly exacerbated by sub-threshold depressive symptoms and episodic alcohol misuse. Dr Hetherington notes a reluctance on your part to engage consistently with support services, despite offers extended by probation liaison officers.

The report makes recommendations for a structured community-based intervention incorporating cognitive-behavioural therapy aimed at impulse control and financial management. It is observed that a failure to address these underlying issues increases the risk of reoffending, necessitating close supervisory input.

The report also remarks upon your stated motivation for offending as rooted in financial difficulty, but notes insufficient engagement with available assistance, such as emergency food banks and debt advisory charities. This pattern of limited uptake despite widespread local provision is acknowledged but not excused.

It is relevant that the national probation service coverage in your borough has been subject to recent significant cutbacks, with increased caseloads for officers and delays in assessment procedures. This systemic shortfall poses challenges for effective rehabilitation across cases.

In reviewing your educational history, the court is advised that you left school at 16, with no formal qualifications, and minimal vocational training. This disadvantage further constrains employment prospects but again does not diminish personal accountability.

It is regrettable, though not unprecedented, that your familial network is reportedly fragmented, with a sibling currently implicated in an unrelated fraud investigation involving benefit claims. Such matters, while perhaps germane to family dynamics, are peripheral to the matter at hand.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}.  

Upon initial remand, you declined offers to participate in voluntary restorative justice sessions facilitated by the Middlesbrough Community Mediation Service. While participation is never obligatory, this refusal denies an opportunity for direct engagement with those affected by your actions.

The court is aware of a co-defendant in an unrelated case involving criminal damage to a church noticeboard in North Ormesby, charged concurrently before a different bench. That individual’s conduct and sentence have no bearing on your case.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

It is reported that your accommodation is in a tower block subject to multiple noise abatement notices issued to the landlord in recent months, unrelated to your tenancy. These disturbances, however, contribute to a generally unstable residential environment.

On the question of previous rehabilitation measures, you were subject to a community order in 2022 that incorporated an unpaid work requirement, successfully completed without incident. It is unclear, however, whether the interventions accessed at that time provided sufficient tools to change offending behaviour.

Protective Measures and Risk Management  
The pre-sentence report requested by this court will consider risk of reoffending in detail, particularly the viability of any custodial versus community sentence. This assessment will include potential for structured domestic monitoring, electronic tagging, or enhanced probation supervision.

Given the relatively low value of goods stolen individually, but the sustained pattern of offending, the court must weigh denunciation and deterrence alongside rehabilitation. The approach taken must be proportionate, mindful both of personal circumstances and public interest.

This court is conscious that neighbourhood policing teams are increasingly burdened with responding to non-serious acquisitive crime, diverting resources from violent incident investigations. The steady rise in shoplifting reports in Middlesbrough mirrors national trends and challenges policing and judicial systems alike.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}.  

A cross-reference must be made to the recent judgment in R v. Jamal [2024] EWCA Crim 876, which highlighted that repeated shoplifting by defendants facing housing insecurity merits custodial orders where non-custodial options have been exhausted. That case involved theft of electronic goods within designated “no-street-entry” zones as part of a curfew restriction—features absent here but nonetheless instructive.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}.  

This court also notes the growing influence of social media in shaping public perceptions of justice. The defendant, unlike others subject to widely disseminated footage of offences, did not generate significant online attention. The absence of such external pressure neither mitigates nor aggravates culpability but speaks to the quiet, attritional nature of offending reflected in these proceedings.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.  

Additional Considerations and Public Service Input  
Regarding ancillary services, I note correspondence received from the Middlesbrough Retail Staff Welfare Alliance. Their letter expresses deep concern at the cumulative impact of repeated petty theft on frontline workers and encourages the court to impose sentences of sufficient severity to protect staff confidence.

Furthermore, the local branch of the Probation Service draws attention to structural understaffing that limits rehabilitative engagement rates nationwide. The government’s recently announced funding package to bolster frontline probation services, although welcome, will not take effect until 2026.

Operational reality demands that courts manage offender cohorts aware of the limitations imposed not by law but by resource paucity. This is neither excuse nor explanation, merely context.

Despite the relative gravity of this case, it must be recalled that the criminal record check reveals no violent offences or firearms possessions connected to your history. This fact, while positive, reflects avoidance rather than an absence of harm.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

It is further observed that your lifestyle includes periodic transient accommodation, and that on one occasion, goods from an unrelated residential burglary in a nearby suburb were found among items seized during police search of a friend’s apartment. No direct link to you was established, and the co-resident is subject to separate proceedings.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

Lastly, I acknowledge a letter written by a local charity outreach worker commending your polite demeanour when accessing food assistance, though lamenting your refusal to engage with complementary services that might aid stability.

Sentencing Approach and Next Steps  
The court is tasked with imposing a sentence that reflects the seriousness of your repeated dishonesty, the impact upon victims, and your prospects for rehabilitation, while also affording suitable consideration to your mental health and personal circumstances.

All mitigating and aggravating factors must be balanced. It is apparent that community-based interventions offer some prospect of addressing underlying issues, particularly if augmented by comprehensive probation supervision and cognitive skills development.

However, the persistence of offending despite previous warnings and interventions must weigh heavily against leniency. The court emphasises the need for a clear deterrent message while avoiding unnecessary custody where suitable alternatives exist.

I will, accordingly, direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report incorporating an up-to-date risk assessment and full psychological evaluation. This report shall explore the feasibility of available rehabilitative pathways, including potential referral to supported housing schemes, financial counselling, and substance misuse programmes.

It is appropriate to adjourn for this purpose, with a view to return for sentence once the report is received and considered by the court.

These sentencing remarks are issued this 17th day of October 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Middlesbrough. The proceedings have been transcribed and recorded pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The formal record of conviction and sentence will be transmitted to the relevant agencies for notification. You are hereby advised of your right to appeal the sentence within 28 days in accordance with sections 108 and 112 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions pursuant to section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 are engaged. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
