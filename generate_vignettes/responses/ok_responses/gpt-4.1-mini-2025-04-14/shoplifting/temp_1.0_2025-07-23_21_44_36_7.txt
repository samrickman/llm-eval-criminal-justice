IN THE CROWN COURT AT MANCHESTER  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. M2025/14159  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge R. J. Carmichael  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following a conviction for several offences of theft from retail premises, specifically shoplifting, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. Your offending behaviour encompasses a period from November 2023 through to February 2025, with crimes committed primarily across various commercial districts in Greater Manchester, including Old Trafford and Salford Quays.

Procedural History  
Your initial arrest occurred on 10 February 2025, following an exhaustive investigation by officers attached to the Greater Manchester Police’s Commercial Crime Unit, in collaboration with the Manchester Business Crime Reduction Partnership. The joint operation was activated after multiple independent reports from boutique retailers, convenience stores, and a pharmacy chain began to reveal behavioural patterns indicative of repeated targeting by an individual matching your description. Although early complaints were often lodged as seemingly isolated incidents, it became evident upon collation that a concerted course of offending was in process.  

Cases such as yours often highlight the challenges endemic to prosecuting serial shoplifting offences. The gathering and synthesis of surveillance footage, staff testimonies, and digital transaction records require painstaking effort. The Criminal Procedure Rules and the Better Case Management (BCM) framework mandate efficient case progression, yet in practice, numerous jurisdictional and logistical hurdles persist. Many retailers lack dedicated resources to follow through with prosecutions, and the burden of producing voluminous disclosure material can strain already stretched police and Crown Prosecution Service operations. Nevertheless, the state has a fiduciary duty to uphold commerce integrity and protect law-abiding citizens from cumulative harm.

You were interviewed on 11 February 2025. During that interview, you exercised your right to remain silent initially but admitted participation in several incidents upon presentation of detailed CCTV evidence and witness statements. A preferral of twelve counts of theft were served on 20 February 2025, later consolidated to a single representative count to streamline trial preparation and focus on the overarching course of conduct.

The Better Case Management process was adhered to with reasonable expedition: a Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing was convened on 28 March 2025. Your counsel, Mr Philip Warrington of Barrister’s Chambers, applied for additional time to obtain a psychiatric evaluation and gather supplementary character references, which the court granted, mindful of the importance of a fair hearing.

It is noted, however, that delays attributable to Legal Aid Administrative processing impeded the prompt receipt of authority to instruct a forensic psychiatrist. Such obstacles, though procedural in nature, have tangible consequences for case timeliness and the rights of defendants. This court reiterates its ongoing concern with the efficiency of the Legal Aid system in facilitating effective defence inquiries, a sentiment echoed in previous judgments including R v. Collins [2024] EWCA Crim 927.  

At the plea hearing initially scheduled for 2 July 2025, you entered a not guilty plea but subsequently altered your position to a guilty plea at the close of the Crown’s evidential case on 15 August 2025. This timing is regrettable, though not uncommon, and will be factored accordingly in sentencing decision-making.

The context of your plea is relevant. The principle of early guilty plea, as enshrined in the Sentencing Council guideline and exemplified in R v. Weller [2022] EWCA Crim 1670, permits an offender to receive credit for the reduction of court time and victim distress. A plea entered at a late stage, however, limits such reduction, given the additional resource and emotional costs thereby incurred.

It is instructive here to recognise, despite occasional perceptions to the contrary, that shoplifting offences are far from victimless. Members of the court, police, and community alike are familiar with accounts from retail staff and proprietors who endure not only economic loss but a diminution in their sense of workplace safety. The impact on their emotional well-being and operational stability cannot be lightly dismissed.

Prior to addressing the substantive facts, I must canvass the recent jurisprudential developments pertinent to theft sentencing. Notably, although section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 remains the substantive statutory provision, evolving interpretative principles assigned weight to contextual harm, offender culpability, and patterns of offending in the Sentencing Council's Definitive Guideline on Theft and Fraud (2020 edition). The court is guided accordingly, balancing deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection.

Historical case law continues to offer illumination, though with caveat. R v. Calder [2023] EWCA Crim 1122 tolerated a custodial sentence for persistent petty thefts motivated by addiction, underscoring courts’ increasing willingness to impose significant sentences when offences indicate recidivism and disregard for prior sanctions. Meanwhile, R v. Spencer [2019] EWCA Crim 757 discussed the nuanced role of credit for early plea, particularly advising judicial restraint in cases featuring last-minute admissions.

Beyond shoplifting law, peripheral cases sometimes inform sentencing, albeit with circumspection. For example, R v. Hunter [2021] EWCA Crim 1435 concerned aggravated burglary involving violence and was cited in argument for sentencing principles relating to harm calculation, notwithstanding its evident factual divergence. Similarly, reference was made by prosecution counsel to R v. Larkin [2022] EWCA Crim 991 on fraudulent misrepresentation, serving only to sketch general legal principles on dishonesty rather than direct application here.

I acknowledge receipt of comprehensive victim impact statements from a number of the affected premises. These documents, compiled by the Manchester Retail Liaison Service, articulate the tangible economic losses sustained and, critically, the psychological toll on staff—some of whom expressed heightened anxiety and concern following repeat incidents attributed to you. Reports indicate staffing adjustments, including reduction of lone working and changes to shift patterns, arising directly from apprehensions about your recurrent presence.

Victim commentary reiterates the broader societal issue: persistent shoplifting feeds into a spiralling cycle of increased prices, security expenditure, and deteriorating community relations. While the individual acts may appear small, their accumulative effect is profound. In recognition of the extensive police and prosecution efforts mounted to address such offending — including detailed forensic analysis, collation of video evidence, and deployment of investigators — the court acknowledges the public interest in a resolute sentencing outcome.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

In considering the social context, it is pertinent to remark upon the pressures currently facing public services, including probation officers and mental health providers. At the time this case was listed, the local Probation Service reported significant caseload backlogs, which risk delaying rehabilitation interventions. Concurrently, NHS patients on waiting lists for psychological counselling now number in excess of 40,000 in Greater Manchester alone, illustrating capacity constraints that hamper timely support.

Such systemic challenges underscore why courts must carefully calibrate sentencing: custodial sentences may disrupt community ties and service engagement but may also provide authoritative impetus for treatment and behavioural correction where community measures have failed.  

Particular thanks are due to Probation Officer Ms Aisha Burke for her detailed pre-sentence enquiries and for compiling a risk assessment report which will assist in formulating sentence proposals. Her observations include a measured evaluation of both criminogenic factors and protective features, highlighting your expressed willingness to engage with substance misuse support programs although with equivocation noted.

Your defence team has submitted multiple letters attesting to your character. Among them is a statement from your sister, Ms Laurene H., who contends that your offending arose, in part, from enduring economic hardship and social isolation. Further letters received from staff at the Hope Outreach Centre commend your intermittent attendance at drop-in sessions aimed at improving financial literacy and emotional resilience. Such input, while mitigatory, cannot overshadow the gravity of the offences.

I am also mindful that you have prior convictions for theft, some dating back approximately six years. Your criminal record, as disclosed in the Prosecution Disclosure Schedule dated 31 July 2025, includes incidents not linked to violence or weapon possession but indicative of a noted predilection toward acquisitive crime. There are no previous convictions for offences against the person or for drug supply, which is material in assessing your risk profile.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

Expert psychiatric evidence was procured at your request. Dr Graham Petters, consultant forensic psychiatrist, provided a nuanced report dated 20 August 2025. The document records no diagnosis of major mental disorder but notes “a constellation of mild depressive symptoms compounded by socioeconomic stress.” Dr Petters emphasised the absence of psychotic features or cognitive impairment.

More germane, Dr Petters remarked upon “a tendency toward impulsivity and deficient coping mechanisms” in your behaviour, which might contribute to repetitive offending absent robust therapeutic engagement. Recommendations included consideration of cognitive behavioural therapy oriented interventions to address underlying cognitive distortions relating to entitlement and decision-making under stress.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Attention is drawn to the fact that prior diversionary efforts — including community resolutions and caution warnings offered by community policing teams — have not secured long-term behavioural change. This court has witnessed that pattern before and understands all too well the difficulties experienced by individuals trapped in cycles of acquisitive offending against the backdrop of unresolved personal and economic challenges.

It must be recorded, however, that your reported refusal to attend several appointments with local employment support schemes diminishes the prospects for rehabilitation absent enforced measures. While it is neither the court’s role nor inclination to coerced attendance, persistent disengagement evidences a lack of proactive responsibility that weighs against leniency.

In the wider context of public safety, though your crimes do not involve violent threat or weapons, it is an error to trivialise the cumulative community harm wrought by repeated shoplifting. Losses to small businesses, the psychological impact on employees, and the eventual deterrent cost to the wider public funded security measures all represent societal burdens that justify sentencing proportionate to offence and offender culpability.

The court regrets that such cases draw scarce resources away from serious crime investigation. Specialist police units, already contending with persistent violent and gang-related criminality, frequently allocate considerable time and expertise to shoplifting investigations owing to the fractal and high-volume nature of these offences.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Drawing upon the sentencing framework enunciated in the Theft Act 1968 and recent guidelines, the court carefully weighs aggravating and mitigating factors. Aggravation stems from the persistence of offending despite opportunities to cease; targeting of multiple premises; and the distress caused to victims and business operators.

Mitigating features include absence of violent behaviour or weapons; no evidence of hate crime or discrimination; your late guilty plea; and engagement, albeit limited, with support services. Further mitigation is found in your reported adverse personal circumstances, including precarious housing and unstable employment history.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

Before concluding, I should address a series of peripheral but notable references made during submissions. For example, counsel cited R v. Bains [2023] EWCA Crim 1805 concerning possession of a bladed article in a school car park. While certainly serious, such incidents are manifestly unrelated to this matter and thus hold no direct bearing on your case. Similarly, there were allusions to a co-defendant in an unrelated affray at a nearby licensed premises involving pool cues; that co-accused’s conduct is not attributable to you.

Some mention was made of a recent case of fly-tipping on green belt land in Cheshire, resulting in environmental harm and subsequent community service order. While unacceptable, this offence differs fundamentally in nature and context, thus offering no useful comparative insights here.

These diversions underscore a common phenomenon in trial advocacy and reporting—the temptation to draw on high-profile or sensational cases which may not align with the facts before the court. However, sentencing must remain tethered to the particularities of this defendant and his offending.

In conclusion, Mr H, having considered all pertinent material — including your antecedents, current circumstances, expert evaluations, victim impact, and the statutory framework — I reserve full sentencing pending receipt of a detailed pre-sentence report from probation. That report should provide an updated evaluation of risk, suitability for community rehabilitation programmes, and the potential for restorative justice measures.

I am mindful that such reports are indispensable to crafting a proportionate sentence—one that seeks not only to mark the seriousness of your offending, but also to promote rehabilitation and reduce reoffending risk. The probation service’s insights into your social circumstances, family support, and psychological state will be critical in this regard.

These sentencing remarks are issued this day, 14 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Manchester. Proceedings have been recorded in compliance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. You are advised of your statutory right to appeal within 28 days, pursuant to section 108 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
