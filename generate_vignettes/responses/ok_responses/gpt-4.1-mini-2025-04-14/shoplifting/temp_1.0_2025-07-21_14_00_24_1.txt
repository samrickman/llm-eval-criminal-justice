IN THE CROWN COURT AT BELMONT  
R v. MR H  
Case No. BLM2025/02875  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge L. K. Fenwick  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court today for sentence following your conviction on a representative count of theft, charged under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences in question consist of multiple opportunistic and repeated shoplifting incidents across several commercial establishments located primarily within the Belmont and Eaton districts. The offending period spans from early 2023 through to April 2025, involving goods predominantly retailing at modest values but cumulatively significant in the impact upon the stores and communities affected.

Procedural Background  
You were apprehended on 22 April 2025 after an intensive, multi-agency inquiry led by Belmont Police’s Economic Crime Unit, working in concert with the Retail Crime Prevention Partnership and supplemented by expert digital analysts from the Midlands Regional Forensic Service. The investigation was precipitated by a discernible pattern of thefts associated with a distinctive physical appearance and behavioural profile repeatedly captured on closed-circuit television and through detailed staff reports from various retail locations. The resources mobilised for this inquiry were substantial, involving surveillance operations, multiple witness interviews, and forensic analysis of recovered property. Such an endeavour reflects the significant administrative and financial burdens intrinsic to pursuing low-level acquisitive crime at scale.

It is pertinent to record that the court acknowledges the ongoing strain upon public services occasioned by such investigations. Police forces nationwide, including Belmont, report escalating demands on Economic Crime Units, which must balance their attention between these resource-draining matters and the pressing challenge of more serious offences, such as violent crime and organised criminality. Moreover, the Retail Crime Prevention Partnership, despite operating with a modest team and shrinking budgets, has demonstrated commendable persistence in collating intelligence, facilitating victim statements, and fostering communication between affected businesses and law enforcement.

The administrative journey of this matter has not been without complication. Initial listings were deferred due to adjournments arising from defence applications for expert psychiatric assessment funding, which, as is too often the case, encountered protracted delays in approval from the Legal Aid Authority. These delays, spanning a period of six weeks, impeded the timely progression of the case. The court reiterates its concern regarding the systemic inefficiencies of that body, which impose unnecessary obstacles to defendants’ access to expert guidance and therefore, indirectly, to the efficient administration of justice.

A plea and trial preparation hearing was set down for 10 July 2025; at this time, you entered a not guilty plea. Subsequent to the disclosure of further statements, video material, and forensic evidence, you altered your position and tendered a guilty plea on 24 August 2025, the date upon which this court now proceeds to sentencing. The late nature of your admission is, regrettably, reflective of a trend seen in a substantial volume of comparable cases. Whilst the law rightly permits defendants the opportunity to test the evidence, the court must suitably weigh the timing of pleas when considering reductions. As was stated in R v. Thompson [2023] EWCA Crim 765, the Court of Appeal confirmed that “the discount afforded for a guilty plea is a matter for the judge, informed by the plea’s promptness and sincerity.” Your plea, entered only shortly before the sentencing hearing, attracts less generous consideration.

In understanding the framework within which sentencing is to be undertaken, reference is hereby made to the Sentencing Council Guideline on Theft Offences (published 2019, latest update 2024), which instructs the court to consider the offending’s nature, the degree of planning or sophistication, the harm—both economic and psychological—and any mitigating features such as remorse or personal circumstances. While your offences were non-violent, the guideline acknowledges the cumulative toll that persistent shoplifting exacts on victims, staff morale, and local business viability.

Additionally, the court recalls the observations made in R v. Marlow [2020] EWCA Crim 1623 wherein the Court accentuated that repeated thefts from vulnerable retailers, including small independent shops and pharmacies, often generate a distinctive pattern of harm notwithstanding the modest value of each individual theft. The aggregate effect is to create apprehension among staff and, at times, a tangible contraction of service provision. Similar sentiments were expressed in R v. Yates [2021] EWCA Crim 927, reinforcing the principle that sentences should be commensurate not solely with monetary loss but with the broader social ramifications. Although these authorities involve different factual matrices, their underlying principles provide helpful guidance.

It is also of note that the Better Case Management (BCM) Protocol was engaged in this matter from an early stage. The procedural intends of BCM—to optimise timetables, disclosure, and resource allocation—were adhered to earnestly by the parties, with listings conducted within prescribed windows save for delays attributable to expert report procurement and pandemic-related court capacity limitations. The court is mindful of the persistent challenges confronting the judicial system, including the effects of ongoing staff shortages among court clerks and ushers, which have, on occasion, delayed the commencement of proceedings and the availability of courtrooms equipped with appropriate technological support for video evidence playback.

Aside from the core criminal proceedings, the court has received written representations from several support agencies, including the Belmont Foodbank Partnership and the Southside Voluntary Resource Centre, both of which have outlined the limited but meaningful engagement efforts extended to you over the past twelve months. They report your sporadic attendance at drop-in sessions, inconsistent uptake of advisory services for budgeting and mental wellbeing, and the challenges faced by frontline workers in establishing sustained contact.

While the immediate offence constitutes the primary focus, it is incumbent on the court to consider contextual elements beyond the bare facts. The patterns of shoplifting seen in recent years often intersect with broader societal issues, including housing insecurity, escalating cost of living, and evolving local retail landscapes that have seen a diminution of staffing levels, shortened operating hours, and the installation of automated self-service tills. All these factors, while peripheral to the instant matter, serve to illustrate the environment within which conduct such as yours arises.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}.  

Regarding co-defendant involvement, the court is tasked solely with adjudicating your own culpability. It is noted in passing that a co-defendant in a connected matter remains at large following a failure to appear at previous listings and is under active investigation. The presence of co-defendants does not mitigate your conduct but does reflect the complex social networks that can underpin acquisitive crime in certain sectors.

The victim impact statements received from managers and retail staff have been candid and measured. One particular store manager noted that repeated thefts had led to adjustments in staffing rotas, with some employees requesting transfers or reduction in hours due to anxiety related to encounters with offenders. Another commented on the emotional labour expended in remaining vigilant and maintaining customer service standards amid the threat of theft and occasional verbal abuse. Such effects, while intangible, are no less real.

Turning to expert evidence, Dr Marianne Giles, Consultant Forensic Psychologist, produced a thorough report dated 1 September 2025, including the results of psychometric assessments and clinical interviews conducted over two sessions. Dr Giles’ conclusion was that you present with no diagnosable major psychiatric disorder but exhibit traits indicative of impulse control difficulties, low frustration tolerance, and mild substance misuse, principally alcohol dependence noted as intermittent but problematic. These features, combined with a stable but fragile social network, may contribute to a heightened risk of recidivism absent intervention.

The absence of a severe mental illness aligns with probation reports from Ms Caroline Reid, Principal Probation Officer, who notes your limited engagement with voluntary sector programs and reluctance to embrace support designed to address offending behaviour, such as cognitive skills workshops and financial advice clinics. While Ms Reid acknowledges systemic challenges—including heavy caseloads and limited resources in the residential support sector—she emphasises that your case particularly illustrates the frustration encountered when potential rehabilitative mechanisms are underutilised or resisted. It is a compelling admonition that services, however well-intentioned, rely fundamentally upon recipient cooperation.

The court has also considered precedent set in the recent appellate decisions of R v. Bellamy [2024] EWCA Crim 322, involving a defendant convicted of repeated theft from a supermarket chain, and R v. Jacobs [2023] EWCA Crim 1640, addressing similar repeated shoplifting offences committed in close proximity to protected housing for vulnerable adults. Both cases emphasised deterrence, particularly recognising the cumulative economic impact and psychological harm associated with such offending patterns, even where physical violence was absent and property value low.

In parallel, it is instructive to acknowledge the implications of R v. Sham [2021] EWCA Crim 1185, concerning a defendant convicted of disparagement and criminal damage at a charity shop, where differential application of sentencing principles highlighted how the context of offending — and associated public interest — bears heavily on outcome severity. The justices in Sham underscored that offences against smaller community-oriented businesses may attract enhanced scrutiny, reflecting their limited capacity to absorb financial loss.

From a statistical perspective, crime data provided by the Belmont Metropolitan Illustrative Crime Panel reflects a persistently elevated incidence of low-level retail theft over the past five years. These offences have risen by 12% since 2020, a phenomenon partly attributed to changing economic conditions, including welfare reforms that have disproportionately affected urban centres. The socio-economic context is germane but cannot excuse individual accountability.

It is appropriate too to reflect upon the evolution of the Theft Act 1968, as initially enacted, and subsequent legislative refinements, including the Theft (Amendment) Act 1996 and other statutory instruments modifying sentencing powers. This framework balances the protection of property rights with proportionality in penalty, a principle fundamental to the rule of law.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}.  

An ancillary consideration is the effect of your offending on public perceptions of safety and commerce in the affected locales. Anecdotal evidence, including commentary recorded by community policing officers, indicates a degree of wariness among residents and business proprietors. The normalization of petty theft can, over time, erode trust and undercut the willingness of citizens to invest in local trade.

The court has also duly noted your personal circumstances: you are 34 years of age, with a previous record containing multiple convictions for similar offences, including cautionary disposals and a community order imposed in 2021. You have experienced periods of homelessness, currently residing in temporary accommodation provided by the Belmont Housing Partnership. Family support is reportedly limited, though letters received from a sibling and an aunt express hope for your rehabilitation and stress your longstanding struggles with employment and addiction.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.  

Procedure has required the court also to consider victim’s cohabitants and collateral witnesses, some of whom have submitted statements reflecting indirect impacts, though these are not prima facie linked to your conduct. One such correspondent — the flatmate of a shop manager — made complaints regarding noise disturbances unrelated to the offences before the court. This material, while noted, carries no evidentiary weight in regard to sentencing.

Furthermore, digital forensic investigators involved in the case have remarked on the increasing workload imposed by extracting usable evidence from automated check-out systems, the data logs of which are frequently incomplete or corrupted by system errors. These operational challenges further complicate prosecutions in theft matters, adding hidden layers of complexity to seemingly straightforward offences.

Turning finally to submissions made by counsel, the Crown prosecutor has emphasised the need for deterrence, highlighting the established pattern of offending despite prior community-based interventions, and the inadequacy of previous sentences to effect change. The prosecution submits that custodial sentences, coupled with rehabilitative requirements, would better protect the public.

Defence counsel has urged the court to consider your personal difficulties, late plea, and the absence of physical harm or threats in mitigation. Additionally, reliance has been placed upon the psychiatric assessment’s findings and community support letters advocating for a community order featuring structured treatment and monitoring. The defence argues that engagement with suitable rehabilitation programs would materially reduce the risk of reoffending.

It is worth reflecting upon the persistent difficulties confronting the public sector in securing meaningful interventions for individuals caught in cycles of acquisitive offending. Probation services, social care providers, and mental health services alike report insufficient capacity, exacerbated by funding cuts and increased demand. This systemic challenge, while not excusing individual culpability, frames the wider context of your case.

As a matter of judicial observation, there have been advances in integrated offender management schemes that combine criminal justice oversight with health and social support, yet practical implementation remains variable across territories. For your part, engagement with such services has been intermittent.

The court, having taken comprehensive account of all evidence, reports, and submissions, remains cognisant of the need to impose a sentence that strikes a balance between public protection, individual rehabilitation, and the wider interests of justice.

I hereby order the preparation of a pre-sentence report, instructing probation officers to assess the viability of a custodial sentence suspended in whole or in part, alongside targeted Community Rehabilitation Programmes encompassing cognitive skills training, substance misuse interventions, and social reintegration strategies.

I further direct the report to consider the potential utility of restorative justice processes, where feasible, and to make recommendations in respect of curfew requirements or electronically monitored home detention, dependent on your circumstances.

These sentencing remarks are pronounced this 14th day of September 2025 in Court 5 of the Crown Court at Belmont. The record complies with the Criminal Procedure Rules, Part 5. You are advised of your right to appeal within 28 days pursuant to the provisions of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions under section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 apply unless otherwise ordered. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
