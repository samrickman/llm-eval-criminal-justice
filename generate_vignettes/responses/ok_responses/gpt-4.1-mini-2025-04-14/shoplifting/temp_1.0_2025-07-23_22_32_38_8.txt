IN THE CROWN COURT AT NOTTINGHAM  
R v. MR H  
Case No. N2025/14398  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge D. P. Whitmore  
Filed: 18 October 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced following your conviction for shoplifting offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. These offences form part of a course of conduct traversing an eighteen-month period ending in the early months of 2025 and are characterised by repeated thefts targeting a variety of retail outlets across Nottinghamshire and adjoining areas.

Procedural History and Context  
Your arrest on 10 March 2025 marked the conclusion of an extensive investigation conducted jointly by Nottinghamshire Police’s Commercial Crime Unit and local business associations within the East Midlands Business Crime Initiative. The investigation was precipitated by rising reports from convenience store operators and pharmacy proprietors, who noted a disturbing prevalence of losses attributed to an individual matching your description. The convergence of evidence leading to your identification was a product of methodical collation of CCTV footage, transaction anomalies, and detailed witness statements. The protracted nature of the inquiry, involving upwards of 15 officers across various teams and shifts, is indicative of the deployment of significant public resources.

It is a regrettable reality that such cases, while classified administratively as 'low harm,' can consume disproportionate police time — detracting focus from other pressing demands on law enforcement such as violent crime and organised drug trafficking. The complexity of such investigations is often underestimated outside professional circles. Moreover, the increasingly digitised retail environment has introduced both new tools and new challenges; sophisticated point-of-sale data analysis aids detection, but also demands resource-intensive cross-validation and forensic scrutiny, particularly where claims of denial are made.

In the present matter, liaison with the Nottinghamshire Business Crime Reduction Partnership (BCRP) was a vital procedural component. The BCRP’s coordinated efforts enabled the sharing of intelligence between affected retailers, facilitating rapid reporting and the identification of patterns indicating single offender involvement. Whilst such partnerships embody best practice, the court recognises ongoing limitations born of budgetary constraints and staff shortages. It is thus somewhat heartening that here, the mechanisms of multi-agency information-sharing appear to have functioned without the customary bureaucratic delay.

The case progressed under the auspices of the Better Case Management (BCM) protocols, designed to streamline preparatory phases and promote early resolution. Hearings have been held on 12 May and 16 September 2025, with the latter adjourned to permit the completion of a psychiatric assessment. Delays occasioned by late provision of defence materials and the rescheduling of expert reports have regrettably extended proceedings beyond initial projections, but such occurrences are not unusual in the current climate of stretched court resources.

It warrants mention that Legal Aid authorisations required to instruct a forensic clinical psychologist were sought on 18 August but approved only on 4 September following extensive correspondence between defence solicitors and the Legal Aid Agency. These procedural hurdles — now so frequent in criminal defence work — represent a concerning impediment to the timely administration of justice.

The court’s awareness extends beyond this specific case, recognising the systemic pressures faced by the probation service and mental health practitioners in the East Midlands. Current staffing levels lag behind demand, particularly specialist practitioners skilled in assessing and managing offenders with complex psychosocial needs and histories of acquisitive offending. This has direct bearing on the availability and timeliness of reports, assessments, and tailored intervention programmes, elements critical for both judicial decision-making and offender rehabilitation.

In line with this, the assistance provided by Nottinghamshire Probation Trust in preparing the pre-sentence report is gratefully acknowledged. Of particular note is the Probation Officer’s detailed account documenting your engagement—or lack thereof—with voluntary support structures, financial management schemes, and drug and alcohol services operating within the local authority framework.

Case Law and Sentencing Principles  
Turning to legal precedents, it is instructive to consider the guidance encapsulated in the Theft Act and reflected in appellate authorities. The fundamental statutory test remains the dishonest appropriation with the intention to permanently deprive. Though commonplace in appearance, shoplifting poses distinct concerns due to its cumulative impact on commerce, staff welfare, and community confidence.

In R v. Clements [2023] EWCA Crim 1105, the Court reaffirmed that repeated, deliberate theft from vulnerable retail operations warrants sentences that reflect the broader harms beyond mere property loss. In that case, the offender was found to have stolen essential medical supplies on multiple occasions, actions held to elevate culpability due to associated risks to public health.

Similarly, the Court of Appeal in R v. Malone [2024] EWCA Crim 409, addressing offences involving the theft of infant formula and hygiene products, underscored the enhanced seriousness attached to crimes that impact particularly sensitive categories of goods. Though your offending lacks that precise dimension, the principle of contextual harm remains apposite.

It is accepted that immediate custody is not invariably appropriate in such cases; nonetheless, the threshold for community sentences has shifted in the context of ongoing societal pressures, as set out in R v. Baxter [2022] EWCA Crim 955, a case involving sustained acquisitive offending targeting independent grocers, where a custodial sentence was deemed necessary to provide sufficient deterrence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Other cases of note, albeit less factually proximate, illustrate the judiciary’s cautious approach in balancing rehabilitative opportunities against the imperatives of public protection and culpability assessment:

- R v. Yates [2020] EWCA Crim 815 involved a defendant convicted of unlawful possession of a bladed article in a school car park, resulting in an immediate custodial sentence due to the proximity to vulnerable minors. Though unrelated to theft, it affirms the courts’ attentiveness to contextual risk factors.

- R v. Fenwick [2021] EWCA Crim 1302 concerned offences of fly-tipping on green belt land, highlighting the environmental cost of apparently “minor” regulatory breaches.

- R v. Thornton [2019] EWCA Crim 425, involving an affray after a pub altercation with pool cues, underscores the escalation potential in repeated offences.

While these cases differ materially in subject and gravity, their inclusion here serves to indicate the broader sentencing landscape within which acquisitive crimes are contextualised.

Victim Impact and Community Considerations  
The personal impact upon retail workers, staff management, and proprietors in this case has been thoroughly documented. Victim impact statements submitted from three affected premises depict not only financial losses but also the weariness and anxiety occasioned by repeated thefts, adjustments to shift patterns, and increased security measures.

The local charity ShopSafe Nottinghamshire has provided observations on the toll such offences exact on front-line staff who often act as the first and only point of contact for vulnerable offenders. Their briefing paper highlights the delicate balance between enforcement and compassion, emphasising that victim recovery extends beyond immediate loss to encompass workplace wellbeing.

It is of note that the defendant’s letter, tendered with the assistance of Ms Leah Grant of the Nottingham Community Legal Centre, exhibits a clear, though belated, remorseful tone; composed in legible and unadorned handwriting, the letter acknowledges wrongdoing and requests consideration of personal circumstances.

The defendant’s circumstances include ongoing housing instability reported to the court, an issue mirrored by wider societal challenges in Nottingham and beyond. The court is acutely aware of the significant strain placed on emergency and supported housing services, exacerbated by recent economic difficulties and policy shifts impacting social welfare entitlement eligibility.

The interrelationship between deprivation, mental health, and offending behaviour is complex and often frustratingly opaque. This court refuses simplistic attributions and remains committed to a nuanced, evidence-based approach, mindful of both individual accountability and systemic context.

Additional Expert Assessments  
I refer to the psychiatric report prepared by Dr Jonathan Willis, consultant forensic psychiatrist, following a detailed clinical interview and review of collateral information. While diagnosing no major mental illness, Dr Willis notes traits consistent with borderline personality disorder features, alongside a history of depressive episodes and intermittent substance misuse.

Of particular relevance is the expert’s commentary on the defendant’s impulsivity and difficulties with emotional regulation, coupled with a pattern of disengagement from offered therapeutic support. Dr Willis opines cautiously on the prospects for rehabilitation, highlighting the critical importance of structured interventions and continuity of care.

Reference must be made to the prevailing challenges within the NHS framework for accessing specialist psychological therapies, a systemic feature not of your making but nevertheless impacting on outcomes.

The probation pre-sentence report reinforces this picture. It identifies medium risk of harm, with no evidence of coercion or gang affiliation, and medium risk of reoffending, linked principally to entrenched acquisitive behaviours and unresolved social needs. It notes some cooperation with supervising officers, but inconsistent engagement with programmes designed to address offending cognitions or financial management.

You have recorded four prior convictions for theft-related offences, dated between 2017 and 2023. Although none resulted in immediate custodial sentences, community resolutions and suspended sentences were applied, yet recurrence was evident. This pattern is of concern, reflecting a failure to desist despite opportunities.

While there is no evidence you have employed threats or violence in the course of offending, accounts from victims indicate a tangible atmosphere of intimidation engendered by your repeated presence and conduct.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

It is important to observe that the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has reported a recent resurgence in synthetic opioid use in Nottinghamshire, complicating the social milieu in which offending occurs. Though not directly implicated here, the increased strain on health and justice services is a pertinent backdrop.

The court also acknowledges the diligent efforts of Ms Anna Taylor of the Nottingham Retail Support Network, whose case management notes express cautious hope that enhanced community-based support might assist in reducing reoffending, pending sentence.

Considerations and Sentencing Framework  
Sentencing must be proportionate, reflecting seriousness, culpability, and harm, balanced against mitigating factors where applicable. The offences in question represent a persistent, systematic course of conduct, demonstrating clear intent, planning, and disregard for prior warnings.

The sentencing guideline issued by the Sentencing Council in 2021 remains the cornerstone, addressing theft offences with factors including frequency, value, harm, vulnerability of victims, and offender antecedents playing significant roles.

Your guilty plea, entered on 14 September 2025, offers limited mitigation given its timing—coming well after the compilation of substantial evidence and the imposition of pre-trial preparation measures. As established in R v. McKinley [2020] EWCA Crim 418, the timing of a plea is as relevant as its entry in determining discount.

I am conscious of your personal difficulties, particularly relating to housing and mental health vulnerability. The court recognises the importance of bespoke rehabilitative measures and will consider such factors carefully in final sentencing.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

I also make note that this case proceeded under particular listing pressures due to ongoing staff shortages exacerbated by recent strike actions within the judiciary and support services. These delays, while regrettable, are an unsatisfactory but increasingly frequent feature within the temporal landscape of Crown Court work.

Conclusion and Next Steps  
I will accordingly adjourn sentencing to enable the probation service to prepare a detailed report, incorporating considerations of risk, suitable interventions—including potential cognitive-behavioural and accredited thinking skills programmes—and accommodation needs. The report should also include any updated information from mental health services.

In the meantime, I reiterate the court’s expectation that you engage positively with all available support to maximise prospects for rehabilitation and reduce the risk of further offending.

This court extends its thanks to Ms Grace Mayfield, solicitor advocate, who has represented you throughout with professional diligence, and to Mr Thomas Wright, prosecuting, whose submissions were thorough and measured.

These sentencing remarks are issued on 18 October 2025, in Court 5 at Nottingham Crown Court. The proceedings have been recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules.
