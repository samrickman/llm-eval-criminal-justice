IN THE CROWN COURT AT PETERBOROUGH  
R v. MR H  
Case No. P2025/04538  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge L. J. WINTERTON  
Filed: 14 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court for sentence following your conviction for theft from retail premises, offences contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. These offences are alleged to have occurred over a protracted period extending from late 2023 into early 2025, involving various stores within the Peterborough and surrounding Cambridgeshire district. The pattern of offending is characterised by repeated acts of shoplifting, involving items of mixed value but chronic in their persistence and impact.

Procedural History  
You were apprehended on 7 March 2025, following an investigation jointly conducted by Peterborough Neighbourhood Policing Team and the East of England Regional Business Crime Operational Unit. The investigation commenced after multiple reports to the Business Crime Reduction Partnership from independent retailers and supermarket chains noting suspicious behaviour and increasing shrinkage losses. Initial enquiries were hampered by inconsistent reportage, limited cross-jurisdictional liaison, and staffing shortages impinging on the police’s sustained attention to what is often categorised as “low level” acquisitive crime. The court notes, with a degree of professional unease, that such resource constraints are a regrettably familiar feature regionally and nationally.

The process of liaising between retailers, police, local authority enforcement officers, and third-sector crime prevention agencies is procedurally fraught and administratively complex. It typically involves myriad interlocking protocols, ranging from data-sharing agreements under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which in its application to criminal investigations often carries subtle interpretive challenges. Such multilayered governance frameworks inevitably slow investigative progress, sometimes at critical junctures. Nonetheless, the partnership in this instance functioned adequately within such constraints to coordinate evidence collation and suspect identification.

The issue of efficient case progression in lower tier Crown Court matters has been a matter of periodic judicial commentary. The Better Case Management (BCM) system, inaugurated in 2015, sets out indicative timelines for each stage of prosecution, from charge to plea and trial preparation. The aim, laudable in principle, is to reduce delay and minimise wastage of public resources. Unfortunately, cases such as this demonstrate how mechanical targets often founder on real-world complexities, including Legal Aid funding authorisations, expert report availability, and witness scheduling. It must be said at the outset that this case suffered modest but consequential delays, largely attributable to the latter two factors.

Initial listing for plea was scheduled for 8 April 2025, but was adjourned following the defence's application for a psychiatric assessment—an exercise complicated by limited availability of court-appointed experts in this jurisdiction. Funding for such assessment was authorised belatedly on 26 April, following protracted correspondence with the Legal Aid Agency marked by shifting procedural requirements and requests for additional documentation. Such delays, while inconvenient, are not unique. They reflect systemic pressures on the agency, which continue to fuel professional anxiety about access to timely justice.

Mr H was represented throughout by Mr Simon Ellery, instructed under a Legal Aid representation order. The prosecution was conducted by Ms Olivia Farnsworth, Crown Advocate from the Cambridgeshire Crown Prosecution Service. Both counsel are to be commended for their measured and professional handling of case management applications and advocacy on this occasion.

Following receipt of the psychiatric assessment and relevant witness statements, you entered a plea of guilty on 29 May 2025, at the plea and trial preparation hearing. This was at a point somewhat later than the earliest available opportunity and accordingly, the court must take a restrained view of any associated credit for early acceptance of responsibility.

It is necessary, however, to contextualise this not merely within the formal procedural timeframe but also within the broader litigational landscape. Delays in the administration of justice occasion not only inconvenience but may also affect the defendant’s credit for plea, rendering what might otherwise be considered early admission into a more equivocal domain. Such nuance is not lost upon this court.

General Context and Observations on acquisitive offending    
The court is mindful of the wider social, economic, and institutional backdrop against which this case has unfolded. The persistence of petty acquisitive offences presents a distinct challenge to criminal justice agencies and communities alike. In recent years, the criminal justice system has grappled with escalating prevalence of shoplifting crimes, often coinciding with pronounced austerity measures, housing instability, and reductions in social support provision.

Community partners have repeatedly voiced concern over the normalisation of low-level offending within certain demographic cohorts, a feature compounded by the conflation of criminal conduct with entrenched socioeconomic deprivation. The court neither trivialises these factors nor regards them as excuses, but recognises their relevance in the shaping of offender profiles and sentencing considerations.

A sobering observation relates to the extraordinary operational effort expended by enforcing authorities in such matters, which while appearing minor in isolation, cumulatively rank amongst the most resource-intensive activities for local police teams. The deployment of multi-agency intelligence units, for example, entails costs not merely financial but in terms of diverted attention from complex investigations into serious or organised crime.

Reference can be made to the region’s Business Crime Reduction Partnership’s 2024 annual report, which notes a 7% increase in retail theft offences over the preceding year, accompanied by substantial strain on agency collaboration. The court further acknowledges the continuing contributions of voluntary-sector organisations, such as the Peterborough Retail Support Network, who provide victim liaising and support functions, even as they report funding uncertainty that threatens operational continuity.

It is within this milieu that Mr H’s conduct must be examined. While the offences may appear trivial individually, the court is left with the unequivocal understanding of their cumulative toll on businesses, employees, and community trust.

Legal Framework  
Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 makes it an offence to dishonestly appropriate property belonging to another with the intention to permanently deprive. The sentencing framework applicable to offences of this nature has evolved considerably over recent decades—incorporating the principles of proportionality, deterrence, rehabilitation, and public protection.

The Sentencing Council’s guideline for theft offences, most recently issued in 2019, provides a detailed tariff structure based on value, culpability, and the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors. Relevant factors decline or increase seriousness depending upon the defendant’s previous record, use of offence-specific modus operandi, the vulnerability of victims, and context of offending.

The Court of Appeal has provided important clarifications through binding precedents. For instance, in R v. Harper [2023] EWCA Crim 929, the court addressed persistent petty theft involving repeat visits to multiple premises, underscoring that the cumulative impact informs culpability and proportionality in sentencing, not merely the discrete value of individual thefts.

Similarly, in R v. Dalrymple [2022] EWCA Crim 411, the principles relating to timing and weight of guilty pleas were revisited. The judgment reaffirmed that credit for plea is not automatic but contingent upon genuine and timely acceptance of responsibility, with reductions tapered accordingly as the plea is deferred.

The present case falls squarely within these frameworks.

It is notable that the offences encompassed a diverse range of goods, including high-demand toiletries, over-the-counter medicines, confectionery items, and personal care products. The court was presented with detailed CCTV analyses, staff accounts, and police reports corroborating the pattern of repeated offending.

Typically, the defendant employed tactics such as use of large bags for concealment, timing entries during shift changes, and in some instances the switching of garments to obfuscate identification. On one occasion, he was observed manipulating anti-theft devices with apparent familiarity.

Other pieces of evidence include the recovery of several items hidden in temporary accommodation and the discovery of multiple security tag removers in possession at the time of arrest.

The behavioural pattern signals deliberate and considered conduct rather than impulsive lapse.

The impact upon victims—who include both independent shop owners and larger retail franchises—has been documented comprehensively. Testimonial statements from store managers describe an atmosphere of heightened anxiety, stress, and apprehension amongst front-line staff, some of whom requested altered or reduced hours to avoid exposure during peak offending times.

One local pharmacy operator detailed the cost implications of losses estimated at nearly £1,500 across a three-month period, taking into account shrinkage, re-stocking, and additional security measures adopted post-offending.

Importantly, the psychological impact on employees is not to be underestimated. Both the Retail Support Network and the Peterborough Chamber of Commerce observe that persistent shoplifting contributes to a broader climate of workplace stress and diminished sense of safety.

Unsurprisingly, the cumulative economic toll extends beyond raw stock losses, encompassing insurance premiums, staff turnover, and reputational damage to premises regarded as targets.

Alongside such qualitative evidence, the prosecution placed reliance upon contemporaneously obtained forensic findings. Wear traces on stolen goods, matched clothing fibres, and mobile phone location data constituted a substantial body of proof.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

The relationship between police witnesses and prosecution counsel was courteous and professional throughout trial preparation, and the Crown is to be commended on the thoroughness of evidential presentation against the background of high caseload pressures.

It is appropriate also to observe that the defence provided timely disclosure and complied with directions under the Criminal Procedure Rules, notwithstanding the challenges posed by incomplete financial records and the late submission of some mitigating documentation.

The defendant is a 34-year-old male, currently residing in temporary accommodation provided by Cambridgeshire County Council’s housing department. He reports sporadic engagement with social services, intermittent employment history often curtailed by health and personal issues, and limited familial support.

The psychiatric assessment prepared by Dr Nisha Agrawal, consultant forensic psychiatrist, offers a nuanced clinical perspective. While no evidence of major mental disorder was found, the report indicates traits of impulsivity, low mood, and episodes consistent with adjustment disorder, possibly exacerbated by substance misuse.

Dr Agrawal recommended a community-based rehabilitative approach but highlighted the defendant's limited engagement with prior support offerings.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

The probation service has also provided a pre-sentencing referral report, referencing Mr H’s history of sporadic compliance with court orders, previous community resolutions for similar offences dating back to 2019, and a caution issued in 2021.

Sentencing Remarks  
The court recognises the complexity attendant upon sentencing a defendant with a persistent, calculated pattern of offending such as this. While the offences themselves do not embody substantial financial loss individually, the aggregate effect is non-trivial.

Mr H has a criminal record of acquisitive offending, which is by no means extensive but indicates a concerning repetition that community interventions to date have failed to curtail.

The Crown recommends a custodial sentence, emphasizing the need for deterrence and protection of the public detailed in the Sentencing Council’s guidelines.

Conversely, the defence submits for a community-based disposal, citing the defendant’s housing instability, his engagement with support services in recent months, and the absence of violence or threats in the offending.

The court weighs these submissions with circumspection.

Acknowledgement is due to charities and support groups locally that work tirelessly to mitigate the factors underpinning offending—including housing insecurity, benefit delays, and mental health challenges. However, these realities do not negate individual accountability.

The court recalls the observations of the Court of Appeal in R v. Jefferson [2021] EWCA Crim 2178, where a community sentence was considered appropriate for an offender with multiple past convictions of shoplifting, provided there was demonstrable intention to comply with rehabilitative conditions.

It remains imperative that sentencing decisions are rooted in an assessment of risk, culpability, and the aim of reducing reoffending.

The court also wishes to place on record its appreciation of the staff of the local Business Crime Reduction Partnership, whose nuanced understanding of the impacts of retail crime informs judicial decision-making in this jurisdiction.

The matter will proceed to sentence at the hearing scheduled for 10 October 2025. At that time, the court will consider any further reports, representations, and updated risk assessments.

Today’s proceedings have taken place in an adequately ventilated courtroom, recently refurbished to improve accessibility for individuals with sensory impairments. The court registrar and ushers are acknowledged for their efficiency and courtesy in maintaining the dignity of these proceedings.

I am grateful to Ms Olivia Farnsworth for her diligent prosecution and to Mr Simon Ellery for his advocacy on behalf of Mr H.

The defendant is reminded of his right to appeal any sentence imposed within 28 days, in accordance with the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.
