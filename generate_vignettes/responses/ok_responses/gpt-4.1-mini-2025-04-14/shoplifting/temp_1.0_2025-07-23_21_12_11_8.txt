IN THE CROWN COURT AT STRATFORD  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/13427  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge M. F. CRAWFORD  
Filed: 19 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear for sentencing today, having been convicted of theft from retail premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The offences forming the basis of this prosecution span an extended period from early 2023 through to April 2025, and were committed at various shops within the boroughs of Stratford, East Ham, and neighbouring districts. While each instance might, on its own, appear minor in financial terms, the aggregate pattern and the repeated nature of your conduct require careful judicial consideration.

Procedural History and Case Management  
Your arrest took place on 27 April 2025, following a collaboration between local policing units and the newly established East London Retail Crime Partnership. The investigation, which also involved liaison with CCTV analysts and local business security officers, was initiated due to a sustained increase in shoplifting reports from multiple community stores. This partnership, inaugurated only in mid-2023, aims to coordinate information-sharing among affected businesses, improve incident reporting, and facilitate offender management. It is worth noting that the East London Retail Crime Partnership, despite admirable ambition, has contended with frequent staff turnover and fluctuating funding streams, which has posed challenges in maintaining consistent service delivery.

The proceedings in this matter have been subject to several adjournments and were listed initially before Magistrates’ Court East Ham, before committal to this Crown Court. The transfer represented an application by the prosecution under section 51A of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, reflecting concern over the scale and repetition of offending. Despite logistical constraints induced by regional court refurbishments and intermittent strike action by court staff, the trial and subsequent sentencing hearings have proceeded without undue delay beyond the unavoidable interruptions. During the earlier stages, the defence applied for disclosure of digital forensic material relating to mobile device evidence seized during your arrest. This process entailed significant technical review by forensic experts, with analysis extending to communications metadata and location history, under powers authorised by a warrant issued by District Judge Elmore on 3 March 2025.

At the Plea and Trial Preparation Hearing on 16 July 2025, you entered a plea of not guilty, prompting preparatory disclosures by the Crown. The tender of further surveillance evidence and witness statements subsequently precipitated a change of plea. On 17 September 2025, symbolic of a wider trend observed in similar cases, you finally pled guilty to the consolidated representative charge shortly before trial commencement. The court is mindful that late pleas, while permissible, tend to attract reduced mitigation in credit assessments pursuant to the principles set out in R v. Mulholland [2022] EWCA Crim 1954. It is well established that such credit is reserved for genuine expressions of remorse that also yield procedural economies, and not simply for tactical capitulation when conviction is inevitable.

The Better Case Management (BCM) framework, in which this case has been managed, continues to serve as a critical mechanism to ensure expediency and clarity in case progression. However, even within BCM parameters, the court has noted the recurrence of administrative difficulties, such as delayed Legal Aid approval for expert reports and intermittent availability of interpreters, which have cumulatively affected case flow. These factors, while peripheral to your personal conduct, do underscore systemic pressures faced by courts today.

A number of reports have been submitted for consideration. The Probation Service provided a standard Risk of Serious Harm Assessment on 25 August 2025, marking the risk as low to medium and highlighting your history of previous acquisitive offences. A psychiatric report authored by Dr Eleanor Briggs, consultant forensic psychiatrist, dated 10 September 2025, offers a detailed analysis of your mental state, concluding that there are no major psychiatric disorders present but identifying features consistent with mild anxiety and impulsivity that may contribute to your offending behaviour.

In her report, Dr Briggs carefully emphasises the distinction between diagnosable illness and personality traits associated with disinhibition, warning against conflating the two in mitigation. She raises concerns regarding your limited engagement with community support services and notes that significant unmet social needs, including housing instability, may be contributory but not determinative factors. Dr Briggs also advises that the prospects of rehabilitative intervention would be enhanced by your active participation in cognitive-behavioural programmes addressing thinking errors and impulse control.

The court has also received written representations from the Stratford Retailers’ Association, which include victim impact statements from store managers describing a climate of heightened anxiety and staff turnover rates linked to your pattern of offending. One representative letter dated 2 September 2025 from the manager of a community pharmacy notes that since the inception of your offending conduct, there has been a measurable increase in stock control issues, with some shelves remaining locked during shifts due to fear of pilferage.

Though they do not wish to see the imposition of unnecessarily severe punishment, the victims implore the court to reflect the cumulative harm caused, pointing to not just financial loss but the demoralisation and stress endured by employees required to work under heightened vigilance.

Additional correspondence includes a letter from the local charity, Helping Hands Homeless Outreach, dated 14 August 2025, which attests to the challenges faced in supporting individuals experiencing housing precarity in East London. The author, Ms Leah Choudhury, highlights the chronic shortage of emergency accommodation and concedes that even with referrals to these services, engagement is variable. This situation is emblematic of a broader social strain on voluntary organisations grappling with funding cuts amidst rising demand.

It is impossible to ignore the wider socio-economic backdrop against which offences such as yours take place. Year upon year, statistics from the Metropolitan Police Service reveal a persistent rise in acquisitive crimes in urban areas grappling with concentrated deprivation, high unemployment, and fractured community cohesion. The implications for policing are significant, taxing resources that might otherwise be directed towards more serious offences. The Business Crime Reduction Partnerships, of which the East London partnership is one example, have become linchpins in efforts to mitigate retail theft and coordinate offender management. Still, their effectiveness hinges both on adequate resourcing and inter-agency collaboration, both of which are in flux.

The court acknowledges, with some regret, the difficulty in balancing the legitimate need for public protection with the imperatives of rehabilitation, particularly where systemic social failures complicate individual agency. In past cases such as R v. Denton [2019] EWCA Crim 1756, the Court of Appeal underscored that sentences for repeat acquisitive offenders must strike a measured balance — ensuring deterrence while keeping open the prospect of reintegration. Denton involved a defendant whose shoplifting escalated to include more serious property offences, culminating in sentences reflecting both culpability and rehabilitative need.

In your case, no evidence has suggested escalation beyond theft. Nonetheless, the persistent pattern of offending cannot be downplayed. The court also notes the guidance of the Sentencing Council’s Theft Offences guideline, particularly para 4.4 which states that repeat offending, use of deception, and impact on vulnerable victims are aggravating factors.

The court is grateful to the defence counsel, Mr James Linton, KC, for his careful submissions on your behalf, which have sought to emphasise your personal circumstances, including reported struggles with unstable housing arrangements serviced by multiple temporary placements and periods of reliance on informal accommodation networks. Mr Linton also highlighted your somewhat strained familial relationships and sporadic employment history.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}.

While it is neither routine nor desirable to conflate social hardship with criminal responsibility, such contextual factors are properly taken into account in tailoring an appropriate sentence consistent with the principles set out in R v. Pearson [2020] EWCA Crim 1296, where mitigating factors included personal history and prospects for reform through structured support. That case distinguished itself in applying a community order with strict rehabilitation requirements alongside curfew provisions.

The present case also brings to mind the interpretation in R v. Forde [2021] EWCA Crim 2043 concerning community-based sentences for persistent acquisitive crime, where the Court emphasised that the existence of prior interventions weighed heavily in sentencing decisions. In Forde, the offender’s failure to engage with community programmes after multiple warnings led to an eventual custodial sentence.

It is known to this court that the availability of appropriate support for individuals with acquisitive offending patterns is uneven across boroughs. The Probation Service in East London has reported personnel shortages and high case loads, which limit the frequency and depth of offender engagement. This systemic context cannot entirely excuse individual failings, but it informs the court’s practical approach to sentencing.

Furthermore, the Legal Aid Agency’s current application processes continue to impact the timely instruction of expert witnesses. In this instance, applications for funding to instruct Dr Briggs were delayed by procedural clarifications spanning several months, adding complexity to the preparation of your defence.

The NHS London Mental Health Trust’s community outreach teams operate under considerable strain, compounded by increasing referrals and lengthy waiting lists for psychological therapies. Despite these challenges, the Trust’s staff have demonstrated exceptional commitment, often conducting home visits to maintain contact with individuals at risk of disengagement.

Given these operational realities, courts are encouraged to support community sentences involving non-custodial supervision aligned with access to mental health and financial counselling services. In the absence of such engagement, the risk of reoffending rises.

The court is reminded of the enduring importance of public confidence in the justice system’s capacity to address not only serious violent or sexual offences, but also the more pervasive strains caused by low-level thefts that, cumulatively, erode social trust and neighbourhood security.

It is worth observing, though somewhat tangentially, that this court’s registry recently hosted a seminar on the challenges of prosecuting environmental offences, such as illegal fly-tipping and waste disposal, which, while distinct from property crime, similarly reflect patterns of social neglect and regulatory disregard. Cases like R v. Farnsworth [2023] EWCA Crim 1887 serve as cautionary tales about the cumulative harms of such conduct on community wellbeing.

Similarly, unrelated prosecutions for affray involving pub brawls, referred to in R v. Dalloway [2018] EWCA Crim 1301, bear scant resemblance to the charges here, but help illuminate the spectrum of offences confronting modern courts. The co-defendant in that case faced longer sentences due to use of a weapon; a stark contrast to your non-violent course of offending.

I must also take this opportunity to mention, albeit peripherally, the commendable work of the East London Community Trust, which has continued to provide rehabilitation and outreach services despite fiscal constraints and staffing downtimes attributable to pandemic-related absences.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}.

In terms of victim impact, it is heartening to note that no physical injuries or threats of violence were involved. Nevertheless, the psychological and fiscal consequences upon staff and business proprietors are material and must be reflected in the overall assessment of harm.

Likewise, while your familial circumstances include notable tensions and limited formal support networks, no evidence was adduced to suggest coercive or controlling influences that might have compromised your autonomy.

The court also notes previous warnings issued by multi-agency forums such as the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), although MAPPA itself principally addresses cases with higher public protection risk factors than those present here.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}.

To summarise, this is a case of repeat, deliberate shoplifting with a moderate but cumulatively significant impact on victims, public confidence, and policing resources. Your conduct has reflected a concerning pattern of disregard for social norms, despite repeated opportunities for intervention and support.

Prior convictions and contact with the criminal justice system indicate a history of similar behaviour. The late plea entered affords some but not full mitigation. The psychiatric and probation reports recommend community-based interventions incorporating cognitive skills training and ongoing case management to reduce the possibility of reoffending.

Sentencing will be adjourned pending receipt of a full pre-sentence report exploring the feasibility of such interventions, the availability of suitable placements, and the extent of your engagement potential. This report should also assess risk of harm and compliance prospects.

I remind you, Mr H, that the sentence is intended not solely as a punitive measure but as an opportunity for rehabilitation where possible, balanced with the need to uphold public protection and deter similar offending.

These sentencing remarks are made this day, 19 September 2025, in Court 5 at the Crown Court at Stratford. The proceedings have been recorded and transcribed pursuant to Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is reminded of the right of appeal against sentence within 28 days under the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. No reporting restrictions apply. Costs are reserved.

These are the orders of the court.
