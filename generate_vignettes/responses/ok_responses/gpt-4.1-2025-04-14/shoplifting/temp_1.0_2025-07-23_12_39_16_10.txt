IN THE CROWN COURT AT STRATFORD  
R v. MR H  
Case No. P2025/03812  
Sentencing Remarks – His Honour Judge F. G. LYNCH  
Filed: 4 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence following your conviction for an offence of theft from shop premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The single count on the indictment before the court encapsulates a repeated and methodical course of conduct involving incidents across a number of retail settings in East London, as unfolded between the months of November 2024 and March 2025.

I begin by noting that the chronology of proceedings in this case has been elongated by a succession of adjournments for the adducing of additional psychiatric, probation, and safeguarding assessments; the late service of CCTV compilation evidence by the Crown; and the understandable necessity granted to your defence to secure instructions and obtain specialist opinion evidence. Sentencing was initially listed for 14 July 2025 but, following a defence application supported by the Legal Aid Agency, adjourned first to 11 August and then ultimately to today’s date. I record my thanks to all counsel for their persistence in progressing the matter despite persistent administrative obstacles and intermittent delays in the processing of representation orders.

The history of delay in such matters is, regrettably, far from unusual. The Legal Aid Agency’s increasingly risk-averse approach to cost authorisations—especially regarding expert psychiatric review—has come to stand as a predictable impediment in each serious acquisition crime heard by this court. I note, with concern, that two written applications for authority to instruct Dr Nash (psychiatrist) and Ms Dias (clinical psychologist) were met with requests for “further particularisation” on three separate occasions. That these applications took four weeks to resolve—despite clear indications of mental health history—demonstrates a continuing bureaucratic myopia at the centre of state-funded legal practice. Such systemic inertia distorts the procedural calendar, increases the stress on defendants and witnesses, and erodes public confidence in the efficiency of the justice system as a whole. It is only right to highlight these matters, not as a critique of individuals, but of longstanding dysfunction.

You have at all material times cooperated with bail conditions, having first been arrested on 23 March 2025 outside a retail outlet on the Bow High Street, as the culmination of a multi-week pro-active operation coordinated by officers of the Metropolitan Police Service (“MPS”) Borough Command Unit 7, in partnership with the Stratford Business Crime Prevention Group (“SBCPG”). I am advised that you attended your interviews as required at Stratford police station and made no attempt to interfere with witnesses or commit further offences whilst on conditional bail. It would be remiss of this court not to acknowledge that minimum expectation.

However, the investigation which led to your arrest was resource intensive in ways not always apparent from the surface of such prosecutions. Retail theft of this sort is not, as is sometimes stated in the popular press, a trivial or “victimless” crime. In this case, responding officers prepared over 170 pages of disclosure, compiled material from 9 separate CCTV sources (some of which were non-time-indexed), and coordinated with no fewer than five distinct retail managers to produce a workable offender profile.

The procedural progress of the file was, in some small measure, expedited by the evolving integration between the MPS and the Borough’s Community Retail Partnership Desk; communications on 28 February and 3 March 2025 between Detective Sergeant Ahsan and loss prevention officers at the participating stores led directly to the identification of patterns of conduct, time of day, and preferred items of theft. That the Crown was able to prepare a coherent evidential narrative in this case is a testament to unglamorous, patient work by those routinely underappreciated. In that respect alone, the system functioned as envisaged by the Architects of the Better Case Management (“BCM”) protocol, although—as all in this courtroom will appreciate—such procedural smoothness remains regrettably exceptional. There have been points of difficulty—most notably, a disruption in the listing process on 26 June following a one-day strike by court administrative staff, which caused all trial and sentencing listings to be postponed en bloc. This, too, is indicative of the chronic institutional fragility that has embedded itself in our criminal justice system.

In the weeks preceding your arrest, store staff and management were asked to complete victim impact statements for use at trial and sentencing. These statements, written in careful and restrained terms, describe a cumulative anxiety among employees after numerous incidents—employees who, while not physically threatened, nonetheless spoke of a rising apprehension at the prospect of seeing you return. Retail managers supplied evidence of increased staff turnover and requests for support from the local Business Improvement District (“BID”), including a request for specialist security audits and risk assessments that, in less constrained circumstances, might not have been deemed necessary. The financial losses, although modest when taken individually, become significant in the aggregate, especially for independent and small-chain retailers whose margins are already subject to immense pressure from online commerce, rising rents, and instability in supply chains.

Important for context, but of only the most tenuous relevance to the actions of this defendant, is the evolving pattern of retail crime in the immediate area of the offences. Ms Desai, an intelligence analyst employed by the IntraBorough Community Safety Partnership, provided a short professional memorandum (dated 8 May 2025), which observed a year-on-year increase of 19% in reported shop thefts across the eastern retail corridor of Newham and Tower Hamlets. This aggregate trend, mirrored in comparable urban centres—Walthamstow, Paddington, the northern fringe of Ilford—has, as recent research from the Local Government Institute outlined, been strongly correlated with broader economic disruption and reductions in local authority-funded security initiatives. However, these are societal factors, not excuses, and cannot inform the proper basis for sentence except in the most limited of ways.

At the first case management hearing, held before this court on 19 May, you entered a plea of not guilty by representation. There followed a period of negotiation over the admissibility of a portion of the CCTV evidence: specifically, whether chain of custody protocols were robust enough to support the Crown’s assertion that the footage recovered from the Poplar branch of Taylor Chemists Ltd was unbroken. In the result, after a voir dire conducted over the course of two hours on 12 June 2025, I ruled in favour of the Crown, having found no material infirmity likely to prejudice the integrity of the evidence, applying Smith [2009] EWCA Crim 3410, which affirms that the paramount test for admissibility remains the probability of accuracy rather than the episodic documentation habits of the collecting officer.

I turn now to the framework of the law. Section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 provides the elements of the offence, namely dishonesty, appropriation of property belonging to another, and the intention to permanently deprive. The Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline, revised in 2016, identifies three principal axes for the assessment of seriousness: the value of goods taken, the degree of planning, and the overall impact on the victim or community. While this index offence is charged on the basis of a single act, I must have regard, in accordance with principle and authority, to the totality of the course of conduct established by the Crown.

The case of R v Stackhouse [2023] EWCA Crim 1405—occasioning from a prolonged series of shop thefts against a chain of independent bakeries in North Lancashire—provides a salient reminder that “persistent and patterned theft from small businesses carries an aggravating quality beyond mere monetary quantification.” In that case, the defendant was found to have repeatedly targeted corner stores and bakeries, acting alone and relying on staff absences to facilitate his offending. Conviction followed the recovery of distinctive packaging and several items of clothing matched to CCTV. Stackhouse is relevant to the present assessment by reason of its reiteration that repeat, low-level thefts directed at vulnerable retail environments must be met with community protection in mind. I do, however, note a point of factual distinction: Stackhouse involved a campaign of threats to staff, a feature not present in the instant case.  

I am also reminded of R v Krulak [2022] EWCA Crim 1155—a decision arising from the Crown Court at Liverpool—where the defendant was convicted of affray arising from an altercation in the car park of a public house following a confrontation during a Champions League match. That matter, while illustrative of sentencing in violence-related offences, is of no substantive relevance to the issues before me. More generally, however, it serves as a prompt to reflect on the importance the courts attach to public order and community safety—principles which must also inform the response to persistent acquisitive offending, even where actual or threatened violence is absent.

I acknowledge as well the guidance provided in the matter of R v Atkins [2021] EWCA Crim 1689, involving the illegal disposal of asbestos—fly-tipping—on green belt land in the South West. There, the environmental degradation was said to have undermined the confidence of the local population and brought material harm to the ecosystem. Again, while the conduct in Atkins is not analogous in nature to the conduct before this court, it is helpful insofar as it underlines the need for deterrence in cases where repeated anti-social behaviour has a corrosive effect on public spaces.

Before setting out the particular facts of your offending, I am obliged to note that the Crown submitted a schedule of antecedent matters relating to the conduct of a co-defendant, Ms T, who failed to answer court bail and is, as of today’s date, subject to an outstanding bench warrant. It is important to clarify, for the record, that Ms T’s actions—in particular, the charges of criminal damage to a church noticeboard and unauthorised possession of a bladed article in a school car park—have not been alleged to involve or implicate you. The schedule of her offences has played no part in my consideration of sentence. Your conviction is judged on its unique factual basis and not by association. Similarly, a prior investigation into the affairs of your estranged brother, who was convicted last year of benefit fraud in a wholly unrelated matter, has no bearing whatsoever on these sentencing remarks.

Turning now to the facts of your case as they have been established through prosecution evidence, defence submissions, and the agreed record of admissions:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

It is apparent from the victim statements, CCTV, and subsequent admissions in your interview that a series of thefts employed a variety of methods—ranging from the calculated use of “distraction” during till openings to the more basic, opportunistic seizures of goods during shift handovers or at points of customer congestion at self-service checkout bays. You did not threaten violence, carry any weapon, or verbally abuse staff; the offence was completed in silence and with a degree of cool deliberation. Nonetheless, the impact on staff morale and customer security was substantial, albeit indirect.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

Of particular note is the repeated selection of high-value consumer goods—most frequently, over-the-counter medicines, small electronics, and branded toiletries—in quantities exceeding personal consumption or impulse. On at least two occasions, the prosecution asserts, you altered your method of egress: using the fire exit on one occasion to avoid detection and, on another, brazenly walking past security after diverting their attention with a false report of a spillage.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

The Crown’s case has proceeded in tandem with a community impact statement submitted by the Stratford Retail Network on 29 April, aptly summarising the effect of persistent theft on local business resilience and highlighting the extent to which frequent, minor criminal incursions lead to more restrictive trading hours and increased insurance premiums. While these statements are routinely provided, their content in this instance was unusually detailed; the anecdote furnished by the manager of DCS Newsagents—who reported that, last Christmas, their stock of greeting cards was “almost entirely removed” in three consecutive days by an unidentified group—is illustrative of the demoralisation felt across the sector. That series of incidents, while unrelated to the conduct before me, is emblematic of the environment in which your offences unfolded.

I am, further, obliged to recognise the professional insight provided by Dr Nash in her psychiatric report of 17 July 2025. Dr Nash describes your presentation as indicative of complex trauma, compounded by a persistent but currently unmedicated depressive disorder. You reported to her a history of transient accommodation, estrangement from family, and a pattern of social withdrawal punctuated by periods of impulsivity. It is the finding of Dr Nash that, although you do not meet the diagnostic threshold for psychosis or personality disorder, your cognitive profile is marked by poor executive functioning and a tendency toward risk-taking in the context of acute stress.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Let it be said, however, that the mere presence of subjective difficulties—be they psychological, financial, or social—cannot justify offending. Dr Nash identifies multiple missed opportunities for you to engage with community mental health teams and to benefit from social prescribing. Far from demonstrating an inability to refrain, your conduct suggests a pattern of calculated decision-making. This court is no stranger to the argument that “need” should mitigate guilt or inclination. While hardship can explain, it cannot exculpate.

The pre-sentence report prepared by Ms Finn of the Stratford Probation Service, dated 31 July, notes your prior engagements with probation as “irregular” and “inconsistent,” with multiple instances of missed appointments. Ms Finn records your stated intention to seek employment but notes a “failure to attend Jobcentre appointments or to maintain contact with Work Coach assignments.” I am not satisfied that your engagement with available support has been sufficient to demonstrate true motivation to rehabilitate.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

I am told you have lived in a series of short-term lets in the Stratford, Hackney Wick, and Plaistow areas. Reference is made to you having applied for housing support with the council in 2022, but with your placement withdrawn due to repeated breaches of tenancy/licence conditions—this is, according to the housing officer’s correspondence, a matter of non-compliance with the basic rules, not a consequence of discrimination or bureaucratic error. Housing instability is certainly a risk factor for anti-social and acquisitive offending. I do not underestimate its gravity, but many navigate those challenges without recourse to criminal conduct.

The court has also reviewed the character reference submitted by your former employer at Regal Cleaning Services, Mr K Dempsey, who wrote with evident disappointment but a measure of sympathy, recalling you as “punctual and polite” prior to the breakdown of your working relationship in 2023. In contrast, this account is not mirrored by any evidence of recent commitment to lawful earning or positive engagement with employment support schemes.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

Your letter to this court, submitted in your own handwriting and dated 20 July 2025, is noted for its legibility, careful composition, and apparent candour as to the pressures and motivations underpinning your recent behaviour. However, assertions made therein—blaming your estrangement from family and the “collapse of trust” with your social worker—are considered in the round with your prior opportunities to seek help, enter substance misuse recovery, and seek housing support. While empathy is due to those in hardship, the wider experience of this court is that adversity alone does not determine criminality.

At this stage, I note the relevance—albeit tangential—of the Court of Appeal’s observations in R v Jory [2024] EWCA Crim 520, which concerned a defendant convicted of possession of indecent images of children, wholly unrelated to the present facts save that it involved examiner scrutiny of digital evidence files. The appellate court there reaffirmed the requirement for “robust procedural safeguards and clear documentation chains” in the handling of all digital disclosures. While the facts and sentencing considerations are of no material relevance to your own case, counsel for the defence cited Jory in support of a general submission regarding the preservation and audit of digital evidence in criminal litigation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Among the numerous submissions made to the court prior to sentencing, I have reviewed the representations of the North London Citizens’ Debt and Housing Clinic, which has provided support in the form of budgeting advice and attempted, albeit without success, to engage you with their legal advice project regarding housing arrears. Letters from staff indicate sporadic attendance at appointments and a reluctance to follow up with signposted resources. You may be interested to know that the Clinic survives on a shoestring budget and has been subject to threats of closure on four occasions in as many years. Their continued efforts to assist you, despite such adversity, do credit to their professionalism if not, on this occasion, to your motivation for substantive change.

The impact on the retail teams affected by your actions is further detailed in victim statements. Ms Katrin Karlsen, deputy manager at Willow Chemist, reported “persistent worrying” among evening staff and a decision to suspend stock of certain high value over-the-counter items during peak periods. This, alongside a voluntary capping of customer numbers at the request of staff, resulted in a temporary loss of sales for a ten-day period—though the shop was not forced to close outright. These indirect consequences are not trivial, nor are they inevitable in every instance of retail theft; the fact they occurred is a function of repeated disruption and the fear it fosters in otherwise routine work environments.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

I have also taken into account the recent Community Impact Assessment presented by the Borough Retail Crime Steering Panel, which, while referring primarily to an arson incident at a supermarket car park in Leytonstone in late 2023 (committed by persons unknown), frames your offending as a further contributory factor in rising community anxiety regarding retail vulnerability. While the arson is, for clarity, unrelated to the matter for sentence, the panel’s report offers useful context as to the wider consequences of persistent retail crime in an under-resourced policing environment.

I am conscious of the need for proportionality in sentence, balancing deterrence, public protection, and the imperatives of rehabilitation. Your previous convictions consist of three matters of theft from shop premises—most recently, a 2022 community order imposed at Snaresbrook Magistrates’ Court for theft of toiletries—and a series of non-criminal penalty notices for fare evasion and anti-social behaviour between 2020 and 2023. There are no convictions for violence, burglary, or robbery. While some aggravation attends by reason of repetition, there is no evidence of escalation to threatening or serious violence. No known gang association or evidence of control by third parties—features that might bear on risk assessment and criminal capacity—have been asserted by the prosecution or the police in the instant matter.

Reflections on the evolution of sentencing practice are unavoidable. It is now a matter of ordinary discourse—reflected in letters to the court from local councillors, the Chamber of Commerce, and the East London Small Business Federation—that there is an increasing expectation for heavy custodial sentences in cases of serial shoplifting. Such calls are always noted, but the function of the court is not to satisfy public pressure nor to administer “signal justice” for the sake of appearance. As reemphasised in R v Cairns [2020] EWCA Crim 2102, the Court of Appeal soundly rejected the notion that courts should “escalate” penalties simply to “send a message,” instead directing that all sentences must remain individually just and proportionate, grounded in the facts.

Resources for offender management, I do not need to remind probation, are presently stretched to their thinnest in modern memory. The report from the Chief Inspector of Probation—published earlier this year—identified excessive workloads, delayed supervision appointments, and the “chronic attrition of skilled staff” as material constraints upon the effective delivery of community sentences. These are, sadly, features of the wider landscape within which your prospects of rehabilitation must be gauged. They do not lessen your personal responsibility or excuse continued recidivism, but they do complicate the assessment of whether robust community alternatives to imprisonment remain genuinely available.

To summarise: I must sentence you for a repeated course of shoplifting, marked by selectivity of target, opportunistic (yet sometimes calculated) method, and an absence of violence or overt threat. The persistent evasion of available support services; the modest but real impact upon affected staff and businesses; and your continuing precariousness of housing and employment all inform the overall risk and need assessment.

In light of the seriousness of the offending, its persistent nature, and the limited evidence of recent engagement with rehabilitative services, I direct that a full pre-sentence report be prepared by Stratford Probation Service. This report shall specifically address the suitability of a Rehabilitation Activity Requirement (RAR), the prospect for inclusion in a Cognitive Skills Programme, and an assessment of whether an Unpaid Work Requirement or a Suspended Sentence Order might advance the aims of public protection and rehabilitation, having regard to your mental health background and housing status. I will not close off the prospect of a custodial sentence, but all realistic options are to be canvassed. The probation report shall further review the prospect of voluntary sector partnership support and any relevant recent changes to your personal circumstances not previously drawn to the court’s attention.

The matter is adjourned for sentencing to 25 September 2025. In the interim, you will remain on bail subject to the same conditions. You are advised of your right to appeal and to consult counsel upon receipt of any custodial sentence. Costs are reserved. No reporting restrictions are imposed.  

These are the orders of the court.
