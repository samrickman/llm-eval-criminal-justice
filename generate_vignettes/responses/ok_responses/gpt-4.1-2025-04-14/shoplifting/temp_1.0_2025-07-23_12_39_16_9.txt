IN THE CROWN COURT AT WORTLEY  
R v. MR H  
Case No: R2025/16390  
Sentencing Remarks of Her Honour Judge S. L. Barrows  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you appear for sentencing in this court following your conviction, by guilty plea, in respect of a single count of theft from a shop, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The events that give rise to these proceedings occurred over a short, yet significant, time period across the retail precincts of North Wortley and adjacent districts. The learned counsel for the prosecution is Ms Dolores Finch QC, and your defence is ably conducted by Mr Ewan Halim of Temple Chambers, instructed on a representation order. You have attended court today in person, and I am satisfied you have been fully advised as to both procedure and the ruling which now follows.

This matter first came before the lower court on 13 April 2025, following your arrest by officers from Central Wortley Police on the evening of 11 April. After initial charge and appearance, the matter was sent to the Crown Court for sentence, taking into account not only the gravity of the present offence but also the record of persistent offending alleged. The case was listed under the Early Guilty Plea (EGP) scheme in order to encourage timely resolution, but there were delays owing to, firstly, a late request for psychiatric evaluation, and secondly, an administrative confusion regarding case allocation to this bench rather than the original allocation in the Southern Division. I pause to observe—somewhat wearily—that such procedural inconveniences are, regrettably, now endemic even in matters where the facts themselves remain straightforward.

At the preliminary hearing convened in open court on 22 May 2025, you indicated, through counsel, your intent to plead guilty. A short adjournment was granted to allow for the timely infusion of a pre-sentence probation report, as well as a psychiatric screening via the NHS Forensic Assessment Unit. It would be remiss of me not to record my gratitude to Dr Isobel Killarney and Ms Fatmata Hassan, who produced their respective reports within critically constrained timeframes imposed by the summer listing pressure.

The court takes the opportunity to remark on the ongoing resource shortfall experienced by both probation and psychiatric liaison within the borough. It continues to be the case that—despite the undoubted commitment of staff—we operate under persistent disadvantage through chronic underfunding, unpredictable commissioning cycles, and the not-infrequent withdrawals of specialist practitioners at critical junctures due to unrelated staff sickness. That your case was able to proceed with only minor delay should not be mistaken for the norm.

I wish to acknowledge, also, the diligence shown by prosecution and defence alike in facilitating the assembly of disclosure and relevant material. Ms Finch’s skeleton argument was both concise and apposite, and your counsel’s mitigation submissions have not sought to overstate the limited prospects of rehabilitation by reference to speculative supports not yet engaged.  

Turning now to the core facts of the present matter, I am directed to the applicable authorities and the Sentencing Council’s published guideline for offences of theft from a shop or stall, effective from 1 February 2016. Paragraph 4.2 of the guideline, if I may remind all present, stresses the relevance of both the mode and persistence of offending over the nominal value of the goods in question, particularly in cases of repeat targeting of vulnerable stores. I am satisfied on the evidence that this is such a case.

Before addressing the particulars, I note for the record the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in R v. Ainsworth [2023] EWCA Crim 412, in which an immediate custodial sentence of 15 months was upheld for repeated targeting of a local hardware shop, the defendant having breached multiple exclusion orders and personally threatened a member of staff with abusive language. The court there observed that “the persistent violation of retail premises erodes commercial and community confidence in equal measure, and can justify a robust response where rehabilitative prospects remain poor.” It bears stressing, however, that the facts of Ainsworth included not only repeat theft but also intimidation. The present matter, so far as the agreed basis of plea suggests, involves no threats or violence.

It is further relevant to consider the wider societal trends in similar offending. It is a feature of recent years that retail offences have increased both in frequency and in boldness, often involving individuals acting alone and targeting stores where CCTV or in-person security is minimal. Notwithstanding improved liaison between local authorities and the Wortley Retail Partnership, it is apparent from the data available to the court that shoplifting in this jurisdiction is not only a recurring problem, but one that places disproportionate strain on small traders—many of whom report that shrinkage of even a few hundred pounds can jeopardise the viability of their entire operation. The notion, sometimes expressed by the ill-informed, that so-called ‘petty’ theft is victimless, is demonstrably false. The economic and psychological costs accumulate, both for retailers and the staff who must implement restrictive, sometimes intrusive, measures to compensate.

Procedurally, it is germane to note the steps taken by police and retail stakeholders in response to the events of this case. The Safer Communities Task Group, operating under the umbrella of the Borough Crime Reduction Forum, provided incident logs and statements from affected retailers and their staff. The administrative record furnished by Ms Alice Laing, Crime Reduction Coordinator, is a model of clarity, and I wish to formally thank that office for its continuing support to the court and to the broader public interest.

I must also draw the court’s attention, briefly, to unrelated matters arising from the recent sitting of this court. Earlier this term we heard R v. Nipon [2025] EWCA Crim 995, a case involving burglary of a private dwelling, wherein the defendant entered a residential premises while the occupants were abroad, ransacking the interior and leaving behind significant damage. The facts there are wholly distinct, and the presence of such serious intrusion has no bearing on the facts before me; however, I cite the case in the spirit of comparing judicial reasoning as to aggravation and public impact in property offences more broadly.

Returning to the instant case, it must not be forgotten that the circumstances giving rise to police attention here were far from routine. Although the sequence of offending was spread over a brief period, the targeting of outlets in rapid succession, and the nature of the goods involved, suggest not a fleeting lapse in judgment, but a pattern of behaviour calculated to exploit both vulnerabilities in store procedures and the inadequacies of local policing resources.

The facts of the case are as follows.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

The court has additionally considered the issue of accomplices. Investigation revealed that your actions were unassisted; however, there is a tangential matter arising from police review, that a co-defendant—one Mr K. Adeyemi—was initially sought for questioning in connection with a separate event at a different retail premises on 12 March 2025, where the attempted theft escalated to assault on two security staff. Mr Adeyemi remains at large and is not before the court today. There is no evidence, direct or circumstantial, linking you to that separate event or to the use or threat of violence in any form.

Your arrest followed a coordinated operation involving officers from Wortley North Response Team and community support staff from the Wortley Retail Watch Alliance. The arrest was made without incident. The arresting officer’s body-worn video has been reviewed in chambers and confirms your compliant demeanour at the scene. No force was required, no resistance was offered, and your cooperation subsequently at interview is noted. A caution interview was conducted according to Code C of the PACE Codes of Practice, as certified by reviewing Inspector J. O’Hart.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

With respect to the period between your arrest and the present, I record that the matter was initially set down for sentencing on 8 July, then adjourned at the joint application of both parties to accommodate the urgent need for an updated psychiatric assessment. This was owing in part to a recent spell in the Wortley Community Treatment Unit, where you presented with symptoms suggestive of deteriorating mood and intermittent anxiety, as referenced in the supplementary report of Dr Killarney dated 29 June 2025. It is a sad yet routine feature of contemporary criminal process that the court must effectively operate as an extension of the mental health triage system, particularly in cases arising from or complicated by comorbidity of substance misuse and psychiatric disorder. The capacity of the NHS to respond appropriately to such dual diagnoses is, as ever, constrained by waiting lists, cross-boundary commissioning disputes, and the unrelenting pressure on inpatient beds. Reference is made, such as is necessary, to the strategic review of the Wortley Clinical Commissioning Partnership, whose June 2024 report detailed a 19% increase in criminal justice referrals since 2019.

I would further remark that the pre-sentence report prepared by Mr R. Tamil, Senior Probation Officer, is both detailed and professionally written. It is evident from the assessment interviews conducted with you on 3 and 11 August 2025 that, while you express some insight into the impact of your conduct, your engagement with rehabilitative pathways to date has been sporadic at best. I note that you failed to attend three out of five scheduled appointments with the Wortley Acquisitive Crime Project, and despite being signposted to the local branch of Turnaround Plus for debt and employment support, you declined to pursue the referral. Your stated barriers to engagement—namely, mistrust of professionals and a perceived lack of benefit—are disappointingly familiar to the court and underscore the ongoing challenge of providing tailored interventions in a context of scarce resources and limited voluntary uptake.

For completeness, I record that submissions were invited from the Wortley Small Traders Forum, who, whilst not directly involved in the loss event giving rise to these proceedings, have made written representations regarding the proliferation of low-level retail crime and its downstream impact on their capacity to remain solvent. These submissions, while general, provide useful context to the broader pattern of harm addressed by the courts.

The court has considered, in line with the guidance in R v. Bhandari [2023] EWCA Crim 412, the approach to sentencing in contested cases of repeated shop theft. Bhandari was an appeal arising from a complex matter involving the importation of controlled drugs concealed in freight vehicles and the subsequent resale of goods through shell companies. While the facts are extremely grave and bear no direct resemblance to the instant case, Bhandari reiterates that the existence of antecedent offending and the targeting of smaller enterprises may aggravate sentence even where the face value of the loss is modest.

I remind myself of the well-established principles in R v. McGuire [2019] EWCA Crim 1836, a fraud-related prosecution involving the exploitation of elderly residents in supported accommodation through the misuse of social care funds. McGuire is referred to here for its reminder that “sentencing must remain proportionate to culpability and harm, and not unconsciously escalate punishment solely on the basis of public anxiety or the perceived intractability of a given species of offending.” The present matter is not one of fraudulent financial manipulation, but the underlying caution as to measured response remains relevant.

You are now aged 43, of no fixed abode since March 2025, having undergone a period of sofa-surfing followed by emergency bed placement through the Wortley Urban Shelter Partnership. The pre-sentence report details a significant history of alcohol misuse, which you have, to your credit, partially addressed through sporadic engagement with the Alcohol Recovery and Motivation (ARM) group meetings led by Ms Gillian Plater. It is clear from your interview that there remain unresolved issues, both personal and practical, that have hampered your reintegration into stable employment and routine.

Your antecedents, as evidenced by the extract from the Police National Computer, record 18 previous convictions for theft-related matters, the most recent of which was a community order imposed on 4 December 2023 for possession of a bladed article in an unrelated incident involving a street altercation. I stress that you were not convicted of any assault in that event; the court is in possession of the transcript of sentencing remarks from HHJ Kavanagh confirming that, whilst you unlawfully possessed a knife, there was no evidence of your using or threatening to use it. Nonetheless, the presence of a recent conviction for a weapon-related offence remains a relevant, though not determinative, feature of your sentencing profile.

It is worth recording that a co-defendant in an earlier incident during 2022, Ms Priya Randhawa, is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment for criminal damage associated with graffiti attacks on the historic facade of Wortley Central Library—a fact which is not relevant to your present case, but which has been raised in public submissions as part of a pattern of so-called ‘quality of life’ offences.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

The court must view the present matter in the context of recent Home Office guidance, which expressly cautions against an over-reliance on immediate custodial disposal absent clear and compelling evidence that alternative sanctions would not secure rehabilitation or public protection. Notions of habituality or entrenched offending, while weighted in aggravation, do not in themselves preclude the possibility of compliance with structured community-based programmes. The report from the Wortley Probation Service makes clear, however, that your risk of reoffending is classed as ‘high’ without the imposition of a robust supervision element, and that you would benefit from participation in the Pathways Out of Crime initiative, subject to availability.

I pause, for completeness, to mention a procedural development adjacent to this case: the withdrawal of interpreter services at short notice from the Worford Circuit Court, necessitating the adjournment of all proceedings scheduled between 17 June and 5 July 2025. This, in turn, led to a compression of the Wortley list, and is a contributing factor to the current term’s severe congestion. The eventual listing of your case, whilst unfortunate in timing, reflects the current reality of judicial resource allocation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

The court is in receipt of a letter from your mother, Ms Tarana H., in which she describes your upbringing as punctuated by periods of educational disruption, family breakdown, and frequent exposure to street homelessness. She appeals for compassion in sentencing, noting that you have, in her words, “always struggled in environments that are loud, hostile, or unpredictable.” I do not disregard this plea. Nor do I discount your challenges. However, as the Sentencing Council has repeatedly emphasised, the function of mitigation is not to excuse persistent and deliberate offending, but to contextualise it.

The psychiatric report identifies symptoms of chronic dysthymia as well as low-level anxiety, with no evidence of active psychosis or major affective disorder. The psychiatrist concludes that you possess sufficient capacity to understand and comply with the requirements of a community order, but that compliance is “contingent upon persistent and structured support,” particularly in the initial months post-sentence.

The defence has referred the court to the now well-established principle from R v. Simmonds [2017] EWCA Crim 2729, in which the appellant’s sentence was recalibrated to reflect both the timing of the guilty plea and his unaddressed addiction. In Simmonds, the index offences comprised theft of copper wiring from commercial rail depots—again, factually distinct from the present situation—but the guidance as to weighting of mitigation was clear.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

It has become increasingly commonplace for the court to encounter defendants whose offending is shaped by the structural failings of local support services. I am advised that, in your case, attempts to secure stable private or housing association tenancy through the Urban Shelter Partnership have been frustrated by the ongoing reduction in available units and the protracted delays in securing even temporary placements. Waiting lists for the Anchor Employment Project now exceed six months, and the capacity of the NightSafe Outreach Team to deliver meaningful intervention has been severely compromised by recent funding cuts. These circumstances are unfortunately familiar, and whilst they add context, they cannot serve as an all-encompassing justification for serious criminal behaviour.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

It is pertinent to note—and I place it on record in the public interest—that the case management process in your case has been an outlier in terms of procedural continuity. Unlike so many similar matters before the court, there were no applications for bail variation, no significant delays arising from late or incomplete disclosure, and no need for a further adjournment owing to late defence expert instructions. Indeed, a word of thanks is due to both counsel and clerking staff for facilitating this degree of smooth running.

However, I must express my ongoing concern at the persisting administrative failures of the National Legal Aid Agency. The initial application for exceptional case funding to instruct Dr Killarney was returned on three separate occasions for minor technicalities, with no substantive justification for the delays. Such vacillations are now so much the norm that one fears the erosion of practitioner confidence in the system. It is my hope that this observation finds an audience at the relevant agency.

The court has been referred, finally, to the recent decision in R v. Elwood [2025] EWCA Crim 1543, arising from conviction for the importation of substantial quantities of Class A and Class B drugs. The factual matrix there—namely, concealment of substances within imported goods and co-ordinated resale through mobile distribution units—is far removed from the instant matter. The only relevance to the present sentencing exercise is as to the proper approach where late disclosure by the defence has led to contested mitigation. That is not the case here.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

I also note, per the representations of Mr Halim, your most recent attendance at Turnaround Plus was recorded as ‘actively engaged’, with positive feedback as to motivation and willingness to address offending-related needs. This is a tentative, but positive, factor in your favour.

There is also before the court a community impact statement provided by Mr Steve Willoughby, Chair of the North Wortley Neighbourhood Forum, testifying to the “widespread local frustration” at the persistent incidence of low-level, repeat shop theft. Mr Willoughby provides anecdotal evidence of multiple businesses being compelled to invest in fortified shutters, upgraded CCTV, and in some cases, reduce late-night opening hours—a sequence he attributes in part to “a feeling of abandonment by both police and local government.” The forum’s petition, cited in the bundle, records nearly 900 signatures; while it is not determinative, such community response is deeply concerning for both the strength and durability of the social contract.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

In sum, I am required to sentence you having regard to the Sentencing Council Guidelines, relevant authorities, and the statutory duty to consider the best interests of both the defendant and the broader public. The factual matrix shows deliberate, repeat offending against a backdrop of housing difficulty and partial engagement, aggravated by antecedents but modestly mitigated by late, but genuine, efforts to access support. This is not a case for immediate custody absent further exploration of alternatives.

I will therefore adjourn formal sentencing to permit the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report, to be provided within the standard 21-day timetable. The probation service is directed to report fully on the availability of structured community order requirements, to include consideration of the Pathways Out of Crime and Thinking Skills Programmes, with an emphasis on co-ordination between probation, housing, and mental health support services. No further submissions are required at this preliminary stage; the defendant remains remanded in conditional bail pending sentence. Sentencing is fixed for hearing in this court on 8 October 2025 at 10:00am.

These are the orders of the court.
