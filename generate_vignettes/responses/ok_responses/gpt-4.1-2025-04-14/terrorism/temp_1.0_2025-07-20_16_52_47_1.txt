IN THE CROWN COURT AT HARBOROUGH  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. HBC2025/41922  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Margaret S. Ivy  
Filed: 3 October 2025  

Mr H appears before this court for sentence in respect of four counts contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006 (preparation of terrorist acts) and one count under section 58(1)(b) of the Terrorism Act 2000 (collection of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism). The period to which the indictment relates extends from May 2023 to his arrest on 11 February 2025.

The factual and procedural chronology in this matter is, if I may, characteristically convoluted. The defendant was initially detained at his mother’s address in New Northborough, a short suburban terrace with an adjoining garage, following a targeted operation by East Midlands Counter Terrorism Command (“EMCTC”). That operation was supported by technical and forensic specialists from the Southfield Intelligence Integration Centre and, on the periphery, the Digital Scrutiny Desk at National HQ, whose report, incidentally, reached the court some six weeks later than scheduled due to a backlog caused in part by the unprecedented volume of urgent reviews emanating from cyber-enabled serious acquisitive crime across the region.

It should be emphasised at the outset that investigations of this nature routinely propel significant demands upon not only policing resources, but also upon the network of agencies that comprise the broader public protection infrastructure. During the early escalation phase, the Multi-Agency Panel for the Assessment of Risk (MAPAR) convened thrice: the records show the first such meeting on 15 February 2025 was, in point of curious detail, adjourned after nineteen minutes when the video-link audio misfunctioned owing to a district-wide outage affecting the Council’s VOIP servers. Such bureaucratic trivia might seem peripheral to the gravity of the present case, but they serve as harsh reminders of the daily logistical impediments that beset the administration of justice.

During the initial investigative stage, the defendant’s property was subject to comprehensive search powers under Schedule 5 to the Terrorism Act 2000. The warrant was executed at precisely 04:41, a time chosen so as to “minimise traffic on Greenwood Crescent,” according to the supervising Inspector’s case note, though—bizarrely—his own personnel then temporarily blocked the carriageway with an incorrectly parked police van, impeding early deliveries to the neighbouring bakery. Also found on site, in a seldom-used chest freezer in the adjoining garage, was a zippered sports bag containing a quantity of Super-8 cine films belonging to Mr H’s late grandfather, and three packets of vacuum-sealed yeast. Neither proved to be relevant to the charges, though the provenance of the yeast prompted an unsolicited letter from a member of the local historical society, seeking its donation to a forthcoming post-war culinary exhibition. The court can only note, with amusement, the unpredictable side effects of judicial process.

Counsel for the Crown, Ms Yeats, is to be thanked for an exhaustive opening substantially compressed to accommodate the regrettably late disclosure of technical evidence by the Atterton Lab. Mr Polzin, for the defence, has presented measured and detailed written submissions, including, most pertinently, the citation of psychiatric opinion not only from Dr Eversham, the jointly-instructed forensic consultant, but also from Dr Trudell, who, it should be noted, was compelled to withdraw midway through his report due to the collapse of his own private practice following a fire in his adjacent premises in April of this year. These administrative eccentricities, though seemingly tangential, have modestly delayed the receipt of full psychiatric analysis—a matter of some relevance to mitigation, as I will note below.

It is not the purpose of this court to offer sociological diagnosis, but the pattern is now familiar: terrorism cases, especially those involving digitally mediated conduct and “lone actor” radicalisation, expose the operational and conceptual limits of joined-up safeguarding. The minutes of the second MAPAR strategy meeting record concerns from the digital caseworker about persistent knowledge gaps regarding the interface between encrypted online communities and offline extremist mobilisation. The working party adjourned to seek supplementary training from the Secure Knowledge Liaison division, but—predictably—the course was oversubscribed, and it is yet to be completed.

I am compelled to record, if only for formality, that there remains a widespread and harmful misperception, fuelled at least in part by intemperate reportage on certain social platforms, that all individuals subject to terrorism proceedings are either intellectually vulnerable or the targets of state overreach. Such generalisations do little to illuminate the realities of cases like this, which are by their nature intricate and frequently resist simplistic narratives. Where proper and coordinated support services exist, they are often, as here, constrained by resource fatigue, risk aversion, and the labyrinthine complexity of overlapping statutory obligations.

On the procedural front, a bail application was heard before District Judge Omolu in the Borough Magistrates’ Court on 14 February 2025. An application for conditional bail—proposed on grounds of perceived family stability and a proffered GPS tag—was, not surprisingly, refused. The defence pointed to Mr H’s six-year history of voluntary work with a regional food bank, evidenced by a selection of carefully worded testimonials. While credit for public service is, in general, a mitigating feature, such service cannot countervail a sustained and sophisticated pattern of grievance-based extremism.

There was an early indication that the defendant intended to plead not guilty to all counts. A plea and trial preparation hearing was eventually listed for 16 April 2025, but was vacated following the defence’s application under section 8 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 for further disclosure of metadata from the encrypted hard drives seized at the scene. The court notes that the provision of technical documentation in this respect was hampered by the departure on sickness leave of the lead digital forensics examiner, who—unrelatedly—had previously been commended for her work in the prosecution of the “GreenFly” cybercrime syndicate in 2024.

Delays of the kind encountered in this case are, unfortunately, not rare. They are exacerbated by the continuing shortfall in technical staff available to the CPS Digital Evidence Reserve, a theme which finds frequent mention in professional working groups and, less usefully, in the editorial columns of specialist legal periodicals. The effective administration of justice in the digital era, I must observe, cannot rest on goodwill alone.

The context and charge, then, are to be situated in an evolving framework of terrorism legislation. The relevant statutes, including the Terrorism Act 2006 and the Terrorism Act 2000, have been significantly amended in recent years, most notably by the Counter-Terrorism and Sentencing Act 2021, which strengthened the scope for Extended Sentences for Public Protection (“ESPP”) and altered the activation thresholds for Schedule 18A offences. That reform was prompted, in part, by the serial failures in managing high-risk suspects highlighted in the aftermath of the Sudbury Bridge Attack (to which the current case, I stress, bears no factual relation). 

The Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences: Definitive Guideline (2023) provides an instructive matrix for calibrating culpability and harm. The spectrum of offending ranges from acts involving immediate risk to life, through to conduct situated at an earlier, preparatory phase. The guidelines highlight (at paragraph 1.10) the centrality of motivational intensity and evidential proximity to harm, as well as the sophistication of any attempted operational security measures.

In considering the application of the guideline, I have been referred to a series of appellate authorities, though most bear only partial contextual relevance. In R v Fahd [2022] EWCA Crim 2019, the Court was faced with a defendant who mailed quantities of industrial-grade chemical precursors, concealed within camera equipment, to contacts in Belgium and France. The sentence (an Extended Determinate Sentence of fifteen years, plus five on licence) was upheld, the court reiterating the intractable danger posed by those prepared to abuse technical expertise for ideological violence. While the factual matrix in Fahd is remote from that in the present case, the judgment reiterates the judicial principle that deterrence and incapacitation eclipse all other aims where public safety is concerned.

Similarly, in R v Henley [2021] EWCA Crim 785, a young man was convicted for attempting to disseminate, via multiple online channels, instructions for the construction of an “air-borne dispersal apparatus” initially developed for agricultural use. The relatively late guilty plea in Henley, whilst sparing some judicial resources, was entered at a point at which court time and public funds had already been substantially expended, and the sentencing reduction was calculated accordingly.

It has now become apparent in this jurisdiction that the trend towards last-minute guilty pleas—often entered only after a particularly adverse interlocutory ruling—represents a significant and growing burden upon the system. The criminal justice process, already groaning under the weight of overextended listing, suffers most acutely when defendants adopt what is best described as the “wait and see” approach to pleading. Whilst it is a constitutional right to test the Crown’s case, it is equally incumbent upon those who do so to accept that tactical delay in the face of overwhelming evidence cannot be the grounds for wholesale sentencing mitigation.

As was forcefully articulated in R v Linden [2023] EWCA Crim 3127, a case arising from a violent burglary on the Yorkshire circuit, the “timing, context and motivation” behind a late plea will be scrutinised and are not, of themselves, enough to trigger full credit. The defendant in Linden, having maintained his innocence for over nine months in the face of clear forensic and identification evidence, entered a plea only after a co-defendant gave a full confession. The judge awarded but 12% credit; the Court of Appeal upheld this as entirely justified, with the Lord Justice specifying that the “public utility” rationale for the traditional one-third reduction is not engaged where resources and hope have already been spent.

A further authority of marginal, though illustrative, value is R v Jafri [2022] EWCA Crim 87, concerning importation of controlled substances. There, the defendant’s attempt to mitigate via a pseudo-confessional letter was roundly dismissed as having “no discernible coherence or sincerity.” This court is thus duty-bound to consider not only the fact of a plea but also its quality, provenance, and impact upon the administration of justice.

Turning to the facts of the instant case.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

The Crown has submitted extensive technical analysis of the forensic evidence, the bulk of which was provided by digital investigators at the Southfield Intelligence Integration Centre (“SIIC”). Their work forms the backbone of the prosecution case and merits recognition, particularly given the volume of material reviewed—a not insubstantial 5.7 terabytes spread across three encrypted SSDs, a collection of USB “privacy keys,” and eight burned DVDs recovered from the defendant’s effects. By way of process, all material was processed via the SIIC’s Secure Host and then validated using SHA-256 hashing protocols. It is of passing procedural note that the SIIC is presently reliant upon code maintained by a single full-time Python programmer, whose recent planned retirement is said to imperil future capacity.

The defence submit, by way of partial mitigation, that the defendant’s engagement with extremist forums and encrypted communication channels demonstrated, if anything, a degree of “ideological confusion and self-isolation” rather than the hallmarks of committed, collective planning. While the court is prepared to accept that digital radicalisation frequently breeds insularity and resentment, this observation is ultimately of little assistance where the documented activity proceeds well beyond the passive consumption of propaganda.

It is a standing frustration of these cases that the public and indeed many officials labour under the illusion that online extremism is an ephemeral and unserious phenomenon, somehow distinct in nature and intent from its analogue predecessors. As became clear in R v Kersey [2019] EWCA Crim 422—a case of unauthorised access to the transport signalling mainframe, which I stress bore no elements of ideological or terrorism conduct—the blurring of online and offline boundaries is a defining feature of our age.

A brief procedural tangent: the first trial date was vacated after a threat of strike action by the National Union of Court Interpreters, affecting the provision of the rare Albanian dialect required by a witness extraneous to the principal evidence but whose testimony, on paper at least, touched on digital risk markers in analogous cases. The interpreter issue being resolved, the trial proceeded to the jury stage in Court 6, albeit three days behind the original listing.

In determining culpability, the Guideline identifies factors to be weighed in the context of sophistication, level of engagement, and proximity to carrying out acts capable of causing harm. Not all acts of terrorist preparation assume the same degree of immediacy or institutional threat. In the present matter, the Crown’s “harm” argument is advanced by reference to both quantity and content of digital evidence, as well as the temporal proximity of Mr H’s most recent activity to significant public events.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

Forensic technical analysis of Mr H’s internet search history, extracted from a device not initially listed on the police schedule, further revealed a prolonged pattern of late-night research sessions, timed to avoid detection from family members. The defendant’s browser logs, spanning 18 months, reflect repeated access to so-called “grey web” directories and cross-border forum chatter, much of it carried out via anonymising networks such as Tor and I2P.

It is necessary to put out of mind certain artefacts contemporaneously recovered from elsewhere in the household. The search warrant, as executed, also led officers to recover in a communal landing a large quantity of unopened gardening catalogues and a tote bag of children’s second-hand baseball caps dating from the early 2000s. The provenance of neither could be linked to Mr H. Similarly, mention was made by defence of a 2018 fixed penalty notice imposed on the defendant’s landlord for minor environmental infractions relating to refuse collection. These tangent details, though standard in the casing of digital warrants, are of no relevance to sentencing.

Reference was made by defence to the “Youth Diversion Order” imposed on a childhood acquaintance of Mr H’s for joyriding in a supermarket car park—again, no bearing on Mr H’s own conduct, nor on the issues before this court.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

The analysis of online correspondence in this case proved exceptionally laborious, a fact compounded by the recent imposition of a new data retention protocol by the third-party messaging app at the centre of the prosecution’s case. The court is informed, through the evidence of Mr Ian Netherby, senior digital forensics examiner, that a number of Mr H’s conversations were discovered only after a protracted “data recovery chain” requiring third-party subpoenas addressed to an intermediary cloud server in the Baltic States—the sort of jurisdictional merry-go-round now endemic to cross-border criminal justice in a digital age.

That forensic inquiry was itself delayed by a minor but frustrating event: the Atterton Lab’s main electrical panel suffered water ingress when a contractor, working on a non-related gas installation, neglected to seal an external junction box. The repair, funded by a combination of Home Office reserve grant and insurance payout, was completed in early June 2025, but the interruption resulted in a fortnight-long stoppage in all lab-based evidence handling.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

The Court notes for completion that amongst the other digital devices seized at the defendant’s address was a PlayStation 4 gaming console belonging to Mr H’s younger brother, which upon inspection contained only legitimate licensed video games and several gigabytes of innocuously banal holiday photographs from a family trip to the Lake District in 2019. An attempt by defence counsel to leverage the “normality” of family life as a mitigating circumstance does not withstand scrutiny in the present context.

It is worth reiterating, as the Crown has properly observed, that a well-regarded career, a loving family, or documented civic contributions are not, of themselves, sufficient to eclipse the seriousness of offences under the Terrorism Act. This is not to say character is irrelevant; it is to assert that its impact must be weighed proportionately.

The prosecution, in a submission preceded with commendable restraint, observed that Mr H’s acts cannot be dismissed as “culpable inattention,” such as where an individual is convicted inadvertently of a regulatory trespass—fly-tipping green waste on protected land, as in R v Shafiq [2021] EWCA Crim 1211, for example. Here, the conduct has the hallmarks of deliberateness, persistence, and planning.

The MAPAR multi-agency minutes record a consultation with Dr Gabriel Lott, a psychiatrist familiar to the court, who stated in terms that “the intersectionality of Mr H’s psychological profile and digital isolation may, at best, explain a genesis of vulnerability to conspiratorial rhetoric, but do not abrogate personal responsibility.” Dr Lott noted the absence of psychotic illness or formal diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorder; the “rigid cognitive style” observed, while potentially relevant to rehabilitation, affords only the most marginal assistance to mitigation.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

Forensic accounting analysis traced, with some effort, the origins of several cryptocurrency transactions linked to Mr H’s online activity. The Crown’s digital financial expert, Ms Joanne Farnby, described the use of obfuscating “mixing services” as “well beyond lay proficiency,” and submitted that the defendant’s financial acumen allowed him to mask the provenance of certain purchases. The central role of cryptocurrencies in contemporary digital offending is a phenomenon that continues to frustrate prosecutors and courts alike, notwithstanding the increasingly sophisticated tools now deployed by the National Crime Agency’s Digital Finance Taskforce.

It is only proper to record that of the ten cryptocurrency wallets investigated, three were found to contain nominal balances only, and two others were dormant for more than four years. This court is required to focus not on the existence of digital wallets per se, but on their functional role in the offending.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

The court wishes to place on record its appreciation of the tenacity demonstrated by the East Midlands High-Risk Supervision Unit, whose persistence in tracking cross-jurisdictional financial trails in this matter, despite considerable caseload fatigue, was remarked on by all parties. The unit’s progress was—unavoidably—impeded when their dedicated case lead was reassigned at short notice to a multi-force operation investigating the theft of copper wiring from several railway depots, an unrelated matter recently in the national news.

Turning now to the personal mitigation advanced on behalf of Mr H. He is 31 years old, educated to degree level, with a hitherto unremarkable history of employment as a technical clerk at the Stratton Engineering Collective, a firm recently placed in administration following the withdrawal of a key contract with a subsidiary of the Cumbrian Power Group. His supervisor describes him as “intelligent, self-contained, and possibly over-committed to abstract causes,” and notes that Mr H initiated and led a time-saving process-mapping exercise in late 2022—a contribution which, though outside the scope of the present charge, merits mention here, if only as background.

The defendant’s family background is largely stable. Letters submitted by his aunt and maternal cousin speak of a polite and quietly diligent young man, supportive of younger relatives, and “never one to raise his voice,” to quote the aunt’s phrase. There is, in this respect, an acute contrast between his public persona and the private digital conduct with which he is now charged.

The defence invited the court to credit not only Mr H’s volunteer service at a local shelter for survivors of domestic violence but also his 2016 fundraising effort for the Syston Wetlands Conservation Trust, for which he apparently completed two sponsored walks in full Victorian dress to raise local press attention. Civic engagement of this kind is, and always will be, a positive feature of character; but it cannot, nor should it purport to, offset the commission of acts of such gravity.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

The court is grateful for the detailed pre-sentence psychiatric report from Dr Eversham, who conducted three 60-minute clinical interviews with Mr H at Hilbridge Holding Centre. Dr Eversham’s assessment, in summary, is that Mr H meets criteria consistent with Avoidant Personality Traits and evidences longstanding experiences of social alienation, but does not suffer from a major mental illness or learning disability. The report advises that Mr H exhibits “strong ideological rigidity and a propensity for black-and-white moral thinking, which contextually increases the risk of recidivism absent significant and multi-modal intervention.”

The author of the social work report, Mr Dominic Caine, further notes that the Probation Service in this jurisdiction remains under “acute strain,” with high rates of staff turnover and less than 70% compliance with the recommended frequency of home visits in Category 3 MAPAR cases. This operational context should not be lost sight of when considering the practicalities of implementing any intensive community supervision.

On the issue of risk assessment, the evidence of Superintendent Mahindra, EMCTC, is clear: the defendant “will, if released without structured support, present an ongoing risk of serious harm to the public, most particularly in relation to digital-enabled offending.” There is an entrenched group identity, sustained through online echo chambers, that has yet “to fully abate” despite recent disengagement from flagged channels. The court is thus satisfied, applying the structured assessment frameworks of OASys and Extremism Risk Guidance (ERG 22+), that the present risk cannot presently be managed except within the custodial estate.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

Aggravating features in this case include the professional-level encryption used to conceal material, the deliberate evasion of digital profiling through anonymising browsers, and the international dimension reflected in cross-border contact with individuals in proscribed organisations. The court must mark such escalation and sophistication in the clearest terms.

Mitigation, as noted, is confined to the defendant’s lack of previous convictions, his sustained volunteering, certain elements of personal character and a consistent, if belated, acceptance of guilt as expressed in his written apology to the court. The lateness of his plea means that the credit cannot exceed 15 percent, in line with established sentencing practice.

The court orders the preparation of a full pre-sentence report to address the feasibility of an Extended Determinate Sentence pursuant to section 226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and to consider the suitability of accredited Deradicalisation Programmes operated by the National Probation Service, as well as the capacity for approved premises monitoring and multi-agency Risk Management Panels post-release. The report should, in addition, canvass the potential for postgraduate psychological input under the Joint Security-HMP Framework, options for structured employment initiatives, and access to specialist digital risk reduction interventions. The court expresses no settled view other than that public protection and reduction of risk must remain paramount.

These remarks are issued this day, 3 October 2025, in Court 2 at the Crown Court at Harborough. They are transcribed and recorded in accordance with Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The record of conviction and sentence will be registered with the relevant authorities. 

These are the orders of the court.
