IN THE CROWN COURT AT BRISTOL
R v. Mr H
Case No. B2025/11238
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge F. J. CARTWRIGHT
Filed: 16 September 2025

Mr H stands before this court for sentence in connection with two counts arising under the Terrorism Act 2006: namely, engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a), and possession of a document or record likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to section 58(1)(b). The conduct spans a period extending from February 2023 through to the date of his arrest in March 2025.

To situate the case properly, it is incumbent upon the court to record the procedural journey to this hearing. Mr H was initially arrested at 07:24 hours on 17 March 2025 when officers from Counter Terrorism Policing South West, acting under warrant issued pursuant to section 43B of the Terrorism Act 2000, executed a coordinated entry at his then-address of residence, 17 The Barns, Midsomer Norton. The arrest followed a multi-agency investigation—Operation TALLOWCREST—undertaken by a cockpit of agencies including the National Crime Agency's Counter-Terrorism Command, the Avon and Somerset Police Technical Forensics Unit, and external consultants seconded briefly from the Home Office Digital Exploitation Centre. The intersection of local and national capability, as shown here, remains both a testament to the evolving complexity of terrorist threat management and an indicator—if any were needed—of the resource intensiveness governing such modern investigations.

The arrest warrant was secured following a mix of digital and human intelligence. The prosecution adduced evidence at trial of extensive forensic recovery: over two terabytes of encrypted digital data, partially recovered from network-attached storage concealed in a locked utility cupboard, and a suite of messaging exchanges obtained through legal process from overseas service providers. It is necessary to record that all digital search and seizure actions were conducted in accordance with the prevailing requirements of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Schedule 5 of the Terrorism Act 2000, and applicable Home Office digital handling guidance, as independently attested by the head of technical forensics, Mr A. Lawlor.

Particular delay was occasioned by the requirement for the Home Office International Liaison Unit to negotiate access to otherwise lawfully held encrypted data residing on cloud servers hosted outside the UK. Despite the Crown’s repeated written representations to their foreign counterparts, a reply permitting evidential access was not forthcoming until five months after the initial application. Defence have argued that Mr H suffered prejudice due to the length of his remand pending full charging. This was addressed in open court, and while the delay is regrettable, the court is satisfied that all appropriate steps towards expedition were taken. In the final analysis, any prejudice was no greater than is, unhappily, commonly found in cases of this seriousness and complexity.

It was at the first plea and trial preparation hearing, convened on 21 April 2025, that Mr H, then represented by Ms Aurelia Tovey of Portman Chambers under a Legal Aid Agency certificate, indicated through counsel that his intention was to plead “not guilty” on all charges. That position was maintained through the initial stages of evidence service, forensic testing of key data assets, and disclosure of the psychiatric assessment. Only following this court’s ruling on the admissibility of covert audio surveillance evidence—specifically, the twelve hours of recordings secured from a listening device deployed under a property interference authorisation—did Mr H, at a further directions hearing on 18 August 2025, notify the court via counsel of his intention to plead guilty. The lateness of the plea is, for reasons I shall explain, significant in considering sentence reduction.

The court notes—regrettably, but as is increasingly frequent—that the case was listed and re-listed on three separate occasions between May and July 2025, each time at the request of either the Crown Prosecution Service’s Counter-Terrorism Division, owing to delays in expert report receipt, or as a result of the intermittent unavailability of instructed counsel due to ongoing industrial action by the Criminal Bar. The repeated rearrangement of hearings has, it should be made plain, not only lengthened the interval between initial charge and sentence, but contributed to the mounting strain upon the court's limited resources. The pressures are familiar to all regular court users, but they nonetheless bear formal record, for they affect, materially and symbolically, the credibility of the justice process in cases of such consequence.

Despite various adjournments, the court is obliged to commend the conduct of both prosecution and defence. The advocate for the Crown, Mr Malik Pinder, whose written skeleton argument bore all the hallmarks of clarity and brevity sadly absent from much modern legal drafting, and defence counsel, Ms Tovey, who advanced her client’s case throughout with measured dignity and a principled refusal to indulge in rhetorical flourish. The court also records its gratitude to the support staff who have—amid ongoing staffing gaps due to COVID-related absences and, more generally, the all-too-familiar attrition of qualified personnel—sustained an orderly running of the list on several occasions when the court’s technical infrastructure failed.

Public scrutiny of the system's efficacy has rarely been more searching, nor its verdicts more fraught. It is against this backdrop that we must locate the present case—a case whose implications cannot be confined to the private sphere, but radiate through the fabric of civic trust itself.

Attention is frequently drawn to high-profile terrorist cases tried in the higher courts, but the majority of the counter-terrorism caseload comprises, as here, cases of what has been variously described as “self-radicalisation”, “loner extremism”, or “online echo-chamber incitement”. Such terminology, while useful for the policy-maker, risks obscuring the granular complexity presented by each individual before the court. The challenge of sentencing in such cases is to distinguish between the motivational roots and operational maturity of the defendant’s conduct, whilst resisting the temptation either to sensationalise or to understate the substantial real-world danger such conduct can pose.

In the present matter, psychiatric and psychological reports have been central to the defence’s approach. The first such report, prepared by Dr Leonie Slade, MBBS, MRCPsych, and filed with the court on 11 June 2025, drew attention to the presence of underlying depressive symptoms, a history of social isolation, and what she described as a “pattern of ruminative-concretist thinking consistent with vulnerability to ideological capture.” The subsequent report, from Professor Alan Mintram, commissioned directly by the defence, found no evidence of “formal psychosis or major affective disorder,” and concluded that Mr H was, at all material times, aware of the nature and legality of his conduct. In short, he was fit to plead, to stand trial, and, in the view of the joint forensic interview panel, free from diagnosable mental illness barring a moderate social anxiety disorder.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

It is also noted that a Prevent referral was initiated concerning Mr H as long ago as September 2018, when a former lecturer at Somerset College became concerned by essays submitted under pseudonyms, alongside postings on a message board later identified as being linked to so-called “alt-right” movements. The Channel panel determined, at the time, that risk thresholds were not met for structured intervention. Hindsight, as this court is all too aware, is a seductive and unhelpful frame for the second-guessing of such decisions; the tools for early intervention remain limited in both predictive value and resourcing.

To the facts established at trial. The prosecution’s case relied heavily upon technical data, including digital forensic analysis undertaken by the National Digital Exploitation Service. The involvement of an international advisory team became necessary due to the use by Mr H of custom-built encrypted messaging applications on a modified operating system—a fact which, though it may seem arcane to the lay observer, has become almost banal in contemporary terrorism matters.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

It is right to observe, parenthetically, that the prosecution’s expert witness, Dr Carolina Osei, MAE, was cross-examined at length upon the limits of digital file attribution, given the use of open-source anonymisation tools and distributed file synching techniques. The court is satisfied, having heard all evidence, that the report findings are to be preferred over the defence expert, whose own curriculum vitae included no prior engagement in criminal proceedings, and who, when challenged on the provenance of a software script, was forced to concede reliance on forum posts rather than original technical documentation.

It was also established that a series of purchases made via cryptocurrency were consistent with the procurement of components useful both in the context of Mr H’s hobbyist electronics interests and in the commission of acts as alleged. Defence submissions endeavoured to characterise these transactions as the mere flotsam of the proliferating “maker” economy; the court remains unmoved by the proliferation of do-it-yourself content on internet platforms as a free-standing justification, especially where the coalescence of purchases aligns so closely with the operational profile of prior attack methodologies.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Extensive argument was heard regarding whether the defendant’s online persona—identified on several extremist-adjacent forums and message boards—amounted to a material indicator of intent, or was, as the defence would have it, a form of irony or “dark satire.” The court has little patience for the invocation of parody as an exculpatory device in the context of consistent and unambiguous advocacy for violence. Parody resides, if it resides at all, in the clear presence of a disjuncture between statement and belief; here, that line is not one the court discerns.

Thorough case management was rendered more difficult by the scale of the disclosure exercise. The case generated in excess of 1,800 primary exhibits, including 372 separate digital items requiring sequential, and at times recursive, redaction to comply with both public interest immunity and, more prosaically, the outdated hardware still underwriting the court’s own IT infrastructure. System downtime, repeated failures in the court’s evidence-sharing portal, and the frequent necessity for counsel to work from paper bundles have created a procedural burden that is as familiar as it is lamentable. The willingness of all present to persevere under these conditions merits the court’s express gratitude.

The principles governing reduction in sentence for guilty plea were considered in R v. Abdulrasheed [2024] EWCA Crim 367, where the Court of Appeal reaffirmed the principle that maximum credit is reserved for those entering a guilty plea at the first reasonable opportunity. The defendant in that matter maintained not guilty pleas through the entire pre-trial process, altering his plea only after the court rejected his application to have a vital intercept excluded. Only a modest reduction in sentence was permitted. Similarly, in R v. McKenzie [2022] EWCA Crim 1816, the defendant, charged with possession of explosives with intent at his South London bedsit, received 12.5% credit for a very late plea, following adverse pre-trial rulings and after the Crown had completed all witness warning letters and exhibit triage.

In a further illustrative case, R v. Pollock [2021] EWCA Crim 2417, the defendant was charged with burglary and criminal damage after entering the private home of a retired couple while they were absent on holiday. Despite compelling CCTV evidence and trace forensic contact with the window frame, the defendant refused to admit to the offence until the morning of trial, resulting only in a ten percent deduction given the distress and preparation required of witnesses up to that point. While Pollock relates to property crime, the principle as to the rationale and calibration of credit is common to serious offending of all kinds.

Another instructive sentencing case involves R v. Howlett [2023] EWCA Crim 1392, concerning the use of encrypted messaging apps to facilitate the importation of Class A drugs in bulk. The facts involved a conspiratorial operation whereby Mr Howlett, a pallet delivery driver, orchestrated the discreet movement of multiple parcels containing cocaine and ketamine via his company’s logistics platforms. Despite compelling cell site and text evidence, the defendant maintained his denial until after a successful application by the Crown to admit associational evidence from co-defendants’ mobile devices. Again, a reduction in sentence for guilty plea was limited to just over one-eighth, reinforcing the point that opportunistic or tactical pleas attract only limited mitigation.

A further, though only tangentially relevant, fact pattern can be seen in R v. Osman [2021] EWCA Crim 1278, where a suspended sentence was imposed following the theft of copper cable from a railway depot, resulting in substantial disruption to local commuter services. The case is mentioned here for completeness; the factual scenario differs in salient respects but it highlights the court’s general reluctance to extend maximum leniency where disruption to public services has been substantial, even in the absence of physical violence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

During argument, the defence placed considerable emphasis on Mr H’s early educational achievements, the absence of previous convictions, and a series of testimonials from former employers in the voluntary and charitable sectors. Of particular note were the letters from the South Somerwell Community Centre and the Beehive Allotment Trust. These were measured in tone and did not seek to excuse his behaviour, but rather to contextualise his “capacity for engagement” within a wider history of community involvement. It does the writers credit that they plainly resisted any temptation to minimise the seriousness of the present matter.

Equally, though, the court is bound to acknowledge the theoretical framework established by R v. Donaghue [2022] EWCA Crim 1753, which reaffirmed that civic merit and apparent rehabilitation are not free-standing defences to gravely antisocial or violent conduct. In Donaghue, the defendant’s substantial pro bono work in supporting youth literacy programming in Newcastle was not considered to materially reduce the seriousness of his fraud offences, involving as they did calculated deceit and substantial harm. Good character, while always relevant, is but one strand in the sentencing matrix.

Further, reference is made to the procedural context occasioned by the participation of Safeguarding and Prevent partners at all stages subsequent to remand. The Local Authority Channel Panel, in communication with probation, generated a risk assessment in May 2025, determining Mr H posed an “elevated risk of recidivism in the event of unsupervised release.” The decision letter from that panel has been reviewed and its conclusions adopted insofar as they speak to the need for robust and ongoing post-custodial management.

The court is, at this stage, drawn to consider the substance of the presentencing report, which was prepared with, it must be said, some difficulty by probation staff operating under caseload pressure and in the shadow of recent staffing losses linked to the closure of approved premises in the greater Bristol area. The report highlights Mr H’s “intense preoccupation with technological competence, and a markedly binary interpretative schema for assessing social injustices.” These psychological features are said to be not uncommon among defendants presenting for sentencing in matters involving a mix of technological sophistication and ideological grievance.

It is noted that probation, while flagging several “community integration opportunities,” was forced to admit that resource constraints mean digital monitoring and specialist counter-extremism mentorship programming is, for practical reasons, only intermittently and patchily available in the South West. Whether such scarcity should be mitigation or damning, I leave for others. The court can only sentence on the realities as they exist, rather than as might be wished.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

A detailed multi-agency meeting, convened under MAPPA arrangements on 22 August, reviewed practicalities of managing “Category 3 risk” posed by Mr H, in anticipation of eventual release. The meeting notes indicate a consensus for the imposition of electronic monitoring, tightly drawn exclusion zones, and high-frequency reporting, contingent upon the length and nature of any custodial term to be imposed. The court expresses for the record its gratitude to Detective Inspector Freema Batters (Counter Terrorism Policing SW) and Senior Probation Officer Maya Reynard for their clarity of analysis and unstinting attention to detail.

The court is not blind to the wider climate in which it presently operates. Public concern over the extent and speed of radicalisation in digital spaces is met with a chorus of suggestions, from “greater police powers” to “more surveillance” or even “algorithms for early detection.” Such criticisms miss the more prosaic reality: progression into actionable threat requires not only intent, but capability and preparation—none of which are susceptible to the simple application of technological fixes in the absence of human diligence, technical skill, and sufficient line resources.

The issue of public protection, which both the authorities and the wider community rightly place at the front of their minds, is not answered by rhetoric, nor, regrettably, by information technology unmoored from professional oversight.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

The careful balancing exercise to which I am required to turn is set out in the Sentencing Council’s Terrorism Offences Definitive Guideline (2023 revision). The legislative maximum for section 5(1)(a) offences is life imprisonment; for section 58 matters, it is 15 years. The court is required to assess culpability, intent, and the risk posed to the public, contrasting statutory maximums with the particular nature of the offending before it, as interpreted through the authoritative case law—R v. Kahar [2016] EWCA Crim 568, R v. Gul [2013] UKSC 64, and R v. Alahmedalabdaloklah [2019] EWCA Crim 678 prominent among them.

The aggravating and mitigating features here are familiar. Among aggravating factors: the sustained operational intensity of the defendant’s preparation, the sophistication of the means deployed to avoid detection, the explicit targeting of civilian sites, and the clear intention to cause fear and disruption on a scale that, while not actually realised, was carefully planned for. On the other side of the ledger, mitigating circumstances include the absence of previous criminal convictions, the modest but meaningful engagement in community service, the presence of moderate mental health challenges, and the strong support network evidenced by correspondence to the court.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

The report of Dr Mintram, to which I referred earlier, concludes that while Mr H presents “no axis I or axis II psychiatric disorder warranting therapeutic containment,” he demonstrates “persistent cognitive rigidity and susceptibility to grievance-driven ideation.” The multi-agency risk forum rate him as “high risk, but manageable within appropriately structured statutory oversight.” The court is cognisant that engagement with deradicalisation programmes, while theoretically available, is uneven in its outcomes. The submission by defence that simple community-based supervision could suffice does not, on the evidence before the court, meet the threshold for public protection.

It is customary to note, at this final stage, the series of letters, communications, and submissions received from various community, faith, and family stakeholders, including the Somerwell Interfaith Council, who urged particular sensitivity in the application of sentence. These have been read and given appropriate weight. The court remains of the view, however, that public protection and the objectives of deterrence, denunciation, and, where possible, rehabilitation must be determinative.

Accordingly, having heard all relevant submissions, and having reviewed the evidence, the pre-sentence report, and psychiatric opinions in detail, I am not prepared to proceed to sentence today. The volume and complexity of the case, together with the ongoing advice from statutory agencies as to risk management, require me to order a comprehensive updated pre-sentence report, to be prepared by Bristol Probation Service in consultation with the regional MAPPA board. That report is to address the viability of extended sentence structures, the possible imposition of Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIMs) upon release, and the suitability of participation in the Desistance and Disengagement Programme. I will fix the matter for final sentencing upon receipt of that report, at a date not earlier than six weeks hence.

These are the orders of the court.
