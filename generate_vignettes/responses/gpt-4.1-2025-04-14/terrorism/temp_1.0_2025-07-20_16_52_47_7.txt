IN THE CROWN COURT AT SOUTHWARK
Case No: S2026/37388
R v. Mr H
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge Eleanor K. Ashton
Filed: 2 October 2026

Mr H, you appear today before this court for sentence in respect of two counts: the first, of engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) of the Terrorism Act 2006; the second, of possessing material likely to be useful to a person preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The conduct in question traverses the period from November 2024 to your apprehension in late April 2026. These proceedings have been the culmination of a protracted, multi-agency investigation, combining traditional surveillance with the deployment of contemporary digital analytic techniques and cross-border cooperation.

Your arrest occurred at 04:07 on 28 April 2026, at an address in Sydenham, South London—a first-floor flat sublet in apparent breach of tenancy by-laws, a detail ultimately immaterial to these proceedings but redolent of the untidiness that often accompanies risk-laden lifestyles. The warrant was executed under s.43(1) of the Terrorism Act 2000, having been secured upon sworn evidence of persistent digital communication between yourself and overseas actors of concern, as well as forensic traces implicating you in the orchestration of encrypted file transfers. Much has been made of the resources marshalling for your apprehension: a joint taskforce comprising the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command (SO15), the South London Cyber Exploitation Unit, and three analysts seconded from the Home Office Data Fusion Centre. Their efforts, whilst successful, exacted a perceptible toll on their respective institutions, all of which are currently operating at or near statutory minimum staffing levels.

It is a recurring theme of modern criminal justice that complex investigations strain not only financial and technical resources, but also institutional resilience. It is perhaps unsurprising that a diversion of analytical capacity to your case required the temporary postponement of multiple parallel inquiries—including, as the court records, ongoing investigations into coordinated “smash and grab” retail crime groups in Dulwich and a spike in arson attacks on municipal refuse bins in the borough of Wandsworth. The reality, too infrequently acknowledged in public discourse, is that the energy required to investigate and disrupt terrorism is inevitably drawn from a finite pool—every hour spent decoding VPN logs and cross-referencing Cloud infrastructure is, by consequence, an hour wrested from the pursuit of urgent matters elsewhere.

The procedural journey of this prosecution illustrates the difficulties posed by the glacial progress of timely disclosure, exacerbated by the incorporation of evidence gathered by non-UK authorities. In your case, a Letter of Request under the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 was issued to German authorities for the recovery of data from remote servers one of your IP addresses accessed via a relay node in Leipzig. The resulting delay—prescribed by the mutual legal assistance treaty to not less than 56 days—in part accounts for your being subject to two successive periods of conditional bail under the imprimatur of the District Judge at Camberwell Green Magistrates’ Court.

The timeline of your plea demands careful judicial comment. You first appeared in this court on 4 June 2026. At the initial plea and trial preparation hearing, you entered not guilty pleas to all charges. It was only following the service of the prosecution’s digital evidence schedule, containing expert reports from the National Digital Exploitation Centre and after your legal team’s unsuccessful application to exclude certain covert product on the grounds of alleged unlawful authorisation, that you indicated a willingness to plead guilty to a subset of the indictment. The official record shows a formal indication of guilty pleas was not entered until 21 September 2026—the very morning trial was listed to commence and after the swearing of the jury panel. It follows that the utilitarian benefit of that plea is sharply circumscribed.

As was made clear in R v. Qureshi [2024] EWCA Crim 1965, the sentencing discount to be afforded for a guilty plea must reflect not merely the act of admission but the timing of that act and the extent to which it spares witnesses and public resources. In that case, a defendant charged with maliciously causing explosions—arising from pipe bomb incidents in Derbyshire—maintained a not guilty plea through nine months of pre-trial hearings, effecting a late change only after judicial rulings on key evidential points. The Court of Appeal endorsed the trial judge’s decision to allow a reduction no greater than 10%, having found the plea to be motivated by expediency rather than any genuine expression of contrition or responsibility.

Similarly, in sentencing cases of aggravated burglary such as R v. Broughton [2023] EWCA Crim 1042, it was impressed upon courts that the endurance of complainant anxiety and the protracted mobilisation of trial resources merit only modest reductions in sentence where a late plea renders those burdens, in effect, unrecoverable. The principle is directly apposite here: your admissions, however advised or calculated, offer only limited mitigation for the thoroughgoing involvement of court personnel, technical experts, and the carriage of the matter to the very threshold of contested hearing.

Before considering the factual matrix of your offending in further detail, I am bound to record a number of ancillary procedural events that, whilst peripheral, do provide insight into the condition of the justice process. Notable among them was the late filing of a psychiatric report occasioned by the under-resourcing of the Secure Remand Assessment Service. It is, I regret to say, now so routine as to go almost unremarked that such reports arrive mere days prior to listed hearings, imperilling fair preparation for both prosecution and defence. The court recognises and commends the efforts of Dr Malcolm Shadwick, whose submission was both comprehensive and thoughtfully argued despite his exercise of duty during a three-week period of staff absences resulting from a cluster of COVID-25 cases in the Trust.

I further note, for completeness, a number of character references tendered on your behalf. These included letters from a resettlement initiative led by St Martin’s Community Church in New Eltham and two submissions from the East Sydenham Youth Allotment Project. While the desirable conduct attributed to you during your sporadic engagement with these organisations is noted, it does not serve as an effective counterweight to the premeditation and ideological fervour underpinning your criminality. Civic engagement, useful in the ordinary calculus of mitigation, loses all proportional explanatory power when juxtaposed against offences motivated, as here, by entrenched beliefs in the necessity of causing mass harm.

It is a truism that late service of certain forms of evidence can operate against the interests of all parties and the administration of justice. In this case, the Crown disclosed by list S-16 a series of “OneSearch” vehicle history checks tying hire vans to your known aliases—a process complicated by the retention of outdated address information for you held by the DVLA. The reliability of such checks was the subject of detailed submission by defence counsel, whose diligence in pursuing every available avenue for your benefit is recorded with approval by the court.

It is also right to state, for the avoidance of future confusion, that a minor quantity of herbal cannabis was found within a locked cabinet belonging to one of your co-tenants. Although the property fell within the physical perimeter of your bedroom, and although you were present at the time of seizure, the Metropolitan Police confirm that no charge was brought in that regard and that there is no suggestion this court treats the discovery as aggravating your culpability or exposing you to additional criminal sanction. I underline this to avoid later miscitation by careless readers of the case papers.

A more substantial red herring emerges from the fact that, during the investigation of your digital devices, one backup file inadvertently implicated your sister in a long-resolved benefit fraud investigation dating back to 2020. For the record, and to forestall gossip, I confirm that neither you nor your immediate family are under any active investigation in that regard, and that the occurrence is both coincidental and legally irrelevant. The time and effort expended by SO15 in liaising with Department for Work and Pensions Fraud Division to close that loop is, however, yet another testament to how criminal investigations rarely unfold along singular, linear paths.

The court is reminded, by virtue of the submissions of Mr Lawrence, counsel for the Crown, of increasingly protracted legal argument concerning the use of evidence derived from the Remote Warranting Process. As the courts of England and Wales have repeatedly recognised—notably in R v. Janusz [2022] EWCA Crim 454—a warrant obtained under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 is not defective merely because supporting documentation was scanned in the wrong format or upheld by an acting justice rather than a sitting circuit judge at an early hour on a Sunday. Administrative imperfection, while preferable to avoid, does not vitiate investigative lawfulness unless substantial prejudice is caused or statutory conditions are not met. The defence’s argument to the contrary is, with respect, without merit.

The procedural and disclosure history is not without its labyrinthine episodes, including a mistaken listing of this case for trial in Courtroom 2A owing to an administrative input error. This resulted in the simultaneous, and entirely unrelated, trial of a co-defendant in a neighbouring housing matter—specifically, an allegation of illegal subletting contrary to the Prevention of Social Housing Fraud Act 2013. The confusion prompted temporary delay and a brief adjournment, costing a reported £750 in wasted costs. No prejudice accrued to your position as a result, but the episode symbolises the present fragility and complexity of court listing practices attendant to chronic underinvestment in the judicial estate.

It is a further feature of these proceedings that defendant’s initial legal representation by Mr. O’Hara of O’Hara & Slee Ltd was terminated when errors came to light regarding professional accreditation—errors arising after an unrelated regulatory matter concerning professional indemnity insurance in family law not criminal litigation. You were subsequently represented by Ms Natalie Kim, whose stewardship of your defence has been notably effective, particularly in preparation for the defence psychiatric assessment phase and argument upon basis of plea.

It is never amiss for courts to engage briefly with the wider context in which terrorist offences are committed and prosecuted. There persists, in both political and media commentary, a tone of both panic and fatigue concerning the proliferation of ideologically motivated violence. Anxiety around lone-wolf radicalisation, the catalytic potential of encrypted online fora, and the destabilising effects of cross-border propaganda is now a daily staple of public debate. The judicial function, however, requires vigilance not merely against the deeds themselves but against alarmism that risks undermining due process and objectivity. Sentences must neither capitulate to public hysteria nor blithely understate the risks posed by committed, resourceful offenders. It is important to reiterate that the function of the court is not to serve as social diagnostician or moral arbiter; it is to impose sentences commensurate with culpability and harm, in accordance with statutory and guideline authority.

Reference may usefully be made to the decision in R v. Marshall [2025] EWCA Crim 2083, which concerned the use of self-manufactured explosives deployed in an attempt to intimidate a community centre. While the offending was exceptionally grave—aggravated by the targeting of a protected minority—the Court of Appeal emphasised careful separation between background political climate and the facts necessary for proof of the relevant criminal offence. The defendant’s late change of plea was afforded only limited credit given the volume of evidence marshalled for trial, the cost and anxiety experienced by witnesses, and the irretrievable investment of resources.

In this case, expert evidence was furnished by Ms Gabrielle Ekwueme, Principal Forensic Analyst at the National Digital Exploitation Centre, whose report was delayed by pressures arising from a major cyber-attack on the Centre’s core data archive, necessitating manual review of thousands of casework requests. The court is grateful for her diligence, as well as for her attendance on very short notice for live cross-examination on points of technical nuance regarding PGP key management and mirroring of deleted server partitions.

For the record, and to avoid misconception, an issue was canvassed in passing regarding the presence of a duplicate bank card in the defendant’s flat, which subsequent investigation established belonged to a now-estranged housemate. It was used neither for financial crime nor, as sometimes occurs, to facilitate so-called “banking mule” arrangements. That line of inquiry was closed swiftly after the rightful owner attended voluntary interview.

Reference should next be made, albeit with caution, to several cases cited by counsel for their analogy to the present matter. Among these, R v. Chowdhury [2023] EWCA Crim 1592, concerned a defendant who conspired to import 2.8 kg of heroin concealed within furniture consigned from Rotterdam. Though the criminality was severe, the principle extracted concerned only the admissibility of covert search evidence and not the terrorist planning observed here. Similarly, in R v. Green [2021] EWCA Crim 1913, a youthful defendant was convicted of aggravated criminal damage having set fire to a church noticeboard as an act of adolescent protest. The relevance of these authorities to the facts at bar is, with respect, minimal—though their reference is, as ever, welcome for the sake of procedural thoroughness.

Turning now to your personal circumstances. Mr H, you are 31 years of age. The pre-sentence report details your academic and employment background, noting a degree awarded with distinction in electronic engineering from a respected London university, and a period of remunerated employment as a systems technician at Kingston Data Systems until June 2024, when you resigned following a dispute about compliance with the "Prevent Duty" risk assessment protocols then newly introduced in your workplace. Colleagues describe you as "quiet, technically proficient, and intensely private." Your engagement with community-based deradicalisation initiatives has been inconsistent and superficial—a matter addressed more fully by the forensic psychology report of Dr Pranav Alvi, dated 16 September 2026.

I note that, amongst the character references submitted by your defence, special mention was made of your past volunteering with the Lewisham Family Soup Kitchen. The organiser, Ms Valérie Qualls, attests to your "reliable stewardship of night shelter sign-in sheets and calm demeanour under pressure." This is to your credit, but in the court’s assessment does little to mitigate risk in the present context. Indeed, where an individual who enjoys public trust concurrently nurtures violent ideological aims, that trust is not merely forfeited—it is, if anything, aggravated by the breach.

The matter of mental health, routinely relevant in sentencing exercises of this sort, was comprehensively covered in the 11-page assessment delivered by Dr Alvi and in the corresponding psychiatric risk screening performed under the auspices of the Community Forensic Outpatient Service. Dr Alvi found no evidence of underlying psychosis, neurodevelopmental disorder, or clinically significant trauma. He did, however, observe "persistent and significant cognitive rigidity manifesting as an incapacity to assimilate divergent worldviews," alongside a social isolation notable for "paranoid apprehension regarding institutional authority." While these characteristics raise concern for future risk, they do not constitute mental impairment of such a nature as to require alternative disposal under the Mental Health Act.

As required, I have considered the question of possible rehabilitation under structured community supervision. The court received submissions from the Southwark Prevent Hub, whose practitioners, in accordance with policy set out in the Channel framework, attempted engagement with Mr H by way of motivational interviewing and tailored cognitive behavioural interventions. Participation was sporadic and regularly punctuated by an abrupt suspension of contact on your part; the record shows a single occasion where, following the first group session on 11 July 2025, you absconded before individual intake was complete. The Crown contends, and I accept, that the prospect of successful deradicalisation under voluntary supervision alone is—based on current evidence—vanishingly small.

The preponderance of aggravating features in this case is clear. They include the methodical planning involved, the sophistication of digital obfuscation undertaken, and the procurement of potentially lethal materials through third-party online vendors. You exploited cutting-edge encryption tools and deliberately circumvented reasonable attempts at engagement by counter-terror professionals. Mitigation is limited to your otherwise clean antecedent history, your academic attainment, a history of non-violent civic participation, and to a lesser extent, your eventual plea of guilty; as I have already found, the lateness of that plea substantially confines its value.

I make clear, for all parties, that the present case engages the highest culpability bracket as defined in the Sentencing Council’s 2023 guidelines for terrorism offences. As in R v. Lee [2025] EWCA Crim 981, the principal objectives of deterrence, incapacitation, and the maintenance of public order are paramount in calibrating sentence. Extended determinate or life sentences have routinely been imposed where pre-offence risk management has failed to divert ideologically motiviated offenders from preparatory acts, and where intent to commit mass harm is strongly evidenced.

In these circumstances, I direct the preparation of a comprehensive pre-sentence report. The National Probation Service is to assess the suitability of an Extended Determinate Sentence under s.226A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, to include consideration of DOORS-based risk management, GPS exclusion technology, continuation of MAPPA Category 3 oversight, and—if appropriate—the applicability of the Desistance and Disengagement Programme alongside multi-agency risk assessment panels. The court will convene a further sentencing hearing upon receipt of that report.

Sentencing is therefore adjourned, with relevant notice to be given to all parties for fix of the final hearing date. The clerk is directed to record these remarks for formal transcription under Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Rules. The defendant is advised of his statutory right of appeal in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.

These are the orders of the court.
