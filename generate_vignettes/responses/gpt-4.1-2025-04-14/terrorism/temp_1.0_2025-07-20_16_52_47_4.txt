IN THE CROWN COURT AT LAMBETH

R v. Mr H

Case No. LB/2025/74019

Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge S. E. Fenwick

Dated: 8 August 2025

Mr H, you appear before this court for sentence in respect of three counts: (1) engaging in conduct in preparation for acts of terrorism, contrary to section 5(1)(a) Terrorism Act 2006; (2) possessing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to section 58(1)(b) Terrorism Act 2000; and (3) dissemination of terrorist publications, contrary to section 2 of the Terrorism Act 2006. The period of offending spans from 2 February 2023 until your arrest on 19 May 2025. You are represented by Mr Marcus Sutherland of Counsel, instructed by Oak Lane Solicitors under a representation order. The Crown is represented by Ms Juliet Francis. Both have addressed the court at length and with professionalism, and I am grateful for their submissions, as well as for the support provided by the associate members of the Probation Service in readiness for this hearing.

Procedurally, this matter came before the court for an initial appearance on 26 May 2025, having been transferred from South London Magistrates’ Court following the serving of an indictment on 21 May 2025. There have been several pre-trial hearings, including a hearing on 17 June 2025 which was adjourned owing to the late provision of digital disclosure from the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command (“SO15”). At the subsequent case management hearing on 24 June 2025, the defendant entered pleas of guilty to all three counts. The lateness of these pleas was the subject of some debate during submissions, to which I will return when considering the appropriate credit for plea.

A further matter delayed the listing of the present hearing. The interpreter service failed to attend the adjourned date of 1 July, and a query arose as to whether the defendant required assistance under section 104 of the Equality Act 2010, owing to a declared visual impairment; after expeditious efforts by the court’s listing officer, those matters have now been resolved. It is fair to acknowledge—and I do so formally—the diligence of the internal administrative staff at the Lambeth Crown Centre, who have throughout these proceedings managed an expanding and increasingly complex caseload with admirable composure. It is, regrettably, evidence of a nationwide strain on criminal justice infrastructure, and a silent reminder of the knock-on effects of funding cuts, staff attrition, and the unpredictabilities now facing all court users.

I am required to consider the Sentencing Council’s guidelines for Terrorism Offences (effective from October 2023), specifically those parts relating to offences under sections 5 and 58 of the relevant Acts. I am further guided by the appellate authorities of R v. Kahar & Others [2016] EWCA Crim 568, which reaffirmed the primacy of public protection and deterrence, as well as the analysis more recently set out in R v. Hussain [2023] EWCA Crim 87 and R v. Bashir [2024] EWCA Crim 1182, both of which considered elements of ideological sophistication and the persistent risk posed by self-radicalising defendants absent clear links to organised networks.

Much has been made in recent years—by practitioners and commentators alike—of the effect of protracted delays in the listing and disposition of terrorism cases, particularly in the aftermath of the 2022 national barristers’ industrial action. That legacy is again evident here. The Crown acknowledge that, between April and August 2024, resourcing constraints in SO15’s digital forensics unit led to a backlog of over 9,000 untriaged devices. In this case, evidential triage had to be prioritised by reference to investigative urgency, and although the delay is not ultimately laid at the door of the defendant, it inevitably curtailed the timetable for legal team preparation. It cannot be overlooked that backlogs of this magnitude perpetuate a cycle of uncertainty which frustrates witness engagement, defence diligence, and – most pointedly – public confidence.

The facts of the present case have been placed before the court in comprehensive form via an agreed schedule between the parties. I am satisfied that these facts are an accurate and concise record of the conduct for which the defendant now stands to be sentenced.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

It is necessary to observe the context in which agencies were able to cooperate in this investigation. The prosecution’s case was significantly strengthened by the prompt activation of the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (“MAPPA: Level 3”), triggered upon the receipt of intelligence from the City of Westminster’s Prevent Coordinator in February 2025. This activation resulted in a roundtable conference attended by the London Regional Probation Director, Detective Inspector Amy Gallimore of SO15, and Dr Fergus Feldman—consultant forensic psychiatrist, to whom I owe thanks for the detail and clarity of his subsequent written report. I note that Dr Feldman, who conducted structured interviews with Mr H during his remand at HMP Thameside, concluded that there was “no diagnosable major mental disorder affecting capacity or intent,” but did highlight a “gamified orientation to online ideological identity exploration” that merits further scrutiny. The court is not equipped to make clinical judgements, but where such risk factors overlap with offending, they must be considered within an integrated risk management strategy post-release.

Whilst preparing these remarks, I reviewed lengthy correspondence submitted from the defendant’s father, Mr Innes H, and supporting representations from the Southwark Community Resilience Trust, the manager of which, Ms Priya Ullal, attested to Mr H’s “sporadic but appreciated” participation in their weekly debate society prior to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. I make no findings as to the import of this participation: positive community engagement is generally mitigating, but not where, as here, it is bookended by entrenched and ideologically-motivated offending. In such circumstances, reference letters carry limited weight.

Additional mention must be made of the commendable efforts of the London Prevent network and its sub-unit, the Hackney Channel Panel, who, despite increasing resistance in public discourse to so-called “pre-crime” interventions, have persevered in their inter-agency work. Panel Chair Mr Mark Nkomo appended a signed statement to the case file, documenting five unsuccessful attempts to engage Mr H between July 2022 and April 2023: direct outreach, scheduled “challenge calls,” and invitations to two digital literacy workshops all met with non-engagement or last-minute withdrawal. It is noteworthy that the panel refrained from any broad-brush accusations, confining their submissions to an unvarnished chronology.

On the issue of sentencing credit, I am bound to revisit the guidance on the timing and authenticity of guilty pleas. R v. Hanratty [2021] EWCA Crim 2032, a case concerning a series of late-shift armed robberies in the South Midlands, is instructive in re-affirming that credit for late pleas—pleas entered only after pre-trial applications to exclude evidence have been dismissed—must not be allowed to subvert the rationale of sentence reduction as a token of remorse or procedural economy. Mr Hanratty, having initially denied all offences, changed his plea in open court only once the last, most damaging CCTV footage was finally adduced. The court allowed a discount of only 12%, holding that tactical admissions made under pressure of overwhelming evidence disclose, at best, an acknowledgment of reality—not a moment of contrition. Such observations are as pertinent in this context as they were to Mr Hanratty. The present defendant entered his pleas only following the dismissal of several substantial defence applications: first, to exclude encrypted chat logs as “tainted by cross-jurisdictional evidence gathering,” and second, to prevent the admission of certain digital artefacts said to be outside the scope of the warrant.

I turn to a short outline of the main facts:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

It is important to record that the Crown, in formulating its case, relied extensively upon expert evidence provided by Ms Tanya Travers, Principal Analyst with the Metropolitan Police’s Cyber Investigative Support Team. In her report, Ms Travers detailed the nature and content of the information found on the defendant’s encrypted partitions. The defence sought to challenge her conclusions by pointing to partial file corruption and the open-source nature of much of the supporting material. The question, of course, is not whether an individual may lawfully possess open-source design specifications under ordinary circumstances, but rather, what purpose and context formed the backdrop to their possession in this case. The court is guided by the reasoning in R v. Poole & Others [2020] EWCA Crim 1903, which established that intent “may be gleaned inferentially from surrounding acts and statements, even where materials are incomplete or corrupted.” Accordingly, the assertion that a significant fraction of the relevant downloaded archive was “inaccessible to the defendant” does not, on the evidence before me, weigh significantly in assessment of risk or culpability.

The record should further reflect that the Crown also placed reliance on witness evidence given by Mr Enzo Calvetti, a digital security consultant who—though his area of expertise is commonly in commercial banking fraud—has been seconded for two years to the National Communications Data Advisory Service. Mr Calvetti confirmed that a communications event on 12 February 2025 involving a VPN “hop chain” across Croatian, Finnish, and Spanish exit nodes was undertaken with sufficient operational security to mask all but the initial “handshake” from even sophisticated monitoring. While this court need not catalogue the entire technical armamentarium at issue, such evidence has an inevitable bearing on culpability, and on the sophistication required to obtain, disseminate, or deploy materials for a terrorist purpose.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

For the avoidance of doubt, the court records that, at the time of Mr H’s arrest, unrelated items were also found in the shared household: a single cannabis joint in the kitchen bin and two blank shotgun cartridges in a utility drawer. It transpires those belonged to the defendant’s co-tenant, Mr Aimery LaCroix, who is himself currently before the Ealing Magistrates’ Court on an unrelated matter involving public order and the alleged theft of copper cabling from a rail depot in Hammersmith. Neither of those items pertain in any way to Mr H’s present offending or risk profile, and I do not take them into account for sentencing purposes.

It has been argued, in a character reference submitted by Ms Rowena Hughes—a librarian at Dulwich Public Library—that Mr H exhibited “genuine curiosity and diligence” as a frequent reader, often borrowing historical tomes on Middle Eastern antiquity. The suggestion has been made that his digital conduct derived from a desire for knowledge rather than malign intent. Such distinctions, though helpful in understanding background context, must give way to objective facts when the volume and nature of the downloaded and disseminated material go well beyond ordinary academic pursuit.

The court is mindful of guidance found in R v. Abernathy [2020] EWCA Crim 1169, a matter concerning the importation of a prohibited weapon under the guise of antique collection. There, the appellant, a self-described militaria enthusiast, was charged with possession of a disguised firearm: a World War II-era lipstick gun. Though the panel recognised his bona fide interest in war memorabilia, the judgment cautioned that “sincere hobby interests do not insulate a defendant from criminal responsibility when prohibited items are possessed in circumstances said to heighten public alarm.” The basic principle extends, mutatis mutandis, to the present facts.

Of tangential procedural note, the court experienced a two-day delay to the defendant’s bail review hearing on 10 July 2025 due to strike action among probation officers and administrative staff, which resulted in a backlog of pre-sentence reports awaiting allocation. I record this not to attribute fault but to highlight the chronic operational pressures on the Probation Service—stretched almost to breaking point in the face of rising caseloads and increasingly complex risk presentations. In this case, albeit with inevitable delay, both the preliminary and updated pre-sentence reports were eventually made available, and I record my gratitude to Ms Penelope Manning for the thoroughness with which those reports were prepared.

In considering sentences for terrorism offences involving digital dissemination, the court remains attentive to recent appellate consideration in R v. Qureshi [2022] EWCA Crim 1461 and R v. Gilhooly [2022] EWCA Crim 1792. In the latter, the panel examined the case of an individual of no previous convictions who had uploaded encrypted 3D printer files for the production of so-called “ghost guns” to peer-to-peer platforms frequented by domestic extremists. There, notwithstanding significant mitigation relating to the defendant’s background, a lengthy custodial sentence was nevertheless deemed inevitable in view of the serious and persistent risk presented.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

Turning briefly to the wider context: it is inescapable that the burden of national security falls disproportionately on a succession of under-resourced public agencies, pressed into a state of near-constant prioritisation. It is no secret to those sitting in the Crown Courts that the pressure on digital forensics teams, public housing officers, and anti-radicalisation professionals has reached unsustainable levels. Public expectations of seamless, real-time oversight run up against resource allocation, legal constraint, and unavoidable technological change. The gap between state capacity and public demand is a theme that reverberates throughout not just this case, but in every complex, resource-intensive prosecution before these courts. Court users and the wider public sometimes fail to appreciate the real cost of extracting, analysing, and presenting terabytes of encrypted data—costs measured not just in man-hours, but in ordinary policing foregone.

For context, I wish to remark upon the increasing reliance by both sides on material generated or processed through artificial intelligence. I make special note of the defence’s expert, Dr Lydia Win, who provided a technical statement on the plausibility of deepfakes and synthetic identity files being inadvertently downloaded by users with a broad interest in internet security matters. Her written report, though academically robust and full of insight regarding the limitations of AI-driven malware detection, does not counteract the finding that Mr H’s possession and curation of certain files was not accidental but both wilful and deliberate.

The continuing, if frequently misunderstood, theme of “public confidence in sentencing” warrants a brief comment. There remains a disjunction in many quarters between the sentence delivered and perceptions of proportionality—exacerbated, perhaps, by the opacity of digital evidence, the complexity of encryption, and the general suspicion with which the public now regards institutional authority. Sentencing for terrorism is not, however, a matter of social consensus or popular demand: it is a task circumscribed by law, tempered by principle, and informed throughout by the objective of safeguarding the public from harm.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

The process of forensic tracing in this case unearthed a series of cryptocurrency transfers between electronic wallets registered to anonymised aliases said to be operated on the “dark web.” The sums—while not on the scale seen in the most notorious of international terrorism finance cases—were significant in context, and bear the hallmarks of obfuscatory technique commonly associated with the procurement of restricted materials. It is not for this court to make findings as to the prevalence of cryptocurrencies in modern terrorism, but it cannot be gainsaid that such payments are now a well-trodden pathway for those seeking to evade conventional oversight, as detailed with clarity in the National Crime Agency’s 2025 annual report.

For completeness, the court notes that during the search of the defendant’s premises, officers also recovered an assortment of musical instruments and rare vinyl records, apparently belonging to a previous tenant, Ms Sabine Tran. It is not suggested by either party that these items are relevant to the offence, nor are they considered in any aspect of sentencing.

I note, too, by way of procedural record, that the Legal Aid Agency’s approval for the defence’s request for a second digital evidence expert was obtained only after three appeals and required written representations lodged by senior counsel. Such bureaucratic inertia is regrettable and cannot, where possible, be allowed to impede the resolution of serious public protection cases. The pressure placed on the defence by truncated funding or delayed approval is real, and I express the court’s appreciation for the perseverance exhibited by Mr Sutherland and his team.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Turning to personal circumstances, Mr H is now 31 years old, previously of no convictions save for a historical caution for minor criminal damage at age 17. The pre-sentence and psychiatric reports agree in describing him as “intellectually able, technically gifted and socially withdrawn.” Defence have put forward—through the testimony of family members and one former academic referee—evidence of Mr H’s voluntary work with neighbourhood clean-up initiatives throughout 2022. Whilst civic good deeds are, in many contexts, impressive, their value here is tempered by the weight of the present offences, which by their nature undermine, rather than reinforce, the moral and social compact at the heart of our system.

Defence additionally place in mitigation a letter from Mr H’s former employer, Southbank Computer Services Ltd, whose managing director, Mr Abdul Dey, characterises the defendant as “efficient and capable of working unsupervised over extended periods without supervision.” That observation, while clearly intended as a mark of personal reliability, takes on, in the present context, a somewhat different resonance. The capacity for covert, self-directed operation is, in certain contexts, not mitigating but aggravating.

I take, however, full account of the expert opinion of Dr Feldman (to which I have already alluded), that Mr H is assessed as presenting a “current, significant, but potentially manageable” risk of further ideologically-motivated offending on release, contingent on sustained engagement with deradicalisation interventions and, if necessary, electronic monitoring. The risk management protocols—detailed most notably in the forensic risk assessment report commissioned by the South London Probation Office—must therefore be front and centre in any sentence and supervision order contemplated by the court.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

The overall pattern established by the conduct under scrutiny is one of high sophistication, persistence, and deliberate effort to evade detection. The cumulative effect of the preparation, possession, and dissemination offences places this case in the highest culpability bracket under the current sentencing guidelines. Section 5 of the 2006 Act carries a maximum of life imprisonment. The risk to public safety disclosed is significant and ongoing. There are, nevertheless, some limited mitigating factors: an absence of prior convictions and evidence that, once the full weight of the prosecution evidence became unassailable, the defendant abandoned his contested position and entered guilty pleas, sparing the need for a three- or four-week trial at public expense.

The court orders that the Probation Service prepare a full pre-sentence report addressing the suitability of an Extended Determinate Sentence (per section 226A Criminal Justice Act 2003), and, where appropriate, the conditions required for management of risk on licence, including but not limited to exclusion zones, intensive MAPPA supervision, and engagement with the Desistance and Disengagement Programme (DDP). The report should also take input from Forensic Psychology regarding the appropriateness of Structured Professional Judgement (SPJ-10) tools for ongoing assessment. Final sentence will be determined on receipt and consideration of all relevant materials, alongside any updated representations from the parties.

These are the orders of the court.
