IN THE CROWN COURT AT MIDDLESBROUGH  
R v. MR H  
Case No. T2025/02365  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge RONA S. GALLAGHER  
Filed: 17 September 2025  

Mr H, you stand before this court to be sentenced for one count of theft from a shop, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The circumstances giving rise to your conviction are familiar but by no means inconsequential, involving behaviour that has both immediate and wider repercussions for the community, for local businesses, and for the social order upon which we all depend.

Let me begin by reciting the procedural chronology that has brought us to today's hearing. The offence in question occurred on 15 April 2025, at the premises of a retail store situated on Parliament Road in Middlesbrough. Your subsequent arrest was effected by officers of the Cleveland Police at approximately 16:30 on the same day, following a call to police control from the store’s on-site security team. You were taken initially to the South Ayresome Custody Suite, where you were interviewed under caution the following morning, pursuant to Code C of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.

It is necessary to record that there have been two prior adjournments in relation to the listing of this case. The original plea and trial preparation hearing was fixed in the Crown Court for 5 June. However, that hearing was vacated at the Crown's request on 2 June, because further CCTV material required collation and disclosure. I note that the StoreWatch Programme, under the auspices of the Middlesbrough Retailers’ Liaison Network, supplied a number of incident logs only after the initial hearing was vacated. The preparatory work involved cross-referencing four separate incident reports spanning a 38-day period, which, as is regrettably common, resulted in considerable delay. The hearing eventually proceeded on 17 July.

That the matter could not be dispositioned at first instance is, regrettably, typical in such prosecutions. The burgeoning administrative weight carried by local police, retail partners, and case progression officers is hardly new, yet it is rendered no less burdensome by its frequency. In the period between the two preliminary hearings, I am informed that the defence experienced further difficulty in obtaining disclosure of the entirety of the store’s security video archives. These materials were, eventually, provided as large digital files, requiring review on equipment not provided within the standard Legal Aid provision. It is worth stating for the public record the court’s appreciation for the considerable patience shown by both counsel—Ms Natalie Winfield, who appears today for the Crown, and Ms Gabrielle O’Connell, who appears for the defence under a representation order.

I turn briefly to the question of legal aid and administrative support. The delays caused by repeated requests for funding by the defence so as to instruct an independent psychologist are not the subject of direct judicial criticism in these remarks; nonetheless, it would be fanciful to deny the corrosive effect of such bureaucracy on the effective operation of the criminal justice system. The court received no fewer than four separate email notifications from the Legal Aid Agency between June and August, each requesting a marginally different form of justification for the proposed expenditure. It was not until 8 August that funding was finally granted, and the consequent expert report received in full only on 28 August. The procedural vacuum thereby created did justice no credit.

This present case falls within a wider pattern of acquisitive offending in the borough of Middlesbrough. In line with national trends, the local force reports a 19% rise year-on-year in recorded retail theft, a figure broadly corroborated by the Home Office’s February 2025 Business Crime Statistics for North East subregions. The causative milieu for this uptick is, of course, complex: it emerges at the intersection of persistent deprivation, post-pandemic volatility in retail staffing, the proliferation of late-opening convenience stores, and resource shortages among neighbourhood policing teams. It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge as well the strain imposed by the now-normal phenomenon of rolling store closures and consolidations among major retail chains.

The role of the Participating Retailer Partnership (PRP) must be noted. On 20 April, the Partnership convened an extraordinary meeting of local shop managers—eleven in total —specifically to discuss repeated targeting of small-format retailers within the Southfield ward. The minutes of that meeting, included in the court papers, contain reference to a pattern of what the Association now deems “impact incidents,” that is, acts not simply of direct loss, but of intimidation or disruption which destabilise staff welfare, shift patterns or opening hours. 

It is a persistent lament—often repeated by those who have not had to prepare witness care schedules or organize hurried cover for nervous shop staff—that such offences are “low-level,” as though value alone were a complete index of harm. Shoplifting may seem minor in the eyes of the statisticians, but those on the frontline are acutely aware that the harm is not merely pecuniary, but social and psychological. The staff, often young or employed on insecure hours, bear a disproportionate share of disruption, distress, and sometimes, the residue of threat. 

It is instructive to recall the framework laid down by the Sentencing Council for theft offences, effective from 1 February 2016, which emphasises that “the impact on victims and the sense of violation experienced by staff is material, quite apart from the value of stolen goods.” The persistent targeting of small businesses or repeated entry after formal bans is a recognised aggravating factor, as is the psychological effect occasioned. That guidance has been reaffirmed most recently in the revised February 2023 published guideline. 

I have considered the submissions of the Crown in their entirety. It is of note that the prosecution relied on evidence supplied by the Safer Middlesbrough Partnership, whose community impact statement—that of Ms Claire Duxbury, Partnership Coordinator—describes “a rolling cycle of repeat thefts, resulting in store closures during certain hours and a measurable increase in staff turnover.” This court received a written statement from a store assistant who has since left employment at the site in question, citing both fear of confrontation and loss of confidence.

Turning to the facts of the case as established in open court, having now reviewed the exhibits and considered the agreed narrative, I recite the following summary as relevant to sentence:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

I must also address the circumstances surrounding your apprehension on 15 April. The store’s CCTV footage, enhanced by video analytics at the request of the StoreWatch Network, was instrumental in confirming your movements within the premises between 16:08 and 16:27. It is noted that you previously visited the same store on 24 March and 29 March, actions fully documented in incident reports submitted to the police but not prosecuted as discrete counts either for reasons of evidential sufficiency or prosecutorial discretion.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

The practical effect of your conduct, Mr H, extends beyond material loss. There has been clear evidence that the continued experience of repeated shoplifting has forced the store in question—like many others in the region—to reduce evening opening hours, restrict customer access, and review lone working arrangements for its staff. The Retailers’ Association, in their representations to this court, underscore that such changes are not cost-neutral; they involve both increased security expenditure and the erosion of the community role such shops have traditionally played.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

I also take account of the written submissions from the North-East Business Crime Forum and the Middlesbrough Victim Recovery Service. Each of those organisations has, in detailed correspondence, stressed the cumulative effect of ongoing acquisitive crime, not least in creating the “chilling effect” described in recent research by the University of Teesside’s Institute for Public Safety Studies.

Before turning to sentence, I am obliged to canvass the wider social and policy context. There exist those who habitually conflate explanation with exculpation, arguing that deprivation, addiction, or mental health crises somehow strip individuals of responsibility. There is, undeniably, a kernel of truth in the recognition that crime does not occur in a vacuum. The North East region faces a higher-than-average rate of long-term economic inactivity, housing instability, and pronounced health inequalities. The council’s Social Inclusion Audit for 2024/25 makes sobering reading in this regard—household food insecurity up 15% year-on-year, a reported 31% of all adults in receipt of Universal Credit, and a rapid upsurge in presentations at emergency housing services.

I am, of course, bound by law not sociological conjecture. But it would be disingenuous to pretend that the context is irrelevant to either cause or cure. Too often social collapse is allowed to masquerade as mere individual failing, and too often personal responsibility is crowded out by the language of “structural factors” or “trajectories of risk.” Both account for some part of the picture, but never the whole.

In this context, I turn to the expert report provided by Dr Lawrence M. Forster, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, dated 28 August 2025. Dr Forster’s assessment, conducted in-person at HMP Holme House on 19 August and accompanied by a collateral interview with your keyworker at Foundations Supported Housing, concludes as follows: “Mr H demonstrates some symptoms consistent with an emotionally unstable personality structure, with attendant impulsivity and affective volatility. There is a mild substance misuse component—a pattern of intermittent amphetamine and cannabis use—but at a level falling below criteria for clinical substance dependence. Cognitive testing did not reveal deficits sufficient to impair decision-making capacity.” Dr Forster further observes that “the defendant’s engagement with therapeutic support in the community has been inconsistent, characterised by brief periods of participation in Talking Therapies, followed by non-attendance and disengagement.”

I consider also the pre-sentence report authored by Probation Officer Ms L. White. Ms White’s appraisal is thorough, if somewhat gloomy in its prognosis. She notes a “pattern of transient accommodation, estrangement from primary family of origin, and limited insight into the impact of offending behaviour upon others.” You are presently housed at a “crash pad” provision managed by NorthEast Support Project, with no evidence of regular employment since 2023 and sporadic engagement with statutory support. Against the context of your acute housing instability, Ms White highlights an “increased risk of reoffending absent structured community support and a package of stabilising interventions.”

Where personal circumstances are invoked, it is essential that courts do not mistake adversity for a blank cheque or an entitlement to impunity. To the contrary, there is an expectation that any hardship, whether material or psychological, is met with efforts to engage with support when available. Your case, as documented, is marked by periods of withdrawal from support on grounds that are both circumstantial and—to an extent—self-determined.

It is necessary at this stage to set out the sentencing framework engaged by your offending. You have entered a plea of guilty—but only at the trial window, following the denial of an application to exclude key CCTV footage. There has been no indication of remorse save for a brief, standing apology addressed to the court last month. The principle governing sentence reduction for a guilty plea is now firmly established by section F of the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline and most recently reaffirmed in R v Moughan [2022] EWCA Crim 1848, where it was held: “The lateness of a plea, particularly one entered after a contested voir dire, is a relevant factor in the degree of credit afforded. The credit is to be commensurate with both the practical and symbolic benefit to justice.”

I pause, as is customary, to survey the precedents which shape the present sentencing exercise. The much-cited authority of R v Cresswell [2020] EWCA Crim 1152 — a case involving a 31-year-old with a persistent record of shoplifting and related antisocial conduct — established that, notwithstanding the absence of direct violence, cumulative offending in the retail context can cross the custody threshold. The defendant in Cresswell targeted local small businesses on multiple occasions, amassing losses which, though individually minor, aggregated to a significant sum. Though little direct physical harm resulted, the defendant’s intrusion into a community grocer led to repeated staff absences, increased security costs, and the eventual curtailment of evening trading hours at two local stores. The sentence of 14 months’ immediate custody was upheld, with the Court of Appeal stressing the broader disruptiveness of “patterned acts of low-level dishonesty.”

It is also salient to consider R v Martel [2019] EWCA Crim 743, where the defendant’s shoplifting at a large chain—though persistent—did not directly result in staff intimidation. There, a suspended sentence order was upheld in light of significant mitigation: evidenced mental health difficulties, a pattern of longstanding engagement with addiction recovery, and an early guilty plea. In that instance, the court found that the possibility of ongoing rehabilitation tipped the balance away from immediate custody.

Further, the Crown has drawn my attention to the authority of R v Jeffords [2024] EWCA Crim 1911, concerning the burglary of a small private dwelling during a summer holiday absence. Although Mr Jeffords was not before this court, the case is instructive for its treatment of culpability in domestic setting offences. There, the court noted the particular gravity where a home had been entered with the knowledge of its occupation, with sentences reflecting the enduring psychological distress suffered by householders. While the factual matrix diverges from the present shoplifting matter, Jeffords is a salutary reminder of the distinctions the courts are required to draw between types of property-related harm.

Of further note is the judgment in R v Barkley [2021] EWCA Crim 2200—an importation case involving wholesale quantities of Class A drugs sent via parcel freight across regional boundaries. The defendant, a warehouse picker recruited without full knowledge of the scheme’s scale, claimed coercion by way of threats to his family. The Court held that while coercion can be a significant mitigating factor, it cannot absolve an individual from responsibility where active participation is voluntary and protracted. Again, the factual scenario is not analogous to the instant offence, but the sentencing logic—concerning personal culpability amidst external pressure—offers a useful point of reference.

I am also obliged to observe that the prosecution’s bundle included a recent report concerning the successful prosecution of fly-tipping by a commercial operator on South Gare marshes, outside this court’s immediate jurisdiction but relevant to the broader question of public confidence in the sanctions available for repeated minor offending. While the specific harm there was environmental—resulting in the destruction of marshland and the loss of habitat for ground-nesting birds—the principle animating sentence was the need for effective deterrence in the face of persistent disregard for shared norms. The public, in no small measure, measures its faith in the rule of law by whether the system is seen to hold chronic miscreants to account.

Turning then to the facts, as recounted by the probation officer and in the summary supplied to the court:

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

In the addendum to the pre-sentence report, it is recorded that your most recent engagement with a local support service was on 3 August 2025, when you attended a single session at OpenDoor Advice Centre but did not return. Staff observed you to be “anxious, distracted, and reluctant to discuss future plans.” There is no evidence before the court of any engagement thereafter.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

It is perhaps superfluous to observe, but this court is routinely presented with cases in which defendants assert, either in oral mitigation or through written submissions, histories of social disadvantage, placement in the care system, experience of neglect, or childhood trauma. While these background circumstances are features which the court takes very seriously, it is essential to state plainly that they neither require nor justify a departure from the general sentencing framework, nor—save in rare and exceptional cases—do they provide grounds for imposing a non-custodial disposal where the custody threshold is plainly crossed.

The Crown has further sought to adduce summary evidence of your previous convictions. You have, since 2015, accrued four previous convictions for offences of theft (all shoplifting), with the most recent conviction being in 2022. In that instance, you received a community order with a requirement to attend a six-week “Respecting Property” workshop. The progress report filed by the Community Rehabilitation Company at that time noted “sporadic attendance, with refusal to engage in core modules.” On that occasion, the court was able to find the engagement sufficiently promising to justify an order in lieu of custody. The current case, however, presents evidence of pattern and persistence.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

I note, for completeness, that the prosecution did not seek to prove any association between you and the co-defendant, Mr D. Abbot, who failed to appear during the initial phase of the investigation and remains at large. It is also recorded that the current probation officer responsible for your case is not the same officer previously involved, owing to an internal review of caseload distribution at the NorthEast Probation Delivery Unit. This turnover is not uncommon and is reflective, more widely, of chronic staff shortages and mounting attrition within the Probation Service. These disruptions are not, of course, a matter for your culpability, nor will they serve as mitigation.

The addendum medical material also references an episode in 2021, in which you allegedly presented to James Cook University Hospital with a superficial laceration sustained in the context of an altercation at a city centre bus interchange. While defense submissions initially sought to introduce this as evidence of vulnerability to violence, the Crown quite properly observed that the incident was not recorded as a criminal allegation and involved no prosecution. Nor, on review, does it affect the present sentencing exercise.

This court is acutely aware of the burdens placed on local business by the slow pace of criminal justice disposals. The chairman of the Middlesbrough Small Traders’ Alliance, Mr Yusuf Sadiq, has written to the court to record that three premises targeted in the last calendar year have been forced to reduce staff headcount or close secondary locations due to persistent low-value theft. These are not abstract economic losses; they are substantively connected to job losses and, for many families, the loss of what had been a reliable anchor point in the local economy.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

Victim impact statements filed by the premises manager highlight broader community consequences. There is reference to the intimidation felt by junior staff, reluctance of new hires to take on evening shifts, and a discernible drop in trade during the affected period. That harm, though indirect, falls squarely within what the Sentencing Council now describes as the “cumulative adverse impact” of repeat offending.

Further, during the sentencing hearing on 5 September 2025, the court received representations from two local charitable organisations, Neighbourhood Solutions and the St. Paul’s Food Bank. Both attested to your sporadic presence at their premises—most recently in April—and to your refusal of structured support on those occasions. The core of your personal mitigation, as advanced by Ms O’Connell, pivots on the asserted collapse of your informal support network following the departure of your partner from the borough in late 2024. While the court does not doubt that such upheaval is difficult, it cannot be said to account for the continuity of your offending.

In the interests of completeness, and for the avoidance of any ambiguity, I place on record that there is no evidence linking you to the matters presently under investigation concerning the unlawful fly-tipping of electrical waste on North Ormesby Common, nor to the affray resulting from a disorder at the “Coach and Horses” public house on Marton Road on 18 March 2025. Those incidents are not before this court and play no part in sentencing.

Your letter to the court, handwritten and neat, is thoughtful and apologetic in tone. I accept that you experience shame at the predicament in which you find yourself, and I note without criticism your observation that “sometimes it is easier to not even try” when faced with repeated hardship. The decision to present that letter, rather than delegate all explanation to counsel, does at least demonstrate some capacity for reflection.

Against that background, I must turn to the issue of risk assessment and rehabilitation. Ms White’s pre-sentence report identifies you as presenting a “medium to high risk of reconviction in the absence of tailored intervention.” Participation in substance misuse services, stable accommodation, and psycho-social skills development are cited as pre-conditions for de-escalation of risk. The court takes seriously the need, wherever possible, to structure interventions that support reintegration rather than exclusion.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

I further record, for completeness, the efforts of Middlesbrough Borough Council’s Community Street Triage, who upon your last presentation at their drop-in in May 2025, sought to initiate a referral to a local mental health recovery programme. That outreach was not, on the evidence, sustained.

The broader question of capacity within the local probation and social services infrastructure is relevant but not dispositive. This region, like many others, faces a backlog of referrals for both housing and mental health services; recent data from the Cleveland Probation Service indicates a caseload average 37% above the recommended cap. That reality—regrettable though it is—cannot be the basis for unqualified mitigation, but it does illuminate the real-world context in which community disposals are to be constructed.

Finally, I acknowledge the procedural vicissitudes of the listing process. The court was compelled to relist this matter twice owing to a national clerical strike, with one half-day hearing lost due to the late arrival of the court interpreter. The proceedings have otherwise conformed to the requirements of open justice, with no reporting restrictions imposed beyond those that arise by operation of law.

I will conclude by inviting the probation service to prepare a comprehensive pre-sentence report, with particular attention to community-based programs, risk management, and the viability of alternatives to immediate custody, subject always to the constraints established by statute and guideline authority. All sentencing options remain open at this stage and will fall to be determined upon consideration of that report and upon receipt of any further representations from counsel.

These are the orders of the court.
