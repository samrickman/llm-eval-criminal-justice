IN THE CROWN COURT AT HALSEY SQUARE  
R v. Mr H  
Case No. C523/2025  
Sentencing Remarks – Her Honour Judge P. T. RAWLINGS  
Filed: 7 April 2025  

Mr H, you are before this court for sentencing following your conviction for offences of theft from shop premises, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. The court has carefully reviewed the background to your offending, the procedural history of this case, the submissions made on your behalf and by the Crown, and the detailed reports prepared by probation and psychiatric professionals. I now set out the reasoning that will inform the court’s ultimate sentencing decision.  

The procedural context of your case is, regrettably, emblematic of the challenges routinely faced by this jurisdiction in managing low-level but persistent acquisitive offending. This matter was first brought before the Camberwell Green Magistrates’ Court on 15 January 2025, where the court declined jurisdiction on the basis that, while the monetary value of the alleged thefts was not excessive, the pattern of conduct, its impact on the local business community, and your personal antecedents rendered summary disposal inappropriate. The case was accordingly sent to this court pursuant to section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. You appeared before me on 24 February for a plea and trial preparation hearing; at that hearing, you entered a not guilty plea, and the matter was set down for trial on 5 March.  

From the outset, case progression was subject to the sorts of procedural delays and administrative frustrations that have become all too commonplace. It is a fact not lightly passed over that the initial appointment of Mr Julius Sethi, of Silver Partners Solicitors, was delayed by a failure to process the required Legal Aid representation order—a bureaucratic oversight traced to a technical malfunction within the Agency’s client verification system. While inconvenience of this kind is no longer extraordinary, it gives rise to particular concern in cases where the personal liberty of a defendant, whatever the crime, hangs in the balance. I record my thanks, nonetheless, to both Mr Sethi and his successor, Ms Emily Jarrett, for their tenacity and professionalism in ensuring continuity of representation.  

The subsequent listing of this matter before a jury was subject to yet further delay when, on 3 March, the court building was temporarily closed following a fire alarm activation in the adjoining administrative wing. It later transpired that the incident was the result of a failed electronic security test, rather than any external threat, but it did necessitate the rescheduling of all criminal cases originally timed for that morning. Once again, the burden of such disruption often falls disproportionately upon those least responsible for its genesis, whether they be witnesses, legal practitioners, or the defendants themselves. The court notes, for the record, the professionalism of court staff and ushers in managing the resulting congestion, and commends the adaptability of counsel in progressing this matter with minimal further disruption.  

The matter proceeded to trial before me sitting without a jury on 14 March, after your counsel—correctly—indicated your consent under section 16 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, in light of ongoing listing pressures and the modest complexity of the evidentiary matrix. The prosecution was represented throughout by Ms Serena Traynor, whose case summary and closing submissions were admirably concise and thorough. The Crown’s evidence comprised CCTV footage, witness statements from retail staff, and supporting documentation, including stock loss ledgers. Your account was tested in cross-examination; the factual findings which led to conviction are now chronicled in the official record.  

In determining the appropriate sentence, I am duty-bound to refer to the Sentencing Council’s definitive guideline for theft offences, most recently revised in 2021. The guideline directs the court to assess culpability, harm, and relevant aggravating and mitigating features. The consideration of harm cannot be confined to the immediate loss resulting from the offending, but must encompass the broader impact upon individual shop staff, the retail sector’s confidence in the justice system, and the wider public interest in the maintenance of civic order.  

It must, furthermore, be noted that the persistent and ultimately corrosive effect of repeat shop theft on small businesses is a matter about which this court is acutely aware. As has become painfully evident in recent years, dwindling profit margins, disruptions to staffing patterns, and rising insurance premiums mean that each additional loss—however apparently minor—may be the final straw for some independent retailers. I therefore reject the assertion, so commonly advanced in mitigation, that offences of shoplifting are “victimless” or bear little public consequence.  

There is a lamentable tendency, in public discourse and media coverage alike, for such proceedings to be relegated to the margins: significant only when violence is threatened or when the items stolen reach an arbitrary threshold of value. The practical experience, however, is that the insidious normalisation of “petty” theft undermines the sense of security and mutual trust on which retail spaces depend. This is not merely conjecture but is attested by the numerous victim impact statements, both written and oral, which I have reviewed in connection with this case. Several shopworkers spoke movingly of the anxiety and fatigue engendered by repeated thefts, and of their disillusionment with the prospect of meaningful redress.  

It is equally incumbent upon the court not to ignore the structural features that shape and, to some degree, explain patterns of repeat offending. The rise of short-term, casualised work in the retail sector has placed further pressure on stores, whose capacity to implement loss prevention measures is—by their own evidence—stretched to breaking point. The withdrawal of regular community policing patrols, under the strain of resource allocation and chronic staff shortages, is a further complicating factor. I note that in the present case, liaison between the Newcarry Business Watch Partnership and the local police was, by customary standards, prompt and effective in coordinating evidential material and providing support to victims.  

The court has received a pre-sentence report prepared by Mr Peter Fanwell of the Probation Service, dated 28 March 2025. The report offers a comprehensive overview of your personal circumstances, including your history of precarious employment, periods of rough sleeping, and intermittent adherence to mental health support plans. It notes, correctly, that you have endured considerable social disadvantage since childhood. Nevertheless, as I have stated in previous sentencing remarks, hardship can provide context—it cannot serve as an unqualified defence for criminality, much less as a guarantee against the imposition of proportionate penalties. The court is frequently reminded of the manifold “root causes” of persistent offending, whether they be poverty, unstable housing, addiction, or untreated mental health concerns. These origins inform, but do not negate, the central fact that legal and social standards apply irrespective of one’s starting point.  

There is, too, an unfortunate current of public cynicism concerning the value and function of such reports. It is sometimes suggested, with a kind of weary resignation, that the system simply “funnels” cases through a standardised menu of interventions: unpaid work, rehabilitation activity requirements, token referrals to support services. While it is true that resource constraints limit the scope for bespoke or innovative disposals, the present report is distinguished by its attention to your underlying challenges and its sober assessment of risk to the public.  

Reference has already been made in submissions to your medical history. Documentation supplied by Dr Simran Dhaliwal, Consultant Psychiatrist for the South Inner London Community Mental Health Trust, details your previous engagement with psychological services, your periodic prescription of mirtazapine and quetiapine, and your documented difficulties with anxiety management and acute stress reaction. It is not for this court to speculate on the efficacy of individual treatment regimens, but I note that your compliance has been erratic, particularly following your removal from supported accommodation in autumn of last year.

It is regrettable, to say the least, that your attendance at the Tivoli Street Primary Care Centre lapsed following an administrative handover which, so the GP administrative records suggest, resulted in your removal from their patient roster for a period exceeding three months. The explanation proffered by the centre was, in essence, an artefact of digital records migration. Whether avoidable or not, the consequence was a disruption to continuity of care, which may or may not have contributed to your recent instability. I do not accept that this discontinuity provides mitigation of the sort that would warrant the exercise of judicial leniency beyond the limits suggested by the guidelines.

It is against this background that I now turn to the facts of your offending. The Crown’s case was, in all principal respects, supported by direct evidence and contemporaneous records.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_1}

The manner in which the offending was conducted is a proper matter for judicial notice. The prosecution highlighted repeated use of self-service checkout terminals and observation that you selected items during periods of high customer footfall. It was further submitted that you wore layered clothing and concealed goods upon your person before exiting hastily without payment—behaviour captured in whole or in part on located security footage.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_2}

You were first apprehended by local police on 5 February 2025 outside the premises of Red Row MiniMart, following receipt of a call from a shop manager describing a male matching your clothing and physical description. When questioned under caution, you provided a no-comment interview. Upon search, you were found to be carrying a quantity of over-the-counter medicines, confectionery, and two prepaid SIM cards, none of which you could account for by way of receipts.  

Whilst the Crown’s case against you relies primarily on evidence secured from the Red Row location, it must be recorded that this court has weighed the issue of similar fact evidence with considerable care. You were not charged in connection with the earlier incident on Dallison Parade, in which items of value were reported missing following a disturbance involving three other unknown individuals. To that end, I am guided by the authority of R v. Redgrave [2011] EWCA Crim 1779, in which the Court of Appeal reiterated the principle that “prior, unproven allegations of uncharged conduct, standing alone, cannot be deployed as independent foundation for guilt; they may, subject to proper direction, assist in identifying pattern or intention only when sufficient direct evidence supports the principal charge.” Redgrave—a case itself involving unlawful entry and removal of property from a place of worship—provides a cautionary framework for the present circumstances.

It is instructive, although not directly pertinent, to recall the judgment in R v. Hunkin [2018] EWCA Crim 2040, where the defendant, convicted of illicit entry and damage to a railway substation, advanced a defence of mistaken identity based, in part, on the presence of co-defendants later exonerated. There, the Court emphasised that the presence or absence of culpable associates could not operate as a substitute for individual assessment against the specific charges faced. I am satisfied that, on the evidence presented here, your offending was not opportunistic, nor the product of coercion. You acted alone.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_3}

The broader context of persistent acquisitive offending is, I regret to observe, an issue of growing concern for both the criminal courts and society at large. In recent years, the data supplied to the Home Office’s annual crime survey and Business Impact Review indicates a year-on-year rise in incidents of theft targeting small and medium enterprises. Nationally, there were an estimated 380,000 recorded instances of shop theft in 2022, a figure representing a 9% increase on the preceding year. It is noteworthy that the pattern of offending now encompasses not only high-value goods susceptible to secondary resale—such as spirits, electronic accessories, and over-the-counter medicines—but has diffused to encompass a range of lower-value essentials, frequently sought by those facing acute need.

It is neither the function of the courts to undertake a root-and-branch analysis of causation, nor to prescribe systemic solutions. Nonetheless, it would be disingenuous to act as if the persistent overloading of the probation and support services is unconnected to the rising rate of repeat low-level offending. In the courses of preparation for this case, I received—via the Crown—a letter of formal complaint submitted by several local shop proprietors to the Borough Council’s Community Safety Panel. They describe an environment in which the reporting of theft has become all but futile, citing delays in response, complex reporting requirements, and incidents of alleged intimidation from known offenders. The psychological, as much as the economic, impact of this attrition on retail staff is a subject that this court regards gravely.  

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_4}

Your antecedent history details prior cautions for shop theft in 2019, community orders in 2020, and breach of conditions on two occasions in 2022. I further note a fixed penalty notice for littering incurred in July 2021, relating to the disposal of waste material—specifically, fast food wrappers—from a moving vehicle. While such conduct falls outside the purview of the instant sentencing exercise, it is relevant as an indicator of persistent low-level disregard for civic standards.

Reference was made during mitigation to your temporary residence at Parkland Hostel, which has, since September 2024, operated at or above stated capacity. Documentation from Housing Solutions (South Borough), dated 11 October 2024, confirms your eligibility for continued support but recites repeated incidents of late-night curfew breach and involvement in neighbour disputes. I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that you continue to reside in a manner that affords you the basic—and finite—privileges of supported accommodation. It is not acceptable, however, that these resources are placed under increased strain by the additional demands of those who fail, on repeated occasions, to comply with agreed standards of behaviour.

In assessing your personal circumstances, the court is required by section 143 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to have regard to the seriousness of the offence, your prior conduct, and the risk of reoffending. It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the apparent efforts, albeit intermittent, which you have made in seeking employment placement through the SkillsBack Employment Outreach service. Ms Eva Paget, your designated work coach, confirms that you attended two scheduled appointments in January, but that you failed to maintain contact thereafter. While sporadic engagement cannot be weighed as a full mitigating factor, it is not wholly without value in the context of otherwise persistent disengagement. A balanced approach is required.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_5}

Your application for a conditional discharge was advanced by your counsel on the basis of claimed progress with substance misuse management following outreach from the Gresham Street Recovery Hub. The letter from Ms Valerie Twining, the lead support coordinator, details your partial attendance at group sessions and individual meetings with addiction counsellors. The court notes, however, that the most recent contact recorded was on 18 February 2025, and that you failed to attend scheduled appointments in the three weeks preceding the trial. The explanation offered—namely, that you were seeking alternative accommodation as a result of “interpersonal conflict” at Parkland Hostel—was not substantiated by evidence. In these circumstances, I am unable to give weight to claims of sustained progress in recovery.

The Crown points to aggravating features in this matter, notably the targeting of small local businesses rather than national chains, and the limited support available to affected staff. The written statement by Ms Lillian Fenn, assistant manager at Red Row MiniMart, records her distress at repeated losses which, in her words, have led to “reduced hours for cover staff” and “increasing security costs which small shops cannot bear indefinitely.” Such testimony is representative of a trend which, if unchecked, threatens the survival of community stores vital to the economic and social life of the area.

As legal context, I note R v. Ashely [2020] EWCA Crim 1345, in which the Court of Appeal addressed the sentencing of multiple thefts from a charity-run thrift shop. The appellant—who had entered guilty pleas on the day of trial—argued for maximum credit on account of addiction, unstable housing, and expressed remorse. The Court found that while addiction and homelessness are relevant background circumstances, they do not of themselves create a presumption of non-custodial disposal. The broader public interest in deterrence, community protection, and the need to maintain public confidence in the justice system were held to be compelling factors.

In a related but factually distinguishable matter, R v. Dalby [2022] EWCA Crim 1678, the defendant was convicted not of theft, but of conspiracy to commit arson at a commercial premises. Mr Dalby, acting in concert with two associates later acquitted, was found to have supplied accelerant with knowledge that it would be used to set fire to a local business. The trial judge noted the calculated nature of the conspiracy, the potential for widespread harm, and the defendant’s use of coded language in electronic correspondence. The case, while instructive as to judicial reasoning in cases of commercial harm, is not directly applicable to the present matter.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_6}

In terms of public protection, this court is cognisant of the recommendations for multi-agency cooperation in cases where repeated theft signals the possibility of wider criminal or antisocial activity. The Safer Neighbourhood Action Panel, chaired by Inspector Jane Linford, submitted a community impact statement highlighting the compound negative effect of unaddressed shop theft on public perceptions of safety, willingness of local businesses to invest, and the overall vibrancy of affected high streets. While there is no direct evidence that your conduct is linked to organised crime, I recognise that persistent low-level offending, especially in the context of weak deterrent signals, erodes the collective resilience of neighbourhoods.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_7}

A note of clarification must be added: the arresting officer, PC Ruth Oddy, was herself subject to an unrelated internal investigation arising from allegations of excessive force during the arrest of a separate individual at the Newcarry Civic Centre. Those proceedings resulted in no finding of misconduct and have no bearing on the prosecution or outcome of your case. I mention the matter only because the issue was wrongly raised, in passing, during closing submissions. The fairness of your trial is not—and never was—in question.

An administrative issue delayed the reception of psychiatric reports, notably because the South Inner London CMHT was operating on skeleton staff throughout February due to a surge in flu-related absences and the redeployment of two senior clinicians to support local hospital discharge co-ordination. These kinds of challenges—common throughout the health and care sector—should not, in principle, impede court business, but in practice, they invariably do. Such is the ongoing reality of stretched public services.

{INSERT_FACT_SNIPPET_8}

The submissions made on your behalf include a handwritten letter to the court, the content of which was both legible and thoughtfully composed, displaying an awareness—however belated—of the impact your actions have had on the victims, staff, and your own circumstances. You express regret and a wish to “find some stability and rebuild trust with people who have tried to help me.” While the court is naturally sceptical, in light of your past failures to engage formally with support agencies, such sentiments may nonetheless form the basis for a rehabilitative approach should all other factors so indicate.

In considering the appropriate disposal, this court is guided by the principles of proportionality, public confidence, and the rehabilitative potential of any given sentence. It is not lost on me that, while low-level thefts are often the product of adversity and instability, the harm occasioned—particularly to those least able to absorb it—is both real and enduring. Public perception that such offences are treated lightly only deepens disillusionment with the justice system. Equally, it serves no public interest to impose custodial sentences where the evidence suggests that structured support, community orders, and properly resourced probation services are more likely to yield lasting benefit—both to the defendant and to the wider community.

This is a case, I find, that falls within the range for a community order with rehabilitative requirements, in light of your personal circumstances, absence of violence, and incipient (albeit precarious) efforts towards personal reform. The fact that your progress in this regard has thus far been halting and incomplete does not, at this stage, close the door to a community-based intervention.

Pursuant to section 81(1) of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, I direct the preparation of a pre-sentence report by the Probation Service. The report should address, in particular, the suitability of a rehabilitation activity requirement focused on impulse control and problem-solving skills, participation in a Structured Supervision Programme (where available), and the feasibility of unpaid work requirements, having regard to your health and housing status. Assessment should also be made of your motivation to comply with any order, the availability of appropriate support from outreach or counselling services, and any risk factors related to substance misuse.

I will adjourn sentencing until receipt of the further report, which should be completed within 28 days. All options remain open, including the possibility of a suspended sentence order should you fail to demonstrate—through engagement and compliance—a credible prospect of rehabilitation. The matter will return to this court for final disposal on the next available date.

These are the orders of the court.
